Abstract: In comparison with existing approaches, which struggle with scalability, communication dependency, and robustness against dynamic failures, cooperative aerial transportation via robot swarms holds transformative potential for logistics and disaster response. Here, we present a physics-inspired cooperative transportation approach for flying robot swarms that imitates the dissipative mechanics of table-leg load distribution. By developing a decentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous formation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of explicit communication. Based on local neighbor robots and the suspended payload, each robot dynamically adjusts its position. This is similar to energy-dissipating table leg reactions. The stability of the resultant control system is rigorously proved. Simulations demonstrate that the tracking errors of the proposed approach are 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches under the cases of capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and payload variation, respectively. In real-world experiments with six flying robots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success rate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation, and 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor winds up to Beaufort scale 4. Overall, this physics-inspired approach bridges swarm intelligence and mechanical stability principles, offering a scalable framework for heterogeneous aerial systems to collectively handle complex transportation tasks in communication-constrained environments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) effectively promotes collaborative training among distributed clients with privacy considerations in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Despite of data heterogeneity, FL clients may also be constrained by limited energy and availability budgets. Therefore, effective selection of clients participating in training is of vital importance for the convergence of the global model and the balance of client contributions. In this paper, we discuss the performance impact of client availability with time-series data on federated learning. We set up three different scenarios that affect the availability of time-series data and propose FedDeCAB, a novel, semi-decentralized client selection method applying probabilistic rankings of available clients. When a client is disconnected from the server, FedDeCAB allows obtaining partial model parameters from the nearest neighbor clients for joint optimization, improving the performance of offline models and reducing communication overhead. Experiments based on real-world large-scale taxi and vessel trajectory datasets show that FedDeCAB is effective under highly heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic client offline or rejoining.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources and power-electronics interfaces in DC microgrids, coupled with rising cyber threats, necessitates primary controllers that are provably safe, cyber-resilient, and practical. The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources and power-electronics interfaces in DC microgrids, coupled with rising cyber threats, necessitates primary controllers that are provably safe, cyber-resilient, and practical. Conventional droop-based methods remain prevalent due to their simplicity, yet their design is largely empirical and conservative, lacking rigorous guarantees. Advanced strategies improve certain aspects, but often sacrifice scalability, robustness, or formal safety. In this work, we propose a Distributed Safety-Critical Controller (DSCC) that systematically integrates global stabilization with formal safety guarantees in a fully decentralized manner. Leveraging control barrier functions and the port-Hamiltonian system theory, the DSCC achieves scalable safe stabilization while preserving real-time implementability. High-fidelity switched-circuit simulations validate the controller's advantages under various contingencies. This framework paves the way for resilient, safety-critical, and scalable control in next-generation DC microgrids.

<title>Learning to Deliberate: Meta-policy Collaboration for Agentic LLMs with Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03817</link>

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles, making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms. Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

<title>KGBERT4Eth: A Feature-Complete Transformer Powered by Knowledge Graph for Multi-Task Ethereum Fraud Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03860</link>

Abstract: Ethereum's rapid ecosystem expansion and transaction anonymity have triggered a surge in malicious activity. Detection mechanisms currently bifurcate into three technical strands: expert-defined features, graph embeddings, and sequential transaction patterns, collectively spanning the complete feature sets of Ethereum's native data layer. Yet the absence of cross-paradigm integration mechanisms forces practitioners to choose between sacrificing sequential context awareness, structured fund-flow patterns, or human-curated feature insights in their solutions. To bridge this gap, we propose KGBERT4Eth, a feature-complete pre-training encoder that synergistically combines two key components: (1) a Transaction Semantic Extractor, where we train an enhanced Transaction Language Model (TLM) to learn contextual semantic representations from conceptualized transaction records, and (2) a Transaction Knowledge Graph (TKG) that incorporates expert-curated domain knowledge into graph node embeddings to capture fund flow patterns and human-curated feature insights. We jointly optimize pre-training objectives for both components to fuse these complementary features, generating feature-complete embeddings. To emphasize rare anomalous transactions, we design a biased masking prediction task for TLM to focus on statistical outliers, while the Transaction TKG employs link prediction to learn latent transaction relationships and aggregate knowledge. Furthermore, we propose a mask-invariant attention coordination module to ensure stable dynamic information exchange between TLM and TKG during pre-training. KGBERT4Eth significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both phishing account detection and de-anonymization tasks, achieving absolute F1-score improvements of 8-16% on three phishing detection benchmarks and 6-26% on four de-anonymization datasets.

<title>LMAE4Eth: Generalizable and Robust Ethereum Fraud Detection by Exploring Transaction Semantics and Masked Graph Embedding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03939</link>

Abstract: Current Ethereum fraud detection methods rely on context-independent, numerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account transactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings. Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive linguistic representations. To clearly characterize the semantic differences between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training objective together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective, learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning, which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on reconstructing account node features. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising training quality. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our method against 21 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on two of the datasets.

<title>Large Language Models for Cryptocurrency Transaction Analysis: A Bitcoin Case Study</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18158</link>

Abstract: Cryptocurrencies are widely used, yet current methods for analyzing transactions often rely on opaque, black-box models. While these models may achieve high performance, their outputs are usually difficult to interpret and adapt, making it challenging to capture nuanced behavioral patterns. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to address these gaps, but their capabilities in this area remain largely unexplored, particularly in cybercrime detection. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by applying LLMs to real-world cryptocurrency transaction graphs, with a focus on Bitcoin, one of the most studied and widely adopted blockchain networks. We introduce a three-tiered framework to assess LLM capabilities: foundational metrics, characteristic overview, and contextual interpretation. This includes a new, human-readable graph representation format, LLM4TG, and a connectivity-enhanced transaction graph sampling algorithm, CETraS. Together, they significantly reduce token requirements, transforming the analysis of multiple moderately large-scale transaction graphs with LLMs from nearly impossible to feasible under strict token limits. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs have outstanding performance on foundational metrics and characteristic overview, where the accuracy of recognizing most basic information at the node level exceeds 98.50% and the proportion of obtaining meaningful characteristics reaches 95.00%. Regarding contextual interpretation, LLMs also demonstrate strong performance in classification tasks, even with very limited labeled data, where top-3 accuracy reaches 72.43% with explanations. While the explanations are not always fully accurate, they highlight the strong potential of LLMs in this domain. At the same time, several limitations persist, which we discuss along with directions for future research.

<title>Elastic Restaking Networks</title>

Abstract: Many blockchain-based decentralized services require their validators (operators) to deposit stake (collateral), which is forfeited (slashed) if they misbehave. Restaking networks let validators secure multiple services by reusing stake. These networks have quickly gained traction, leveraging over \$20 billion in stake. However, restaking introduces a new attack vector where validators can coordinate to misbehave across multiple services simultaneously, extracting digital assets while forfeiting their stake only once.
  Previous work focused either on preventing coordinated misbehavior or on protecting services if all other services are Byzantine and might unjustly cause slashing due to bugs or malice. The first model overlooks how a single Byzantine service can collapse the network, while the second ignores shared-stake benefits.
  To bridge the gap, we analyze the system as a strategic game of coordinated misbehavior, when a given fraction of the services are Byzantine. We introduce elastic restaking networks, where validators can allocate portions of their stake that may cumulatively exceed their total stake, and when allocations are lost, the remaining stake stretches to cover remaining allocations. We show that elastic networks exhibit superior robustness compared to previous approaches, and demonstrate a synergistic effect where an elastic restaking network enhances its blockchain's security, contrary to community concerns of an opposite effect in existing networks. We then design incentives for tuning validators' allocations.
  Our elastic restaking system and incentive design have immediate practical implications for deployed restaking networks.

Abstract: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching presents a critical challenge, particularly in vast and partially observable environments where real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) coordination in wildlife protection. By modeling hidden environmental factors and inter-agent dynamics through latent variables, our method enhances exploration and coordination under uncertainty.We implement and evaluate our EM-MARL framework using a custom simulation involving 10 UAVs tasked with patrolling protected habitats of the endangered Iranian leopard. Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in detection accuracy, adaptability, and policy convergence when compared to standard algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Our findings underscore the potential of combining EM inference with MARL to improve decentralized decisionmaking in complex, high-stakes conservation scenarios. The full implementation, simulation environment, and training scripts are publicly available on GitHub.

<title>Vision: An Extensible Methodology for Formal Software Verification in Microservice Systems</title>

Abstract: Microservice systems are becoming increasingly adopted due to their scalability, decentralized development, and support for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). However, this decentralized development by separate teams and continuous evolution can introduce miscommunication and incompatible implementations, undermining system maintainability and reliability across aspects from security policy to system architecture. We propose a novel methodology that statically reconstructs microservice source code into a formal system model. From this model, a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) constraint set can be derived, enabling formal verification. Our methodology is extensible, supporting software verification across multiple cross-cutting concerns. We focus on applying the methodology to verify the system architecture concern, presenting formal reasoning to validate the methodology's correctness and applicability for this concern. Additional concerns such as security policy implementation are considered. Future directions are established to extend and evaluate the methodology.

Abstract: The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the simulation-based Expert method.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.03037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethereum smart contracts hold tens of billions of USD in DeFi and NFTs, yet comprehensive security analysis remains difficult due to unverified code, proxy-based architectures, and the reliance on manual inspection of complex execution traces. Existing approaches fall into two main categories: anomaly transaction detection, which flags suspicious transactions but offers limited insight into specific attack strategies hidden in execution traces inside transactions, and code vulnerability detection, which cannot analyze unverified contracts and struggles to show how identified flaws are exploited in real incidents. As a result, analysts must still manually align transaction traces with contract code to reconstruct attack scenarios and conduct forensics. To address this gap, TraceLLM is proposed as a framework that leverages LLMs to integrate execution trace-level detection with decompiled contract code. We introduce a new anomaly execution path identification algorithm and an LLM-refined decompile tool to identify vulnerable functions and provide explicit attack paths to LLM. TraceLLM establishes the first benchmark for joint trace and contract code-driven security analysis. For comparison, proxy baselines are created by jointly transmitting the results of three representative code analysis along with raw traces to LLM. TraceLLM identifies attacker and victim addresses with 85.19\% precision and produces automated reports with 70.37\% factual precision across 27 cases with ground truth expert reports, achieving 25.93\% higher accuracy than the best baseline. Moreover, across 148 real-world Ethereum incidents, TraceLLM automatically generates reports with 66.22\% expert-verified accuracy, demonstrating strong generalizability.

Abstract: We present a decentralized model for autonomous reconfiguration of homogeneous pivoting cube modular robots in two dimensions. Each cube in the ensemble is controlled by a neural network that only gains information from other cubes in its local neighborhood, trained using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, using geometric deep learning, we include the grid symmetries of the cube ensemble in the neural network architecture. We find that even the most localized versions succeed in reconfiguring to the target shape, although reconfiguration happens faster the more information about the whole ensemble is available to individual cubes. Near-optimal reconfiguration is achieved with only nearest neighbor interactions by using multiple information passing between cubes, allowing them to accumulate more global information about the ensemble. Compared to standard neural network architectures, using geometric deep learning approaches provided only minor benefits. Overall, we successfully demonstrate mostly local control of a modular self-assembling system, which is transferable to other space-relevant systems with different action spaces, such as sliding cube modular robots and CubeSat swarms.

<title>HyPV-LEAD: Proactive Early-Warning of Cryptocurrency Anomalies through Data-Driven Structural-Temporal Modeling</title>

Abstract: Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance, temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks. Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits, with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain environments.

Abstract: Determining the optimal block size is crucial for achieving high throughput in blockchain systems. Many studies have focused on tuning various components, such as databases, network bandwidth, and consensus mechanisms. However, the impact of block size on system performance remains a topic of debate, often resulting in divergent views and even leading to new forks in blockchain networks. This research proposes a mathematical model to maximize performance by determining the ideal block size for Hyperledger Fabric, a prominent consortium blockchain. By leveraging machine learning and solving the model with a genetic algorithm, the proposed approach assesses how factors such as block size, transaction size, and network capacity influence the block processing time. The integration of an optimization solver enables precise adjustments to block size configuration before deployment, ensuring improved performance from the outset. This systematic approach aims to balance block processing efficiency, network latency, and system throughput, offering a robust solution to improve blockchain performance across diverse business contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise in tackling complex tasks, but often rely on predefined roles and centralized coordination, limiting their adaptability to evolving challenges. This paper introduces MorphAgent, a novel Autonomous, Self-Organizing, and Self-Adaptive Multi-Agent System for decentralized agent collaboration that enables agents to dynamically evolve their roles and capabilities. Our approach employs self-evolving agent profiles, optimized through three key metrics, guiding agents in refining their individual expertise while maintaining complementary team dynamics. MorphAgent implements a two-phase process: a Profile Update phase for profile optimization, followed by a Task Execution phase where agents continuously adapt their roles based on task feedback. Our experimental results show that MorphAgent outperforms existing frameworks in terms of task performance and adaptability to changing requirements, paving the way for more robust and versatile multi-agent collaborative systems.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has enabled the training of multilingual large language models (LLMs) on diverse and decentralized multilingual data, especially on low-resource languages. To improve client-specific performance, personalization via the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules such as LoRA is common. This involves a personalization strategy (PS), such as the design of the PEFT adapter structures (e.g., in which layers to add LoRAs and what ranks) and choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates) for fine-tuning. Instead of manual PS configuration, we propose FedP$^2$EFT, a federated learning-to-personalize method for multilingual LLMs in cross-device FL settings. Unlike most existing PEFT structure selection methods, which are prone to overfitting low-data regimes, FedP$^2$EFT collaboratively learns the optimal personalized PEFT structure for each client via Bayesian sparse rank selection. Evaluations on both simulated and real-world multilingual FL benchmarks demonstrate that FedP$^2$EFT largely outperforms existing personalized fine-tuning methods, while complementing other existing FL methods.

Abstract: Current AutoML platforms leave substantial performance untapped. Testing 180 fine-tuning tasks across models from 70M to 70B parameters, we found that HuggingFace AutoTrain, TogetherAI, Databricks, and Google Cloud consistently produce suboptimal configurations. Gradients, built on the Bittensor network, attacks this problem through competition. Independent miners race to find optimal hyperparameters, earning rewards proportional to their models' performance. This tournament drives exploration of configuration spaces that single-strategy methods never examine. In our experiments, Gradients achieved a 100\% win rate against TogetherAI, Databricks, and Google Cloud, and beat HuggingFace AutoTrain in 82.8\% of experiments. Mean improvements reached 42.1\% against commercial platforms. Retrieval-augmented generation tasks saw 30-40\% gains; diffusion models improved 23.4\% on person-specific generation. When miners compete for rewards, they develop optimization strategies that centralized approaches overlook. These findings demonstrate that decentralized systems with economic incentives can systematically outperform traditional AutoML, suggesting market dynamics may be key to achieving superior fine-tuning results.

Abstract: As particle accelerators grow in complexity, traditional control methods face increasing challenges in achieving optimal performance. This paper envisions a paradigm shift: a decentralized multi-agent framework for accelerator control, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and distributed among autonomous agents. We present a proposition of a self-improving decentralized system where intelligent agents handle high-level tasks and communication and each agent is specialized to control individual accelerator components.
  This approach raises some questions: What are the future applications of AI in particle accelerators? How can we implement an autonomous complex system such as a particle accelerator where agents gradually improve through experience and human feedback? What are the implications of integrating a human-in-the-loop component for labeling operational data and providing expert guidance? We show three examples, where we demonstrate the viability of such architecture.

<title>BPI: A Novel Efficient and Reliable Search Structure for Hybrid Storage Blockchain</title>

Abstract: Hybrid storage solutions have emerged as potent strategies to alleviate the data storage bottlenecks prevalent in blockchain systems. These solutions harness off-chain Storage Services Providers (SPs) in conjunction with Authenticated Data Structures (ADS) to ensure data integrity and accuracy. Despite these advancements, the reliance on centralized SPs raises concerns about query correctness. Although ADS can verify the existence of individual query results, they fall short of preventing SPs from omitting valid results.
  In this paper, we delineate the fundamental distinctions between data search in blockchains and traditional database systems. Drawing upon these insights, we introduce BPI, a lightweight framework that enables efficient keyword queries and maintenance with low overhead. We propose "Articulated Search", a query pattern specifically designed for blockchain environments that enhances search efficiency while significantly reducing costs during data user updates. Furthermore, BPI employs a suite of validation models to ensure the inclusion of all valid content in search results while maintaining low overhead.
  Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the BPI framework achieves outstanding scalability and performance in keyword searches within blockchain, surpassing EthMB+ and state of the art search databases commonly used in mainstream hybrid storage blockchains (HSB).

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents a robust paradigm for privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning. However, a significant gap persists between the theoretical design of FL algorithms and their practical performance, largely because existing evaluation tools often fail to model realistic operational conditions. Many testbeds oversimplify the critical dynamics among algorithmic efficiency, client-level heterogeneity, and continuously evolving network infrastructure. To address this challenge, we introduce the Federated Learning Emulation and Evaluation Testbed (FLEET). This comprehensive platform provides a scalable and configurable environment by integrating a versatile, framework-agnostic learning component with a high-fidelity network emulator. FLEET supports diverse machine learning frameworks, customizable real-world network topologies, and dynamic background traffic generation. The testbed collects holistic metrics that correlate algorithmic outcomes with detailed network statistics. By unifying the entire experiment configuration, FLEET enables researchers to systematically investigate how network constraints, such as limited bandwidth, high latency, and packet loss, affect the convergence and efficiency of FL algorithms. This work provides the research community with a robust tool to bridge the gap between algorithmic theory and real-world network conditions, promoting the holistic and reproducible evaluation of federated learning systems.

Abstract: Multi-task learning is an effective way to address the challenge of model personalization caused by high data heterogeneity in federated learning. However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning, such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients' behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients. Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients. Our proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the received signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a trust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a Byzantine-free setting.

<title>Detecting Rug Pulls in Decentralized Exchanges: Machine Learning Evidence from the TON Blockchain</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning framework for the early detection of rug pull scams on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) within The Open Network (TON) blockchain. TON's unique architecture, characterized by asynchronous execution and a massive web2 user base from Telegram, presents a novel and critical environment for fraud analysis. We conduct a comprehensive study on the two largest TON DEXs, Ston.Fi and DeDust, fusing data from both platforms to train our models. A key contribution is the implementation and comparative analysis of two distinct rug pull definitions--TVL-based (a catastrophic liquidity withdrawal) and idle-based (a sudden cessation of all trading activity)--within a single, unified study. We demonstrate that Gradient Boosting models can effectively identify rug pulls within the first five minutes of trading, with the TVL-based method achieving superior AUC (up to 0.891) while the idle-based method excels at recall. Our analysis reveals that while feature sets are consistent across exchanges, their underlying distributions differ significantly, challenging straightforward data fusion and highlighting the need for robust, platform-aware models. This work provides a crucial early-warning mechanism for investors and enhances the security infrastructure of the rapidly growing TON DeFi ecosystem.

Abstract: In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.

<title>LiFeChain: Lightweight Blockchain for Secure and Efficient Federated Lifelong Learning in IoT</title>

Abstract: The expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices constantly generates heterogeneous data streams, driving demand for continuous, decentralized intelligence. Federated Lifelong Learning (FLL) provides an ideal solution by incorporating federated and lifelong learning to overcome catastrophic forgetting. The extended lifecycle of FLL in IoT systems increases their vulnerability to persistent attacks, and these risks may be obscured by performance degradation caused by spatial-temporal data heterogeneity. Moreover, this problem is exacerbated by the standard single-server architecture, as its single point of failure makes it difficult to maintain a reliable audit trail for long-term threats. Blockchain provides a tamper-proof foundation for trustworthy FLL systems. Nevertheless, directly applying blockchain to FLL significantly increases computational and retrieval costs with the expansion of the knowledge base, slowing down the training on IoT devices. To address these challenges, we propose LiFeChain, a lightweight blockchain for secure and efficient federated lifelong learning by providing a tamper-resistant ledger with minimal on-chain disclosure and bidirectional verification. To the best of our knowledge, LiFeChain is the first blockchain tailored for FLL. LiFeChain incorporates two complementary mechanisms: the proof-of-model-correlation (PoMC) consensus on the server, which couples learning and unlearning mechanisms to mitigate negative transfer, and segmented zero-knowledge arbitration (Seg-ZA) on the client, which detects and arbitrates abnormal committee behavior without compromising privacy. LiFeChain is designed as a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing FLL algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that LiFeChain not only enhances model performance against two long-term attacks but also sustains high efficiency and scalability.

<title>Semantic Technologies in Practical Demand Response: An Informational Requirement-based Roadmap</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01459</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future grid will be highly complex and decentralized, requiring sophisticated coordination across numerous human and software agents that manage distributed resources such as Demand Response (DR). Realizing this vision demands significant advances in semantic interoperability, which enables scalable and cost-effective automation across heterogeneous systems. While semantic technologies have progressed in commercial building and DR domains, current ontologies have two critical limitations: they are often developed without a formal framework that reflects real-world DR requirements, and proposals for integrating general and application-specific ontologies remain mostly conceptual, lacking formalization or empirical validation.
  In this paper, we address these gaps by applying a formal ontology evaluation/development approach to define the informational requirements (IRs) necessary for semantic interoperability in the area of incentive-based DR for commercial buildings. We identify the IRs associated with each stage of the wholesale incentive-based DR process, focusing on the perspective of building owners. Using these IRs, we evaluate how well existing ontologies (Brick, DELTA, and EFOnt) support the operational needs of DR participation. Our findings reveal substantial misalignments between current ontologies and practical DR requirements. Based on our assessments, we propose a roadmap of necessary extensions and integrations for these ontologies. This work ultimately aims to enhance the interoperability of today's and future smart grid, thereby facilitating scalable integration of DR systems into the grid's complex operational framework.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generalized intelligence, multimodal understanding, and adaptive learning across a wide range of domains. However, their deployment in harsh or austere environments -- characterized by intermittent connectivity, limited computation, noisy data, and dynamically changing network topologies -- remains an open challenge. Existing distributed learning methods such as federated learning (FL) struggle to adapt in such settings due to their reliance on stable infrastructure, synchronized updates, and resource-intensive training. In this work, we explore the potential of Federated Foundation Models (FFMs) as a promising paradigm to address these limitations. By integrating the scalability and generalization power of FMs with novel decentralized, communication-aware FL frameworks, we aim to enable robust, energy-efficient, and adaptive intelligence in extreme and adversarial conditions. We present a detailed breakdown of system-level constraints in harsh environments, and discuss the open research challenges in communication design, model robustness, and energy-efficient personalization for these unique settings.

<title>Fault-Tolerant Decentralized Distributed Asynchronous Federated Learning with Adaptive Termination Detection</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training across distributed clients while ensuring data privacy. Traditionally, FL relies on a centralized server to coordinate learning, which creates bottlenecks and a single point of failure. Decentralized FL architectures eliminate the need for a central server and can operate in either synchronous or asynchronous modes. Synchronous FL requires all clients to compute updates and wait for one another before aggregation, guaranteeing consistency but often suffering from delays due to slower participants. Asynchronous FL addresses this by allowing clients to update independently, offering better scalability and responsiveness in heterogeneous environments.
  Our research develops an asynchronous decentralized FL approach in two progressive phases. (a) In Phase 1, we develop an asynchronous FL framework that enables clients to learn and update independently, removing the need for strict synchronization. (b) In Phase 2, we extend this framework with fault tolerance mechanisms to handle client failures and message drops, ensuring robust performance even under unpredictable conditions. As a central contribution, we propose Client-Confident Convergence and Client-Responsive Termination novel techniques that provide each client with the ability to autonomously determine appropriate termination points. These methods ensure that all active clients conclude meaningfully and efficiently, maintaining reliable convergence despite the challenges of asynchronous communication and faults.

Abstract: A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response applications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in complex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent communication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known as Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing capabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate explicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in maintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing. Recent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the classical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep learning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent swarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric features extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It incorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel, differentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that promotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph Laplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent gathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must gather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing analytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while maintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes. While the analytical solution guarantees cohesion, it is often too slow in practice. In time-critical scenarios, such as emergency response operations where lives are at risk, slower analytical methods are impractical and justify the loss of some agents within the swarm. This paper presents and analyzes this trade-off in detail.

<title>Near-Optimal Stability for Distributed Transaction Processing in Blockchain Sharding</title>

Abstract: In blockchain sharding, $n$ processing nodes are divided into $s$ shards, and each shard processes transactions in parallel. A key challenge in such a system is to ensure system stability for any ``tractable'' pattern of generated transactions; this is modeled by an adversary generating transactions with a certain rate of at most $\rho$ and burstiness $b$. This model captures worst-case scenarios and even some attacks on transactions' processing, e.g., DoS. A stable system ensures bounded transaction queue sizes and bounded transaction latency. It is known that the absolute upper bound on the maximum injection rate for which any scheduler could guarantee bounded queues and latency of transactions is $\max\left\{ \frac{2}{k+1}, \frac{2}{ \left\lfloor\sqrt{2s}\right\rfloor}\right\}$, where $k$ is the maximum number of shards that each transaction accesses. Here, we first provide a single leader scheduler that guarantees stability under injection rate $\rho \leq \max\left\{ \frac{1}{16k}, \frac{1}{16\lceil \sqrt{s} \rceil}\right\}$. Moreover, we also give a distributed scheduler with multiple leaders that guarantees stability under injection rate $\rho \leq \frac{1}{16c_1 \log D \log s}\max\left\{ \frac{1}{k}, \frac{1}{\lceil \sqrt{s} \rceil} \right\}$, where $c_1$ is some positive constant and $D$ is the diameter of shard graph $G_s$. This bound is within a poly-log factor from the optimal injection rate, and significantly improves the best previous known result for the distributed setting by Adhikari et al., SPAA 2024.

Abstract: Learning a world model for model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can significantly improve the sample efficiency by learning policies in imagination. However, building a world model for Multi-Agent RL (MARL) can be particularly challenging due to the scalability issue in a centralized architecture arising from a large number of agents, and also the non-stationarity issue in a decentralized architecture stemming from the inter-dependency among agents. To address both challenges, we propose a novel world model for MARL that learns decentralized local dynamics for scalability, combined with a centralized representation aggregation from all agents. We cast the dynamics learning as an auto-regressive sequence modeling problem over discrete tokens by leveraging the expressive Transformer architecture, in order to model complex local dynamics across different agents and provide accurate and consistent long-term imaginations. As the first pioneering Transformer-based world model for multi-agent systems, we introduce a Perceiver Transformer as an effective solution to enable centralized representation aggregation within this context. Results on Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) show that it outperforms strong model-free approaches and existing model-based methods in both sample efficiency and overall performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a lightweight systematic solution for multi-robot coordinated navigation with decentralized cooperative perception. An information flow is first created to facilitate real-time observation sharing over unreliable ad-hoc networks. Then, the environmental uncertainties of each robot are reduced by interaction fields that deliver complementary information. Finally, path optimization is achieved, enabling self-organized coordination with effective convergence, divergence, and collision avoidance. Our method is fully interpretable and ready for deployment without gaps. Comprehensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate reduced path redundancy, robust performance across various tasks, and minimal demands on computation and communication.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) encounters scalability challenges when implemented over fog networks that do not follow FL's conventional star topology architecture. Semi-decentralized FL (SD-FL) has proposed a solution for device-to-device (D2D) enabled networks that divides model cooperation into two stages: at the lower stage, D2D communications is employed for local model aggregations within subnetworks (subnets), while the upper stage handles device-server (DS) communications for global model aggregations. However, existing SD-FL schemes are based on gradient diversity assumptions that become performance bottlenecks as data distributions become more heterogeneous. In this work, we develop semi-decentralized gradient tracking (SD-GT), the first SD-FL methodology that removes the need for such assumptions by incorporating tracking terms into device updates for each communication layer. Our analytical characterization of SD-GT reveals upper bounds on convergence for non-convex, convex, and strongly-convex problems. We show how the bounds enable the development of an optimization algorithm that navigates the performance-efficiency trade-off by tuning subnet sampling rate and D2D rounds for each global training interval. Our subsequent numerical evaluations demonstrate that SD-GT obtains substantial improvements in trained model quality and communication cost relative to baselines in SD-FL and gradient tracking on several datasets.

Abstract: Federated learning has recently gained popularity as a framework for distributed clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model using local data. While traditional federated learning relies on a central server for model aggregation, recent advancements adopt a decentralized framework, enabling direct model exchange between clients and eliminating the single point of failure. However, existing decentralized frameworks often assume all clients train a shared model. Personalizing each client's model can enhance performance, especially with heterogeneous client data distributions. We propose FedSPD, an efficient personalized federated learning algorithm for the decentralized setting, and show that it learns accurate models even in low-connectivity networks. To provide theoretical guarantees on convergence, we introduce a clustering-based framework that enables consensus on models for distinct data clusters while personalizing to unique mixtures of these clusters at different clients. This flexibility, allowing selective model updates based on data distribution, substantially reduces communication costs compared to prior work on personalized federated learning in decentralized settings. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that FedSPD outperforms multiple decentralized variants of personalized federated learning algorithms, especially in scenarios with low-connectivity networks.

Abstract: The detection of vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a significant challenge. While numerous tools are available for analyzing smart contracts in source code, only about 1.79% of smart contracts on Ethereum are open-source. For existing tools that target bytecodes, most of them only consider the semantic logic context and disregard function interface information in the bytecodes. In this paper, we propose COBRA, a novel framework that integrates semantic context and function interfaces to detect vulnerabilities in bytecodes of the smart contract. To our best knowledge, COBRA is the first framework that combines these two features. Moreover, to infer the function signatures that are not present in signature databases, we propose SRIF, automatically learn the rules of function signatures from the smart contract bytecodes. The bytecodes associated with the function signatures are collected by constructing a control flow graph (CFG) for the SRIF training. We optimize the semantic context using the operation code in the static single assignment (SSA) format. Finally, we integrate the context and function interface representations in the latent space as the contract feature embedding. The contract features in the hidden space are decoded for vulnerability classifications with a decoder and attention module. Experimental results demonstrate that SRIF can achieve 94.76% F1-score for function signature inference. Furthermore, when the ground truth ABI exists, COBRA achieves 93.45% F1-score for vulnerability classification. In the absence of ABI, the inferred function feature fills the encoder, and the system accomplishes an 89.46% recall rate.

<title>A Trust-Centric Approach To Quantifying Maturity and Security in Internet Voting Protocols</title>

Abstract: Voting is a cornerstone of collective participatory decision-making in contexts ranging from political elections to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Despite the proliferation of internet voting protocols promising enhanced accessibility and efficiency, their evaluation and comparison are complicated by a lack of standardized criteria and unified definitions of security and maturity. Furthermore, socio-technical requirements by decision makers are not structurally taken into consideration when comparing internet voting systems. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a trust-centric maturity scoring framework to quantify the security and maturity of seventeen internet voting systems. A comprehensive trust model analysis is conducted for selected internet voting protocols, examining their security properties, trust assumptions, technical complexity, and practical usability. In this paper we propose the Internet Voting Maturity Framework (IVMF) which supports nuanced assessment that reflects real-world deployment concerns and aids decision-makers in selecting appropriate systems tailored to their specific use-case requirements. The framework is general enough to be applied to other systems, where the aspects of decentralization, trust, and security are crucial, such as digital identity, Ethereum layer-two scaling solutions, and federated data infrastructures. Its objective is to provide an extendable toolkit for policy makers and technology experts alike that normalizes technical and non-technical requirements on a univariate scale.

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in research and development on open-source and cost-efficient large-language models (LLMs), serving scalability remains a critical challenge, particularly for small organizations and individuals seeking to deploy and test their LLM innovations. Inspired by peer-to-peer networks that leverage decentralized overlay nodes to increase throughput and availability, we propose GenTorrent, an LLM serving overlay that harnesses computing resources from decentralized contributors. We identify four key research problems inherent to enabling such a decentralized infrastructure: 1) overlay network organization; 2) LLM communication privacy; 3) overlay forwarding for resource efficiency; and 4) verification of serving quality. This work presents the first systematic study of these fundamental problems in the context of decentralized LLM serving. Evaluation results from a prototype implemented on a set of decentralized nodes demonstrate that GenTorrent achieves a latency reduction of over 50% compared to the baseline design without overlay forwarding. Furthermore, the security features introduce minimal overhead to serving latency and throughput. We believe this work pioneers a new direction for democratizing and scaling future AI serving capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce the Graded Transformer framework, a new class of sequence models that embeds algebraic inductive biases through grading transformations on vector spaces. Extending Graded Neural Networks (GNNs), we propose two architectures: the Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and the Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT). These models apply parameterized scaling operators, governed by fixed or learnable grading tuples and in the case of EGT exponential factors, to encode hierarchical structure in attention and representation layers and to improve efficiency for structured data.
  We establish rigorous guarantees, including universal approximation theorems for continuous and Sobolev functions, reduced sample complexity via effective VC dimension bounds, Lipschitz continuity of graded operations, and robustness to perturbations. A graded loss ensures gradient stability and alignment with domain priors during optimization. By treating grades as differentiable parameters, the framework enables adaptive feature prioritization, overcoming limitations of fixed grades in earlier models.
  The Graded Transformer provides a mathematically principled approach to hierarchical learning and neuro-symbolic reasoning. Applications include algebraic geometry (moduli spaces and zeta functions), physics (multiscale systems), natural language processing (syntactic parsing), biological sequence analysis (variant prediction), robotics and autonomous systems (safety-critical prioritization), the automotive industry (certifiable AI for ADAS), and blockchain and financial cryptography (secure coding and structured prediction).

<title>Decentralized Federated Averaging via Random Walk</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a communication-efficient distributed machine learning method that allows multiple devices to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. FL can be categorized into centralized and decentralized paradigms. The centralized paradigm relies on a central server to aggregate local models, potentially resulting in single points of failure, communication bottlenecks, and exposure of model parameters. In contrast, the decentralized paradigm, which does not require a central server, provides improved robustness and privacy. The essence of federated learning lies in leveraging multiple local updates for efficient communication. However, this approach may result in slower convergence or even convergence to suboptimal models in the presence of heterogeneous and imbalanced data. To address this challenge, we study decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW), which replaces multiple local update steps on a single device with random walk updates. Traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and its decentralized versions commonly ignore stragglers, which reduces the amount of training data and introduces sampling bias. Therefore, we allow DFedRW to aggregate partial random walk updates, ensuring that each computation contributes to the model update. To further improve communication efficiency, we also propose a quantized version of DFedRW. We demonstrate that (quantized) DFedRW achieves convergence upper bound of order $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{k^{1-q}})$ under convex conditions. Furthermore, we propose a sufficient condition that reveals when quantization balances communication and convergence. Numerical analysis indicates that our proposed algorithms outperform (decentralized) FedAvg in both convergence rate and accuracy, achieving a 38.3\% and 37.5\% increase in test accuracy under high levels of heterogeneities.

Abstract: Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services have become a primary gateway for users to access public blockchains. While they offer significant convenience, RPC services also introduce critical privacy challenges that remain insufficiently examined. Existing deanonymization attacks either do not apply to blockchain RPC users or incur costs like transaction fees assuming an active network eavesdropper. In this paper, we propose a novel deanonymization attack that can link an IP address of a RPC user to this user's blockchain pseudonym. Our analysis reveals a temporal correlation between the timestamps of transaction confirmations recorded on the public ledger and those of TCP packets sent by the victim when querying transaction status. We assume a strong passive adversary with access to network infrastructure, capable of monitoring traffic at network border routers or Internet exchange points. By monitoring network traffic and analyzing public ledgers, the attacker can link the IP address of the TCP packet to the pseudonym of the transaction initiator by exploiting the temporal correlation. This deanonymization attack incurs zero transaction fee. We mathematically model and analyze the attack method, perform large-scale measurements of blockchain ledgers, and conduct real-world attacks to validate the attack. Our attack achieves a high success rate of over 95% against normal RPC users on various blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Bitcoin and Solana.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset, we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide future method development.

Abstract: The evolution of blockchain technology, from its origins as a decentralized ledger for cryptocurrencies to its broader applications in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), has significantly transformed financial ecosystems while introducing new challenges such as Maximum Extractable Value (MEV). This paper explores MEV on the Polygon blockchain, with a particular focus on Atomic Arbitrage (AA) transactions. We establish criteria for identifying AA transactions and analyze key factors such as searcher behavior, bidding dynamics, and token usage. Utilizing a dataset spanning 22 months and covering 23 million blocks, we examine MEV dynamics with a focus on Spam-based and Auction-based backrunning strategies. Our findings reveal that while Spam-based transactions are more prevalent, Auction-based transactions demonstrate greater profitability. Through detailed examples and analysis, we investigate the interactions between network architecture, transaction sequencing, and MEV extraction, offering comprehensive insights into the evolution and challenges of MEV in decentralized ecosystems. These results emphasize the need for robust transaction ordering mechanisms and highlight the implications of emerging MEV strategies for blockchain networks.

<title>Towards a Decentralized IoT Onboarding for Smart Homes Using Consortium Blockchain</title>

Abstract: The increasing adoption of smart home devices and IoT-based security systems presents significant opportunities to enhance convenience, safety, and risk management for homeowners and service providers. However, secure onboarding-provisioning credentials and establishing trust with cloud platforms-remains a considerable challenge. Traditional onboarding methods often rely on centralized Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) models and manufacturer-controlled keys, which introduce security risks and limit the user's digital sovereignty. These limitations hinder the widespread deployment of scalable IoT solutions. This paper presents a novel onboarding framework that builds upon existing network-layer onboarding techniques and extends them to the application layer to address these challenges. By integrating consortium blockchain technology, we propose a decentralized onboarding mechanism that enhances transparency, security, and monitoring for smart home architectures. The architecture supports device registration, key revocation, access control management, and risk detection through event-driven alerts across dedicated blockchain channels and smart contracts. To evaluate the framework, we formally model the protocol using the Tamarin Prover under the Dolev-Yao adversary model. The analysis focuses on authentication, token integrity, key confidentiality, and resilience over public channels. A prototype implementation demonstrates the system's viability in smart home settings, with verification completing in 0.34 seconds, highlighting its scalability and suitability for constrained devices and diverse stakeholders. Additionally, performance evaluation shows that the blockchain-based approach effectively handles varying workloads, maintains high throughput and low latency, and supports near real-time IoT data processing.

Abstract: Digital payments play a pivotal role in the burgeoning digital economy. Moving forward, the enhancement of digital payment systems necessitates programmability, going beyond just efficiency and convenience, to meet the evolving needs and complexities. Smart contract platforms like Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) networks and blockchains support programmable digital payments. However, the prevailing paradigm of programming payment logics involves coding smart contracts with programming languages, leading to high costs and significant security challenges. A novel and versatile method for payment programming on DLTs was presented in this paper - transforming digital currencies into token streams, then pipelining smart contracts to authorize, aggregate, lock, direct, and dispatch these streams efficiently from source to target accounts. By utilizing a small set of configurable templates, a few specialized smart contracts could be generated, and support most of payment logics through configuring and composing them. This approach could substantially reduce the cost of payment programming and enhance security, self-enforcement, adaptability, and controllability, thus hold the potential to become an essential component in the infrastructure of digital economy.

Abstract: The Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) market is revolutionizing the sharing economy through token-based economics and smart contracts that govern decentralized operations. By 2024, DePIN projects have exceeded \$10 billion in market capitalization, underscoring their rapid growth. However, the unregulated nature of these markets, coupled with the autonomous deployment of AI agents in smart contracts, introduces risks such as inefficiencies and potential misalignment with human values. To address these concerns, we introduce EconAgentic, a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered framework designed to mitigate these challenges. Our research focuses on three key areas: 1) modeling the dynamic evolution of DePIN markets, 2) evaluating stakeholders' actions and their economic impacts, and 3) analyzing macroeconomic indicators to align market outcomes with societal goals. Through EconAgentic, we simulate how AI agents respond to token incentives, invest in infrastructure, and adapt to market conditions, comparing AI-driven decisions with human heuristic benchmarks. Our results show that EconAgentic provides valuable insights into the efficiency, inclusion, and stability of DePIN markets, contributing to both academic understanding and practical improvements in the design and governance of decentralized, tokenized economies.

Abstract: Much of federated learning (FL) focuses on settings where local dataset statistics remain the same between training and testing. However, this assumption often does not hold in practice due to distribution shifts, motivating the development of domain generalization (DG) approaches that leverage source domain data to train models capable of generalizing to unseen target domains. In this paper, we are motivated by two major gaps in existing work on FL and DG: (1) the lack of formal mathematical analysis of DG objectives; and (2) DG research in FL being limited to the star-topology architecture. We develop Decentralized Federated Domain Generalization with Style Sharing ($\textit{StyleDDG}$), a decentralized DG algorithm which allows devices in a peer-to-peer network to achieve DG based on sharing style information inferred from their datasets. Additionally, we provide the first systematic approach to analyzing style-based DG training in decentralized networks. We cast existing centralized DG algorithms within our framework, and employ their formalisms to model $\textit{StyleDDG}$. We then obtain analytical conditions under which convergence of $\textit{StyleDDG}$ can be guaranteed. Through experiments on popular DG datasets, we demonstrate that $\textit{StyleDDG}$ can obtain significant improvements in accuracy across target domains with minimal communication overhead compared to baseline decentralized gradient methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent service optimization method based on a multi-agent collaborative evolution mechanism to address governance challenges in large-scale microservice architectures. These challenges include complex service dependencies, dynamic topology structures, and fluctuating workloads. The method models each service as an agent and introduces graph representation learning to construct a service dependency graph. This enables agents to perceive and embed structural changes within the system. Each agent learns its policy based on a Markov Decision Process. A centralized training and decentralized execution framework is used to integrate local autonomy with global coordination. To enhance overall system performance and adaptability, a game-driven policy optimization mechanism is designed. Through a selection-mutation process, agent strategy distributions are dynamically adjusted. This supports adaptive collaboration and behavioral evolution among services. Under this mechanism, the system can quickly respond and achieve stable policy convergence when facing scenarios such as sudden workload spikes, topology reconfigurations, or resource conflicts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a representative microservice simulation platform. Comparative analyses are performed against several advanced approaches, focusing on coordination efficiency, adaptability, and policy convergence performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms others in several key metrics. It significantly improves governance efficiency and operational stability in large-scale microservice systems. The method demonstrates strong practical value and engineering feasibility.

<title>BridgeShield: Enhancing Security for Cross-chain Bridge Applications via Heterogeneous Graph Mining</title>

Abstract: Cross-chain bridges play a vital role in enabling blockchain interoperability. However, due to the inherent design flaws and the enormous value they hold, they have become prime targets for hacker attacks. Existing detection methods show progress yet remain limited, as they mainly address single-chain behaviors and fail to capture cross-chain semantics. To address this gap, we leverage heterogeneous graph attention networks, which are well-suited for modeling multi-typed entities and relations, to capture the complex execution semantics of cross-chain behaviors. We propose BridgeShield, a detection framework that jointly models the source chain, off-chain coordination, and destination chain within a unified heterogeneous graph representation. BridgeShield incorporates intra-meta-path attention to learn fine-grained dependencies within cross-chain paths and inter-meta-path attention to highlight discriminative cross-chain patterns, thereby enabling precise identification of attack behaviors. Extensive experiments on 51 real-world cross-chain attack events demonstrate that BridgeShield achieves an average F1-score of 92.58%, representing a 24.39% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate the effectiveness of BridgeShield as a practical solution for securing cross-chain bridges and enhancing the resilience of multi-chain ecosystems.

Abstract: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges such as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This paper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using digital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator motions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual feedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled into two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both performance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which dynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates the framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it reduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene representation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11, SSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298. These results show the framework's capability to ensure spatial precision and visual fidelity in real-time, high-risk industrial environments.

Abstract: Operating nodes in an L1 blockchain remains costly despite recent advances in blockchain technology. One of the most resource-intensive components of a node is the blockchain database, also known as StateDB, that manages balances, nonce, code, and the persistent storage of accounts/smart contracts. Although the blockchain industry has transitioned from forking to forkless chains due to improved consensus protocols, forkless blockchains still rely on legacy forking databases that are suboptimal for their purposes. In this paper, we propose a forkless blockchain database, showing a 100x improvement in storage and a 10x improvement in throughput compared to the geth-based Fantom Blockchain client.

Abstract: Collaborative learning enhances the performance and adaptability of multi-robot systems in complex tasks but faces significant challenges due to high communication overhead and data heterogeneity inherent in multi-robot tasks. To this end, we propose CoCoL, a Communication efficient decentralized Collaborative Learning method tailored for multi-robot systems with heterogeneous local datasets. Leveraging a mirror descent framework, CoCoL achieves remarkable communication efficiency with approximate Newton-type updates by capturing the similarity between objective functions of robots, and reduces computational costs through inexact sub-problem solutions. Furthermore, the integration of a gradient tracking scheme ensures its robustness against data heterogeneity. Experimental results on three representative multi robot collaborative learning tasks show the superiority of the proposed CoCoL in significantly reducing both the number of communication rounds and total bandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. These benefits are particularly evident in challenging scenarios involving non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data distribution, streaming data, and time-varying network topologies.

Abstract: The use of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) systems for digital identity management is gaining traction and interest. Countries such as Bhutan have already implemented an SSI infrastructure to manage the identity of their citizens. The EU, thanks to the revised eIDAS regulation, is opening the door for SSI vendors to develop SSI systems for the planned EU digital identity wallet. These developments, which fall within the sovereign domain, raise questions about individual privacy. The design of SSI systems is complex, often characterized by a large number of components and architectural choices because the current SSI communities differ on how to create identifiers, how to build and present credentials, and even how to design a user wallet. SSI stacks developed by different organizations provide different privacy features for different privacy needs. This paper performs a systematic mapping and review of SSI components and technologies into a novel four-layer privacy framework to address the design complexity of SSI systems. Based on this review, we provide an accompanying Design Assistance Dashboard (DAD). The DAD shows the interdependencies between SSI components in different layers, and maps these components to different privacy requirements and considerations, even providing a simple privacy class for each component.

Abstract: Distributed Key Generation (DKG) is vital to threshold-based cryptographic protocols such as threshold signatures, secure multiparty computation, and i-voting. Yet, standard $(n,t)$-DKG requires a known set of $n$ participants and a fixed threshold $t$, making it impractical for public or decentralized settings where membership and availability can change.
  We introduce Federated Distributed Key Generation (FDKG), which relaxes these constraints by allowing each participant to select its own guardian set, with a local threshold to reconstruct that participant's partial key. FDKG generalizes DKG and draws inspiration from Federated Byzantine Agreement, enabling dynamic trust delegation with minimal message complexity (two rounds). The protocol's liveness can tolerate adversary that controls up to $k - t + 1$ nodes in every guardian set. The paper presents a detailed protocol, a formal description of liveness, privacy, and integrity properties, and a simulation-based evaluation showcasing the efficacy of FDKG in mitigating node unreliability.
  In a setting of 100 parties, a 50% participation rate, 80% retention, and 40 guardians, the distribution phase incurred a total message size of 332.7 kB ($O(n\,k)$), and reconstruction phase 416.56 kB ($O(n\,k)$. Groth16 client-side proving took about 5 s in the distribution phase and ranged from 0.619 s up to 29.619 s in the reconstruction phase.
  Our work advances distributed cryptography by enabling flexible trust models for dynamic networks, with applications ranging from ad-hoc collaboration to blockchain governance.

Abstract: The nnU-Net framework has played a crucial role in medical image segmentation and has become the gold standard in multitudes of applications targeting different diseases, organs, and modalities. However, so far it has been used primarily in a centralized approach where the collected data is stored in the same location where nnU-Net is trained. This centralized approach has various limitations, such as potential leakage of sensitive patient information and violation of patient privacy. Federated learning has emerged as a key approach for training segmentation models in a decentralized manner, enabling collaborative development while prioritising patient privacy. In this paper, we propose FednnU-Net, a plug-and-play, federated learning extension of the nnU-Net framework. To this end, we contribute two federated methodologies to unlock decentralized training of nnU-Net, namely, Federated Fingerprint Extraction (FFE) and Asymmetric Federated Averaging (AsymFedAvg). We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments demonstrating high and consistent performance of our methods for breast, cardiac and fetal segmentation based on a multi-modal collection of 6 datasets representing samples from 18 different institutions. To democratize research as well as real-world deployments of decentralized training in clinical centres, we publicly share our framework at https://github.com/faildeny/FednnUNet .

However, existing methods adopt the centralized training, ignoring the potential privacy concerns as the data is distributed across multiple devices or entities in reality. In this paper, we propose L2RW+, a benchmark that brings VI-ReID closer to real-world applications. The core rationale behind L2RW+ is that incorporating decentralized training into VI-ReID can address privacy concerns in scenarios with limited data-sharing constrains. Specifically, we design protocols and corresponding algorithms for different privacy sensitivity levels. In our new benchmark, we simulate the training under real-world data conditions that: 1) data from each camera is completely isolated, or 2) different data entities (e.g., data controllers of a certain region) can selectively share the data. In this way, we simulate scenarios with strict privacy restrictions, which is closer to real-world conditions. Comprehensive experiments show the feasibility and potential of decentralized VI-ReID training at both image and video levels. In particular, with increasing data scales, the performance gap between decentralized and centralized training decreases, especially in video-level VI-ReID. In unseen domains, decentralized training even achieves performance comparable to SOTA centralized methods. This work offers a novel research entry for deploying VI-ReID into real-world scenarios and can benefit the community. Code is available at: https://github.com/Joey623/L2RW.

Abstract: Automated Market Maker (AMM)-based Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) are crucial in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), but Ethereum implementations suffer from high transaction costs and price synchronization challenges. To address these limitations, we compare the XRP Ledger (XRPL)-AMM-Decentralized Exchange (DEX), a protocol-level implementation, against a Generic AMM-based DEX (G-AMM-DEX) on Ethereum, akin to Uniswap's V2 AMM implementation, through agent-based simulations using real market data and multiple volatility scenarios generated via Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). Results demonstrate that the XRPL-AMM-DEX achieves superior price synchronization, reduced slippage, and improved returns due to XRPL's lower fees and shorter block times, with benefits amplifying during market volatility. The integrated Continuous Auction Mechanism (CAM) further mitigates impermanent loss by redistributing arbitrage value to Liquidity Providers (LPs). To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first comparative analysis between protocol-level and smart contract AMM-based DEX implementations and the first agent-based simulation validating theoretical auction mechanisms for AMM-based DEXs.

Abstract: Algorand is a scalable and secure permissionless blockchain that achieves proof-of-stake consensus via cryptographic self-sortition and binary Byzantine agreement. In this paper, we present a process algebraic model of the Algorand consensus protocol with the aim of enabling rigorous formal verification. Our model captures the behavior of participants with respect to the structured alternation of consensus steps toward a committee-based agreement by means of a probabilistic process calculus. We validate the correctness of the protocol in the absence of adversaries and then extend our model to capture the influence of coordinated malicious nodes that can force the commit of an empty block instead of the proposed one. The adversarial scenario is analyzed by using an equivalence-checking-based noninterference framework that we have implemented in the CADP verification toolkit. In addition to highlighting both the robustness and the limitations of the Algorand protocol under adversarial assumptions, this work illustrates the added value of using formal methods for the analysis of blockchain consensus algorithms.

<title>Divide, Weight, and Route: Difficulty-Aware Optimization with Dynamic Expert Fusion for Long-tailed Recognition</title>

Abstract: Long-tailed visual recognition is challenging not only due to class imbalance but also because of varying classification difficulty across categories. Simply reweighting classes by frequency often overlooks those that are intrinsically hard to learn. To address this, we propose \textbf{DQRoute}, a modular framework that combines difficulty-aware optimization with dynamic expert collaboration. DQRoute first estimates class-wise difficulty based on prediction uncertainty and historical performance, and uses this signal to guide training with adaptive loss weighting. On the architectural side, DQRoute employs a mixture-of-experts design, where each expert specializes in a different region of the class distribution. At inference time, expert predictions are weighted by confidence scores derived from expert-specific OOD detectors, enabling input-adaptive routing without the need for a centralized router. All components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on standard long-tailed benchmarks demonstrate that DQRoute significantly improves performance, particularly on rare and difficult classes, highlighting the benefit of integrating difficulty modeling with decentralized expert routing.

<title>Secure Multi-LLM Agentic AI and Agentification for Edge General Intelligence by Zero-Trust: A Survey</title>

Abstract: Agentification serves as a critical enabler of Edge General Intelligence (EGI), transforming massive edge devices into cognitive agents through integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and perception, reasoning, and acting modules. These agents collaborate across heterogeneous edge infrastructures, forming multi-LLM agentic AI systems that leverage collective intelligence and specialized capabilities to tackle complex, multi-step tasks. However, the collaborative nature of multi-LLM systems introduces critical security vulnerabilities, including insecure inter-LLM communications, expanded attack surfaces, and cross-domain data leakage that traditional perimeter-based security cannot adequately address. To this end, this survey introduces zero-trust security of multi-LLM in EGI, a paradigmatic shift following the ``never trust, always verify'' principle. We begin by systematically analyzing the security risks in multi-LLM systems within EGI contexts. Subsequently, we present the vision of a zero-trust multi-LLM framework in EGI. We then survey key technical progress to facilitate zero-trust multi-LLM systems in EGI. Particularly, we categorize zero-trust security mechanisms into model- and system-level approaches. The former and latter include strong identification, context-aware access control, etc., and proactive maintenance, blockchain-based management, etc., respectively. Finally, we identify critical research directions. This survey serves as the first systematic treatment of zero-trust applied to multi-LLM systems, providing both theoretical foundations and practical strategies.

Abstract: Most existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent frameworks rely on centralized orchestration, incurring high deployment costs, rigid communication topologies, and limited adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce Symphony, a decentralized multi-agent system which enables lightweight LLMs on consumer-grade GPUs to coordinate. Symphony introduces three key mechanisms: (1) a decentralized ledger that records capabilities, (2) a Beacon-selection protocol for dynamic task allocation, and (3) weighted result voting based on CoTs. This design forms a privacy-saving, scalable, and fault-tolerant orchestration with low overhead. Empirically, Symphony outperforms existing baselines on reasoning benchmarks, achieving substantial accuracy gains and demonstrating robustness across models of varying capacities.

Abstract: Malicious intent in smart contract development can lead to substantial economic losses. SmartIntentNN is a deep learning model specifically designed to identify unsafe intents in smart contracts. This model integrates the Universal Sentence Encoder, a K-means clustering-based intent highlighting mechanism, and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network for multi-label classification, achieving an F1 of 0.8633 in distinguishing ten different intent categories. In this study, we present an upgraded version of this model, SmartIntentNN2 (Smart Contract Intent Neural Network V2). A significant enhancement in V2 is the incorporation of a BERT-based pre-trained language model, which has been trained on a dataset of 16,000 real smart contracts using a Masked Language Modeling objective. SmartIntentNN2 retains the BiLSTM-based multi-label classification network. With an improved F1 of 0.927, V2 demonstrates enhanced performance compared to its predecessor, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art model for smart contract intent detection.

Abstract: Cooperative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (C-SLAM) enables multiple agents to work together in mapping unknown environments while simultaneously estimating their own positions. This approach enhances robustness, scalability, and accuracy by sharing information between agents, reducing drift, and enabling collective exploration of larger areas. In this paper, we present Decentralized Visual Monocular SLAM (DVM-SLAM), the first open-source decentralized monocular C-SLAM system. By only utilizing low-cost and light-weight monocular vision sensors, our system is well suited for small robots and micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). DVM-SLAM's real-world applicability is validated on physical robots with a custom collision avoidance framework, showcasing its potential in real-time multi-agent autonomous navigation scenarios. We also demonstrate comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art centralized monocular C-SLAM systems. We open-source our code and provide supplementary material online.

Abstract: In a multi robot system establishing trust amongst untrusted robots from different organisations while preserving a robot's privacy is a challenge. Recently decentralized technologies such as smart contract and blockchain are being explored for applications in robotics. However, the limited transaction processing and high maintenance cost hinder the widespread adoption of such approaches. Moreover, blockchain transactions be they on public or private permissioned blockchain are publically readable which further fails to preserve the confidentiality of the robot's data and privacy of the robot. In this work, we propose RoboComm a Decentralized Identity based approach for privacy-preserving interaction between robots. With DID a component of Self-Sovereign Identity; robots can authenticate each other independently without relying on any third-party service. Verifiable Credentials enable private data associated with a robot to be stored within the robot's hardware, unlike existing blockchain based approaches where the data has to be on the blockchain. We improve throughput by allowing message exchange over state channels. Being a blockchain backed solution RoboComm provides a trustworthy system without relying on a single party. Moreover, we implement our proposed approach to demonstrate the feasibility of our solution.

<title>Enhancing Model Privacy in Federated Learning with Random Masking and Quantization</title>

Abstract: The primary goal of traditional federated learning is to protect data privacy by enabling distributed edge devices to collaboratively train a shared global model while keeping raw data decentralized at local clients. The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new challenges in distributed systems, as their substantial computational requirements and the need for specialized expertise raise critical concerns about protecting intellectual property (IP). This highlights the need for a federated learning approach that can safeguard both sensitive data and proprietary models. To tackle this challenge, we propose FedQSN, a federated learning approach that leverages random masking to obscure a subnetwork of model parameters and applies quantization to the remaining parameters. Consequently, the server transmits only a privacy-preserving proxy of the global model to clients during each communication round, thus enhancing the model's confidentiality. Experimental results across various models and tasks demonstrate that our approach not only maintains strong model performance in federated learning settings but also achieves enhanced protection of model parameters compared to baseline methods.

<title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Framework for Risk-Based Adaptive Authentication</title>

Abstract: Balancing robust security with strong privacy guarantees is critical for Risk-Based Adaptive Authentication (RBA), particularly in decentralized settings. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution by enabling collaborative risk assessment without centralizing user data. However, existing FL approaches struggle with Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) user features, resulting in biased, unstable, and poorly generalized global models. This paper introduces FL-RBA2, a novel Federated Learning framework for Risk-Based Adaptive Authentication that addresses Non-IID challenges through a mathematically grounded similarity transformation. By converting heterogeneous user features (including behavioral, biometric, contextual, interaction-based, and knowledge-based modalities) into IID similarity vectors, FL-RBA2 supports unbiased aggregation and personalized risk modeling across distributed clients. The framework mitigates cold-start limitations via clustering-based risk labeling, incorporates Differential Privacy (DP) to safeguard sensitive information, and employs Message Authentication Codes (MACs) to ensure model integrity and authenticity. Federated updates are securely aggregated into a global model, achieving strong balance between user privacy, scalability, and adaptive authentication robustness. Rigorous game-based security proofs in the Random Oracle Model formally establish privacy, correctness, and adaptive security guarantees. Extensive experiments on keystroke, mouse, and contextual datasets validate FL-RBA2's effectiveness in high-risk user detection and its resilience to model inversion and inference attacks, even under strong DP constraints.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is becoming central to modern distribution systems as rooftop PV and home energy management systems become pervasive, yet most existing market and reinforcement learning designs emphasize efficiency or private profit and offer little real-time guidance to ensure equitable outcomes under uncertainty. To address this gap, a fairness-aware multiagent reinforcement learning framework, FairMarket-RL, is proposed in which a large language model (LLM) critic shapes bidding policies within a continuous double auction under partial observability and discrete price-quantity actions. After each trading slot, the LLM returns normalized fairness scores Fairness-to-Grid (FTG), Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS), and Fairness-of-Pricing (FPP) that are integrated into the reward via ramped coefficients and tunable scaling, so that fairness guidance complements, rather than overwhelms, economic incentives. The environment models realistic residential load and PV profiles and enforce hard constraints on prices, physical feasibility, and policy-update stability. Across a progression of experiments from a small pilot to a larger simulated community and a mixed-asset real-world dataset, the framework shifts exchanges toward local P2P trades, lowers consumer costs relative to grid-only procurement, sustains strong fairness across participants, and preserves utility viability. Sensitivity analyses over solar availability and aggregate demand further indicate robust performance, suggesting a scalable, LLM-guided pathway to decentralized electricity markets that are economically efficient, socially equitable, and technically sound.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) has catalyzed the evolution from centralized cloud intelligence towards decentralized edge general intelligence. However, traditional edge intelligence methods, characterized by static models and limited cognitive autonomy, fail to address the dynamic, heterogeneous, and resource-constrained scenarios inherent to emerging edge networks. Agentic artificial intelligence (Agentic AI) emerges as a transformative solution, enabling edge systems to autonomously perceive multimodal environments, reason contextually, and adapt proactively through continuous perception-reasoning-action loops. In this context, the agentification of edge intelligence serves as a key paradigm shift, where distributed entities evolve into autonomous agents capable of collaboration and continual adaptation. This paper presents a comprehensive survey dedicated to Agentic AI and agentification frameworks tailored explicitly for edge general intelligence. First, we systematically introduce foundational concepts and clarify distinctions from traditional edge intelligence paradigms. Second, we analyze important enabling technologies, including compact model compression, energy-aware computing strategies, robust connectivity frameworks, and advanced knowledge representation and reasoning mechanisms. Third, we provide representative case studies demonstrating Agentic AI's capabilities in low-altitude economy networks, intent-driven networking, vehicular networks, and human-centric service provisioning, supported by numerical evaluations. Furthermore, we identify current research challenges, review emerging open-source platforms, and highlight promising future research directions to guide robust, scalable, and trustworthy Agentic AI deployments for next-generation edge environments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a powerful technique for training Machine Learning (ML) models in a decentralized manner, preserving the privacy of the training datasets involved. However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy, maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Electric Vehicle (EV) technology, EVs are destined to shape the future of transportation. The large number of EVs facilitates the development of the emerging vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which realizes bidirectional energy exchanges between EVs and the power grid. This has led to the setting up of electricity markets that are usually confined to a small geographical location, often with a small number of participants. Usually, these markets are manipulated by intermediaries responsible for collecting bids from prosumers, determining the market-clearing price, incorporating grid constraints, and accounting for network losses. While centralized models can be highly efficient, they grant excessive power to the intermediary by allowing them to gain exclusive access to prosumers \textquotesingle price preferences. This opens the door to potential market manipulation and raises significant privacy concerns for users, such as the location of energy providers. This lack of protection exposes users to potential risks, as untrustworthy servers and malicious adversaries can exploit this information to infer trading activities and real identities. This work proposes a secure, decentralized exchange market built on blockchain technology, utilizing a privacy-preserving Automated Market Maker (AMM) model to offer open and fair, and equal access to traders, and mitigates the most common trading-manipulation attacks. Additionally, it incorporates a scalable architecture based on geographical dynamic sharding, allowing for efficient resource allocation and improved performance as the market grows.

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design. Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals, i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives' sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with multiple collectives.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is applied in various fields, and the number of physical devices connected to the IoT is increasingly growing. There are significant challenges to the IoT's growth and development, mainly due to the centralized nature and large-scale IoT networks. The emphasis on the decentralization of IoT's architecture can overcome challenges to IoT's capabilities. A promising decentralized platform for IoT is blockchain. Owing to IoT devices' limited resources, traditional consensus algorithms such as PoW and PoS in the blockchain are computationally expensive. Therefore, the PoA consensus algorithm is proposed in the blockchain consensus network for IoT. The PoA selects the validator as Turn-based selection (TBS) that needs optimization and faces system reliability, energy consumption, latency, and low scalability. We propose an efficient, lightweight blockchain for decentralizing IoT architecture by using virtualization and clustering to increase productivity and scalability to address these issues. We also introduce a novel PoA based on the Weight-Based-Selection (WBS) method for validators to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. By simulation, we evaluated the performance of our proposed WBS method as opposed to TBS. The results show reduced energy consumption, and response time, and increased throughput.

Abstract: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as base stations are extremely susceptible to security attacks due to their distributed and dynamic nature, which makes them vulnerable to rogue nodes. In this paper, a new Dynamic Trust Score Adjustment Mechanism with Energy-Aware Consensus (DTSAM-EAC) is proposed to enhance security in UAV-based NTNs. The proposed framework integrates a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric blockchain with Federated Learning (FL) to support privacy-preserving trust evaluation. Trust ratings are updated continuously through weighted aggregation of past trust, present behavior, and energy contribution, thus making the system adaptive to changing network conditions. An energy-aware consensus mechanism prioritizes UAVs with greater available energy for block validation, ensuring efficient use of resources under resource-constrained environments. FL aggregation with trust-weighting further increases the resilience of the global trust model. Simulation results verify the designed framework achieves 94\% trust score prediction accuracy and 96\% rogue UAV detection rate while outperforming centralized and static baselines of trust-based solutions on privacy, energy efficiency, and reliability. It complies with 6G requirements in terms of distributed intelligence and sustainability and is an energy-efficient and scalable solution to secure NTNs.

Abstract: The emergence of quantum computing presents a formidable challenge to the security of blockchain systems. Traditional cryptographic algorithms, foundational to digital signatures, message encryption, and hashing functions, become vulnerable to the immense computational power of quantum computers. This paper conducts a thorough risk assessment of transitioning to quantum-resistant blockchains, comprehensively analyzing potential threats targeting vital blockchain components: the network, mining pools, transaction verification mechanisms, smart contracts, and user wallets. By elucidating the intricate challenges and strategic considerations inherent in transitioning to quantum-resistant algorithms, the paper evaluates risks and highlights obstacles in securing blockchain components with quantum-resistant cryptography. It offers a hybrid migration strategy to facilitate a smooth transition from classical to quantum-resistant cryptography. The analysis extends to prominent blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and Zcash, assessing vulnerable components, potential impacts, and associated STRIDE threats, thereby identifying areas susceptible to quantum attacks. Beyond analysis, the paper provides actionable guidance for designing secure and resilient blockchain ecosystems in the quantum computing era. Recognizing the looming threat of quantum computers, this research advocates for a proactive transition to quantum-resistant blockchain networks. It proposes a tailored security blueprint that strategically fortifies each component against the evolving landscape of quantum-induced cyber threats. Emphasizing the critical need for blockchain stakeholders to adopt proactive measures and implement quantum-resistant solutions, the paper underscores the importance of embracing these insights to navigate the complexities of the quantum era with resilience and confidence.

Abstract: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) have emerged as powerful tools for secure and privacy-preserving computation. ZKPs enable one party to convince another of a statement's validity without revealing anything else. This capability has profound implications in many domains, including: machine learning, blockchain, image authentication, and electronic voting. Despite their potential, ZKPs have seen limited deployment because of their exceptionally high computational overhead, which manifests primarily during proof generation. To mitigate these overheads, a (growing) body of researchers has proposed hardware accelerators and GPU implementations for kernels and complete protocols. Prior art spans a wide variety of ZKP schemes that vary significantly in computational overhead, proof size, verifier cost, protocol setup, and trust. The latest, and widely used ZKP protocols are intentionally designed to balance these trade-offs. A particular challenge in modern ZKP systems is supporting complex, high-degree gates using the SumCheck protocol. We address this challenge with a novel programmable accelerator that efficiently handles arbitrary custom gates via SumCheck. Our accelerator achieves upwards of $1000\times$ geomean speedup over CPU-based SumChecks across a range of gate types. We integrate this unit into a full-system accelerator, zkPHIRE, which achieves $1486\times$ geomean speedup over CPU and $11.87\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art at iso-area. zkPHIRE is the first accelerator to scale to problem sizes of $2^{30}$ nominal constraints while maintaining small proof sizes and programmability.

<title>Geometric Decentralized Stability Condition for Power Systems Based on Projecting DW Shells</title>

Abstract: The development of decentralized stability conditions has gained considerable attention due to the need to analyze heterogeneous multi-converter power systems. A recent advance is the application of the small-phase theorem, which extends the passivity theory. However, it requires the transfer function matrix to be sectorial, which may not hold in some frequency range and will result in conservatism. This letter tackles this problem by leveraging the Davis-Wielandt (DW) shells for decentralized stability analysis. We develop a geometric decentralized stability condition that visually displays how heterogeneous converters interact with the power grid and enable modular system analysis.

Abstract: Blockchain is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that offers numerous benefits including decentralization, transparency, efficiency, and reduced costs. Hence, blockchain has been included in many fields. Blockchain relies on cryptographic protocols (especially public-key cryptography and hash functions) to achieve many essential sub-routines. However, the increased progress of quantum computation and algorithms has threatened the security of many traditional cryptosystems. Therefore, this represents a serious risk for the existing blockchain technology. For example, SHA-256 and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) cryptosystems can be compromised by Shor s and Grover s quantum algorithms in the foreseeable future. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is a basic solution for resisting these quantum attacks. Applying PQC to blockchains results in creating Post-Quantum Blockchains (PQB). Thus, this paper aims to review the threats imposed by quantum computers on classical blockchain technology and provide useful guidelines on PQB security to blockchain researchers. The paper focuses on the challenges and opportunities of future work direction in this field.

<title>Reconciling Communication Compression and Byzantine-Robustness in Distributed Learning</title>

Abstract: Distributed learning (DL) enables scalable model training over decentralized data, but remains challenged by Byzantine faults and high communication costs. While both issues have been studied extensively in isolation, their interaction is less explored. Prior work shows that naively combining communication compression with Byzantine-robust aggregation degrades resilience to faulty nodes (or workers). The state-of-the-art algorithm, namely Byz-DASHA-PAGE [29], makes use of the momentum variance reduction scheme to mitigate the detrimental impact of compression noise on Byzantine-robustness. We propose a new algorithm, named RoSDHB, that integrates the classic Polyak's momentum with a new coordinated compression mechanism. We show that RoSDHB performs comparably to Byz-DASHA-PAGE under the standard (G, B)-gradient dissimilarity heterogeneity model, while it relies on fewer assumptions. In particular, we only assume Lipschitz smoothness of the average loss function of the honest workers, in contrast to [29]that additionally assumes a special smoothness of bounded global Hessian variance. Empirical results on benchmark image classification task show that RoSDHB achieves strong robustness with significant communication savings.

Abstract: With the advent of quantum computing, cryptocurrencies that rely on blockchain technology face mounting cryptographic vulnerabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review evaluating how quantum algorithms, specifically Shors and Grovers, could disrupt the foundational security mechanisms of cryptocurrencies. Shors algorithm poses a threat to public-key cryptographic schemes by enabling efficient factorization and discrete logarithm solving, thereby endangering digital signature systems. Grovers algorithm undermines hash-based functions, increasing the feasibility of fifty one percent attacks and hash collisions. By examining the internal mechanisms of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, and Zcash, this review identifies specific vulnerabilities in transaction and consensus processes. It further analyses the current hardware limitations of quantum systems and estimates when such attacks could become feasible. In anticipation, it investigates countermeasures including Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), and protocol-level modifications such as memory-intensive proof-of-work algorithms and multi-signature schemes. The discussion integrates recent advancements in quantum error correction, hardware scalability, and NIST-standardized cryptographic algorithms. This review concludes that while quantum computers are not yet advanced enough to pose an immediate threat, proactive integration of quantum-resistant solutions is essential. The findings underscore the urgent need for cryptocurrencies to adopt post-quantum cryptographic standards to preserve the decentralized trust, integrity, and security that define blockchain-based digital cryptocurrencies.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of immersive Metaverse applications introduces complex challenges at the intersection of performance, privacy, and environmental sustainability. Centralized architectures fall short in addressing these demands, often resulting in elevated energy consumption, latency, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes MetaFed, a decentralized federated learning (FL) framework that enables sustainable and intelligent resource orchestration for Metaverse environments. MetaFed integrates (i) multi-agent reinforcement learning for dynamic client selection, (ii) privacy-preserving FL using homomorphic encryption, and (iii) carbon-aware scheduling aligned with renewable energy availability. Evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 using lightweight ResNet architectures demonstrate that MetaFed achieves up to 25\% reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional approaches, while maintaining high accuracy and minimal communication overhead. These results highlight MetaFed as a scalable solution for building environmentally responsible and privacy-compliant Metaverse infrastructures.

<title>Evaluating Compiler Optimization Impacts on zkVM Performance</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17518</link>

Abstract: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are the cornerstone of programmable cryptography. They enable (1) privacy-preserving and verifiable computation across blockchains, and (2) an expanding range of off-chain applications such as credential schemes. Zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs) lower the barrier by turning ZKPs into a drop-in backend for standard compilation pipelines. This lets developers write proof-generating programs in conventional languages (e.g., Rust or C++) instead of hand-crafting arithmetic circuits. However, these VMs inherit compiler infrastructures tuned for traditional architectures rather than for proof systems. In particular, standard compiler optimizations assume features that are absent in zkVMs, including cache locality, branch prediction, or instruction-level parallelism. Therefore, their impact on proof generation is questionable.
  We present the first systematic study of the impact of compiler optimizations on zkVMs. We evaluate 64 LLVM passes, six standard optimization levels, and an unoptimized baseline across 58 benchmarks on two RISC-V-based zkVMs (RISC Zero and SP1). While standard LLVM optimization levels do improve zkVM performance (over 40\%), their impact is far smaller than on traditional CPUs, since their decisions rely on hardware features rather than proof constraints. Guided by a fine-grained pass-level analysis, we~\emph{slightly} refine a small set of LLVM passes to be zkVM-aware, improving zkVM execution time by up to 45\% (average +4.6\% on RISC Zero, +1\% on SP1) and achieving consistent proving-time gains. Our work highlights the potential of compiler-level optimizations for zkVM performance and opens new direction for zkVM-specific passes, backends, and superoptimizers.

<title>Group Expectation Policy Optimization for Stable Heterogeneous Reinforcement Learning in LLMs</title>

Abstract: As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized training is becoming essential. Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction. Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.

Abstract: Low-altitude airspace is becoming a new frontier for smart city services and commerce. Networks of drones, electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) vehicles, and other aircraft, termed Low-Altitude Economic Networks (LAENets), promise to transform urban logistics, aerial sensing, and communication. A key challenge is how to efficiently share and trust the computing utility, termed computility, of these aerial devices. We propose treating the computing power on aircraft as tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) that can be traded and orchestrated via blockchain. By representing distributed edge computing resources as blockchain tokens, disparate devices can form Low-Altitude Computility Networks (LACNets), collaborative computing clusters in the sky. We first compare blockchain technologies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and RWA frameworks to clarify how physical hardware and its computational output can be tokenized as assets. Then, we present an architecture using blockchain to integrate aircraft fleets into a secure, interoperable computing network. Furthermore, a case study models an urban logistics LACNet of delivery drones and air-taxis. Simulation results indicate improvements in task latency, trust assurance, and resource efficiency when leveraging RWA-based coordination. Finally, we discuss future research directions, including AI-driven orchestration, edge AI offloading and collaborative computing, and cross-jurisdictional policy for tokenized assets.

<title>MoveScanner: Analysis of Security Risks of Move Smart Contracts</title>

Abstract: As blockchain technology continues to evolve, the security of smart contracts has increasingly drawn attention from both academia and industry. The Move language, with its unique resource model and linear type system, provides a solid foundation for the security of digital assets. However, smart contracts still face new security challenges due to developer programming errors and the potential risks associated with cross-module interactions. This paper systematically analyzes the limitations of existing security tools within the Move ecosystem and reveals their unique vulnerability patterns. To address these issues, it introduces MoveScanner, a static analysis tool based on a control flow graph and data flow analysis architecture. By incorporating cross-module call graph tracking, MoveScanner can effectively identify five key types of security vulnerabilities, including resource leaks, weak permission management, and arithmetic overflows. In terms of design, MoveScanner adheres to a modular principle, supports bytecode-level analysis and multi-chain adaptation, and introduces innovative resource trajectory tracking algorithms and capability matrix analysis methods, thereby significantly reducing the false positive rate. Empirical results show that MoveScanner achieved 88.2% detection accuracy in benchmark testing, filling the gap in security tools in the Move ecosystem. Furthermore, this paper identifies twelve new types of security risks based on the resource-oriented programming paradigm and provides a theoretical foundation and practical experience for the development of smart contract security mechanisms. Future work will focus on combining formal verification and dynamic analysis techniques to build a security protection framework covering the entire contract lifecycle

Abstract: This paper develops a novel COllaborative-Online-Learning (COOL)-enabled motion control framework for multi-robot systems to avoid collision amid randomly moving obstacles whose motion distributions are partially observable through decentralized data streams. To address the notable challenge of data acquisition due to occlusion, a COOL approach based on the Dirichlet process mixture model is proposed to efficiently extract motion distribution information by exchanging among robots selected learning structures. By leveraging the fine-grained local-moment information learned through COOL, a data-stream-driven ambiguity set for obstacle motion is constructed. We then introduce a novel ambiguity set propagation method, which theoretically admits the derivation of the ambiguity sets for obstacle positions over the entire prediction horizon by utilizing obstacle current positions and the ambiguity set for obstacle motion. Additionally, we develop a compression scheme with its safety guarantee to automatically adjust the complexity and granularity of the ambiguity set by aggregating basic ambiguity sets that are close in a measure space, thereby striking an attractive trade-off between control performance and computation time. Then the probabilistic collision-free trajectories are generated through distributionally robust optimization problems. The distributionally robust obstacle avoidance constraints based on the compressed ambiguity set are equivalently reformulated by deriving separating hyperplanes through tractable semi-definite programming. Finally, we establish the probabilistic collision avoidance guarantee and the long-term tracking performance guarantee for the proposed framework. The numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed approach compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Active hypothesis testing is a thoroughly studied problem that finds numerous applications in wireless communications and sensor networks. In this paper, we focus on one centralized and one decentralized problem of active hypothesis testing in the presence of an eavesdropper. For the centralized problem including a single legitimate agent, we present a new framework based on deep NeuroEvolution (NE), whereas, for the decentralized problem, we develop a novel NE-based method for solving collaborative multi-agent tasks, which, interestingly, maintains all computational benefits of our single-agent NE-based scheme. To further reduce the computational complexity of the latter scheme, a novel multi-agent joint NE and pruning framework is also designed. The superiority of the proposed NE-based evasive active hypothesis testing schemes over conventional active hypothesis testing policies, as well as learning-based methods, is validated through extensive numerical investigations in an example use case of anomaly detection over wireless sensor networks. It is demonstrated that the proposed joint optimization and pruning framework achieves nearly identical performance with its unpruned counterpart, while removing a very large percentage of redundant deep neural network weights.

Abstract: Images are the standard input for most computer vision algorithms. However, their processing often reduces to parallelizable operations applied locally and independently to individual pixels. Yet, many of these low-level raw pixel readings only provide redundant or noisy information for specific high-level tasks, leading to inefficiencies in both energy consumption during their transmission off-sensor and computational resources in their subsequent processing.
  As novel sensors featuring advanced in-pixel processing capabilities emerge, we envision a paradigm shift toward performing increasingly complex visual processing directly in-pixel, reducing computational overhead downstream. We advocate for synthesizing high-level cues at the pixel level, enabling their off-sensor transmission to directly support downstream tasks more effectively than raw pixel readings.
  This paper conceptualizes a novel photometric rotation estimation algorithm to be distributed at pixel level, where each pixel estimates the global motion of the camera by exchanging information with other pixels to achieve global consensus. We employ a probabilistic formulation and leverage Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) for decentralized inference using messaging-passing. The proposed proposed technique is evaluated on real-world public datasets and we offer a in-depth analysis of the practicality of applying GBP to distributed rotation estimation at pixel level.

Abstract: Navigating the vast, rugged, and multi-modal fitness landscapes of protein sequences presents a formidable challenge for computational protein engineering, often trapping algorithms in suboptimal solutions. Existing methods struggle with the exploration-exploitation dilemma, failing to synergize global search with deep local refinement. To overcome this critical barrier, we introduce the Octopus Inspired Optimization (OIO), a novel hierarchical metaheuristic that mimics the octopus's unique neural architecture of centralized control and decentralized, parallel execution. OIO's "individual-tentacle-sucker" framework provides an intrinsic unification of global exploration and parallelized local exploitation, making it structurally ideal for complex combinatorial problems. We validated OIO's efficacy through a rigorous three-tiered experimental framework. On a real-world Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) design benchmark, OIO surpassed a comprehensive suite of 15 competing metaheuristics, including 7 classic algorithms and 8 state-of-the-art methods from the past two years, delivering performance comparable only to a specialized local search algorithm. This success is explained by its fundamental strengths: OIO ranked first on the NK-Landscape benchmark, confirming its architectural suitability for protein-like fitness landscapes, and also ranked first on the gold-standard CEC2022 benchmark, demonstrating the raw power and efficiency of its optimization engine. OIO establishes a new, nature-inspired paradigm for protein engineering, offering a robust and powerful tool with significant potential for advancing therapeutic and enzymatic design.

Abstract: While large pre-trained models have achieved impressive performance across AI tasks, their deployment in privacy-sensitive and distributed environments remains challenging. Federated learning (FL) offers a viable solution by enabling decentralized fine-tuning without data sharing, but real-world applications face significant obstacles due to heterogeneous client resources in compute and memory. To address this, we propose HeteroTune, a novel federated fine-tuning paradigm for large, heterogeneous models operating under limited communication and computation budgets. The core of our method lies in a novel architecture, DeMA (Dense Mixture of Adapters), which enables flexible and efficient aggregation of heterogeneous models by preserving their full representational capacity while facilitating seamless cross-model knowledge fusion. We further introduce CMGA (Cross-Model Gradient Alignment), a lightweight yet effective mechanism that enhances training stability by harmonizing gradient directions across heterogeneous client models during aggregation, mitigating update conflicts and promoting more consistent convergence in federated settings. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence showing that HeteroTune achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency across diverse tasks and model architectures. For example, on LLaMA models, it reduces communication overhead by 99.5%, cuts peak memory usage by ~50%, and improves performance by 4.61%.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed code generation. However, most existing approaches focus on mainstream languages such as Python and Java, neglecting the Solidity language, the predominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Due to the lack of adequate benchmarks for Solidity, LLMs' ability to generate secure, cost-effective smart contracts remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we construct SolEval, the first repository-level benchmark designed for Solidity smart contract generation, to evaluate the performance of LLMs on Solidity. SolEval consists of 1,507 samples from 28 different repositories, covering 6 popular domains, providing LLMs with a comprehensive evaluation benchmark. Unlike the existing Solidity benchmark, SolEval not only includes complex function calls but also reflects the real-world complexity of the Ethereum ecosystem by incorporating Gas@k and Vul@k. We evaluate 16 LLMs on SolEval, and our results show that the best-performing LLM achieves only 26.29% Pass@10, highlighting substantial room for improvement in Solidity code generation by LLMs. Additionally, we conduct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Qwen-7B using SolEval, resulting in a significant performance improvement, with Pass@5 increasing from 16.67% to 58.33%, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning LLMs on our benchmark. We release our data and code at https://github.com/pzy2000/SolEval.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) is a combination of distributed quantum computing and federated machine learning, integrating the strengths of both to enable privacy-preserving decentralized learning with quantum-enhanced capabilities. It appears as a promising approach for addressing challenges in efficient and secure model training across distributed quantum systems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on QFL, exploring its key concepts, fundamentals, applications, and emerging challenges in this rapidly developing field. Specifically, we begin with an introduction to the recent advancements of QFL, followed by discussion on its market opportunity and background knowledge. We then discuss the motivation behind the integration of quantum computing and federated learning, highlighting its working principle. Moreover, we review the fundamentals of QFL and its taxonomy. Particularly, we explore federation architecture, networking topology, communication schemes, optimization techniques, and security mechanisms within QFL frameworks. Furthermore, we investigate applications of QFL across several domains which include vehicular networks, healthcare networks, satellite networks, metaverse, and network security. Additionally, we analyze frameworks and platforms related to QFL, delving into its prototype implementations, and provide a detailed case study. Key insights and lessons learned from this review of QFL are also highlighted. We complete the survey by identifying current challenges and outlining potential avenues for future research in this rapidly advancing field.

Abstract: The very high growth of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has generated an urgent requirement for secure, effective, and context-aware data sharing mechanisms, especially over heterogeneous and geographically dispersed settings. This work suggests a new architecture that combines a relay chain-driven encryption system with a modified Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme to tackle the double impediment of dynamic access and low-latency communication. The model proposes a context-aware smart contract on a worldwide relay chain that checks against data properties, including event type, time, and geographical region, to specify the suitable level of encryption policy. From such relay-directed judgment, On-Board Units (OBUs) encrypt data end-to-end by utilising CP-ABE and store ciphertext inside localised regional blockchains, preventing dependence on symmetric encryption or off-chain storage. High-sensitivity events are secured with firm, multi-attribute access rules, whereas common updates use light policies to help reduce processing burdens. The crypto system also adds traceability and low-latency revocation, with global enforcement managed through the relay chain. This distributed, scalable model provides a proper balance between responsiveness in real time and security and is extremely apt for next-gen vehicular networks that function across multi-jurisdictional domains.

Abstract: This paper studies proof-of-work Nakamoto consensus under bounded network delays, settling two long-standing questions in blockchain security: How can an adversary most effectively attack block safety under a given block confirmation latency? And what is the resulting probability of safety violation? A Markov decision process (MDP) framework is introduced to precise characterize the system state (including the tree and timings of all blocks mined), the adversary's potential actions, and the state transitions due to the adversarial action and the random block arrival processes. An optimal attack, called bait-and-switch, is proposed and proved to maximize the adversary's chance of violating block safety by "beating Nakamoto in the race". The exact probability of this violation is calculated for any confirmation depth using Markov chain analysis, offering fresh insights into the interplay of network delay, confirmation rules, and blockchain security.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables training models across decentralized data silos while preserving client data privacy. Recent research has explored efficient methods for post-training large language models (LLMs) within FL to address computational and communication challenges. While existing approaches often rely on access to LLMs' internal information, which is frequently restricted in real-world scenarios, an inference-only paradigm (black-box FedLLM) has emerged to address these limitations. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy categorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter efficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box, gray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within each category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference APIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.

Abstract: The Optimism Retroactive Project Funding (RetroPGF) is a key initiative within the blockchain ecosystem that retroactively rewards projects deemed valuable to the Ethereum and Optimism communities. Managed by the Optimism Collective, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), RetroPGF represents a large-scale experiment in decentralized governance. Funding rewards are distributed in OP tokens, the native digital currency of the ecosystem. As of this writing, four funding rounds have been completed, collectively allocating over 100M dollars, with an additional 1.3B dollars reserved for future rounds. However, we identify significant shortcomings in the current allocation system, underscoring the need for improved governance mechanisms given the scale of funds involved.
  Leveraging computational social choice techniques and insights from multiagent systems, we propose improvements to the voting process by recommending the adoption of a utilitarian moving phantoms mechanism. This mechanism, originally introduced by Freeman et al. in 2019, is designed to enhance social welfare (using the L1 norm) while satisfying strategyproofness -- two key properties aligned with the application's governance requirements. Our analysis provides a formal framework for designing improved funding mechanisms for DAOs, contributing to the broader discourse on decentralized governance and public goods allocation.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) envisions the widespread use of small aerial vehicles to transform transportation in dense urban environments. However, UAM faces critical operational challenges, particularly the balance between minimizing noise exposure and maintaining safe separation in low-altitude urban airspace, two objectives that are often addressed separately. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based air traffic management system that integrates both noise and safety considerations within a unified, decentralized framework. Under this scalable air traffic coordination solution, agents operate in a structured, multi-layered airspace and learn altitude adjustment policies to jointly manage noise impact and separation constraints. The system demonstrates strong performance across both objectives and reveals tradeoffs among separation, noise exposure, and energy efficiency under high traffic density. The findings highlight the potential of RL and multi-objective coordination strategies in enhancing the safety, quietness, and efficiency of UAM operations.

<title>Swarming Without an Anchor (SWA): Robot Swarms Adapt Better to Localization Dropouts Then a Single Robot</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Swarming Without an Anchor (SWA) approach to state estimation in swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) experiencing ego-localization dropout, where individual agents are laterally stabilized using relative information only. We propose to fuse decentralized state estimation with robust mutual perception and onboard sensor data to maintain accurate state awareness despite intermittent localization failures. Thus, the relative information used to estimate the lateral state of UAVs enables the identification of the unambiguous state of UAVs with respect to the local constellation. The resulting behavior reaches velocity consensus, as this task can be referred to as the double integrator synchronization problem. All disturbances and performance degradations except a uniform translation drift of the swarm as a whole is attenuated which is enabling new opportunities in using tight cooperation for increasing reliability and resilience of multi-UAV systems. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its capability to sustain cohesive swarm behavior in challenging conditions of unreliable or unavailable primary localization.

Abstract: Federated learning is an emerging technology for training machine learning models across decentralized data sources without sharing data. Vertical federated learning, also known as feature-based federated learning, applies to scenarios where data sources have the same sample IDs but different feature sets. To ensure fairness among data owners, it is critical to objectively assess the contributions from different data sources and compensate the corresponding data owners accordingly. The Shapley value is a provably fair contribution valuation metric originating from cooperative game theory. However, its straight-forward computation requires extensively retraining a model on each potential combination of data sources, leading to prohibitively high communication and computation overheads due to multiple rounds of federated learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose a contribution valuation metric called vertical federated Shapley value (VerFedSV) based on the classic Shapley value. We show that VerFedSV not only satisfies many desirable properties of fairness but is also efficient to compute. Moreover, VerFedSV can be adapted to both synchronous and asynchronous vertical federated learning algorithms. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results demonstrate the fairness, efficiency, adaptability, and effectiveness of VerFedSV.

Abstract: The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem aims to determine the shortest and collision-free paths for multiple agents in a known, potentially obstacle-ridden environment. It is the core challenge for robotic deployments in large-scale logistics and transportation. Decentralized learning-based approaches have shown great potential for addressing the MAPF problems, offering more reactive and scalable solutions. However, existing learning-based MAPF methods usually rely on agents making decisions based on a limited field of view (FOV), resulting in short-sighted policies and inefficient cooperation in complex scenarios. There, a critical challenge is to achieve consensus on potential movements between agents based on limited observations and communications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new framework that applies sheaf theory to decentralized deep reinforcement learning, enabling agents to learn geometric cross-dependencies between each other through local consensus and utilize them for tightly cooperative decision-making. In particular, sheaf theory provides a mathematical proof of conditions for achieving global consensus through local observation. Inspired by this, we incorporate a neural network to approximately model the consensus in latent space based on sheaf theory and train it through self-supervised learning. During the task, in addition to normal features for MAPF as in previous works, each agent distributedly reasons about a learned consensus feature, leading to efficient cooperation on pathfinding and collision avoidance. As a result, our proposed method demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art learning-based MAPF planners, especially in relatively large and complex scenarios, demonstrating its superiority over baselines in various simulations and real-world robot experiments.

Abstract: Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimizing wireless networks, but faces challenges with large state-spaces. Recently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses these challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple synthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments, so-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ (M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple networked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to global information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated and uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state and update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the probability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations show that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 60% lower average policy error (APE), 40% faster convergence, 45% reduced runtime complexity, and 40% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves comparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a powerful framework for privacy-preserving distributed learning. It enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, handling noisy labels in FL remains a major challenge due to heterogeneous data distributions and communication constraints, which can severely degrade model performance. To address this issue, we propose FedEFC, a novel method designed to tackle the impact of noisy labels in FL. FedEFC mitigates this issue through two key techniques: (1) prestopping, which prevents overfitting to mislabeled data by dynamically halting training at an optimal point, and (2) loss correction, which adjusts model updates to account for label noise. In particular, we develop an effective loss correction tailored to the unique challenges of FL, including data heterogeneity and decentralized training. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis, leveraging the composite proper loss property, to demonstrate that the FL objective function under noisy label distributions can be aligned with the clean label distribution. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it consistently outperforms existing FL techniques in mitigating the impact of noisy labels, particularly under heterogeneous data settings (e.g., achieving up to 41.64% relative performance improvement over the existing loss correction method).

Abstract: Wildlife field operations demand efficient parallel deployment methods to identify and interact with specific individuals, enabling simultaneous collective behavioral analysis, and health and safety interventions. Previous robotics solutions approach the problem from the herd perspective, or are manually operated and limited in scale. We propose a decentralized vision-based multi-quadrotor system for wildlife monitoring that is scalable, low-bandwidth, and sensor-minimal (single onboard RGB camera). Our approach enables robust identification and tracking of large species in their natural habitat. We develop novel vision-based coordination and tracking algorithms designed for dynamic, unstructured environments without reliance on centralized communication or control. We validate our system through real-world experiments, demonstrating reliable deployment in diverse field conditions.

Abstract: Agent-based simulation platforms play a key role in enabling fast-to-run evolution experiments that can be precisely controlled and observed in detail. Availability of high-resolution snapshots of lineage ancestries from digital experiments, in particular, is key to investigations of evolvability and open-ended evolution, as well as in providing a validation testbed for bioinformatics method development. Ongoing advances in AI/ML hardware accelerator devices, such as the 850,000-processor Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE), are poised to broaden the scope of evolutionary questions that can be investigated in silico. However, constraints in memory capacity and locality characteristic of these systems introduce difficulties in exhaustively tracking phylogenies at runtime. To overcome these challenges, recent work on hereditary stratigraphy algorithms has developed space-efficient genetic markers to facilitate fully decentralized estimation of relatedness among digital organisms. However, in existing work, compute time to reconstruct phylogenies from these genetic markers has proven a limiting factor in achieving large-scale phyloanalyses. Here, we detail an improved trie-building algorithm designed to produce reconstructions equivalent to existing approaches. For modestly-sized 10,000-tip trees, the proposed approach achieves a 300-fold speedup versus existing state-of-the-art. Finally, using 1 billion genome datasets drawn from WSE simulations encompassing 954 trillion replication events, we report a pair of large-scale phylogeny reconstruction trials, achieving end-to-end reconstruction times of 2.6 and 2.9 hours. In substantially improving reconstruction scaling and throughput, presented work establishes a key foundation to enable powerful high-throughput phyloanalysis techniques in large-scale digital evolution experiments.

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori. Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in decentralized data processing.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted as a decentralized training paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model without exposing their local data. As concerns over data privacy and regulatory compliance grow, machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of specific data from trained models, has become increasingly important in the federated setting to meet legal, ethical, or user-driven demands. However, integrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely unexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the unlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this paper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated unlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the global model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we propose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor and camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated training process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage samples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state. Extensive experiments under various FL frameworks and unlearning strategies validate the effectiveness of BadFU, revealing a critical vulnerability in current federated unlearning practices and underscoring the urgent need for more secure and robust federated unlearning mechanisms.

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all evaluated environments.

Abstract: This study identifies the key factors influencing the price movements of major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Binance Coin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Tether, using Bayesian networks (BNs). This study addresses two key challenges: modelling price movements in highly volatile cryptocurrency markets and enhancing predictive performance through discretisation-aware Bayesian Networks. It analyses both macro-financial indicators (gold, oil, MSCI, S and P 500, USDX) and social media signals (tweet volume) as potential price drivers. Moreover, since discretisation is a critical step in the effectiveness of BNs, we implement a structured procedure to build 54 BNs models by combining three discretisation methods (equal interval, equal quantile, and k-means) with several bin counts. These models are evaluated using four metrics, including balanced accuracy, F1 score, area under the ROC curve and a composite score. Results show that equal interval with two bins consistently yields the best predictive performance. We also provide deeper insights into each network's structure through inference, sensitivity, and influence strength analyses. These analyses reveal distinct price-driving patterns for each cryptocurrency, underscore the importance of coin-specific analysis, and demonstrate the value of BNs for interpretable causal modelling in volatile cryptocurrency markets.

Abstract: Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) are pivotal in numerous high-impact key-value applications built on distributed networked systems, offering a decentralized architecture that avoids single points of failure and improves data availability. Despite their widespread utility, DHTs face substantial challenges in handling range queries, which are crucial for applications such as LLM serving, distributed storage, databases, content delivery networks, and blockchains. To address this limitation, we present LEAD, a novel system incorporating learned models within DHT structures to significantly optimize range query performance. LEAD utilizes a recursive machine learning model to map and retrieve data across a distributed system while preserving the inherent order of data. LEAD includes the designs to minimize range query latency and message cost while maintaining high scalability and resilience to network churn. Our comprehensive evaluations, conducted in both testbed implementation and simulations, demonstrate that LEAD achieves tremendous advantages in system efficiency compared to existing range query methods in large-scale distributed systems, reducing query latency and message cost by 80% to 90%+. Furthermore, LEAD exhibits remarkable scalability and robustness against system churn, providing a robust, scalable solution for efficient data retrieval in distributed key-value systems.

<title>A Hierarchical Sharded Blockchain Balancing Performance and Availability</title>

Abstract: Blockchain networks offer decentralization, transparency, and immutability for managing critical data but encounter scalability problems as the number of network members and transaction issuers grows. Sharding is considered a promising solution to enhance blockchain scalability. However, most existing blockchain sharding techniques prioritize performance at the cost of availability (e.g., a failure in a few servers holding a shard leads to data unavailability). In this paper, we propose PyloChain, a hierarchical sharded blockchain that balances availability and performance. PyloChain consists of multiple lower-level local chains and one higher-level main chain. Each local chain speculatively executes local transactions to achieve high parallelism across multiple local chains. The main chain leverages a directed-acyclic-graph (DAG)-based mempool to guarantee local block availability and to enable efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus to execute global (or cross-shard) transactions within a collocated sharding. PyloChain speculatively executes local transactions across multiple local chains to achieve high parallelism. In order to reduce the number of aborted local transactions, PyloChain applies a simple scheduling technique to handle global transactions in the main chain. PyloChain provides a fine-grained auditing mechanism to mitigate faulty higher-level members by externalizing main chain operations to lower-level local members. We implemented and evaluated PyloChain, demonstrating its performance scalability with 1.49x higher throughput and 2.63x faster latency compared to the state-of-the-art balanced hierarchical sharded blockchain.

Abstract: Security has always been a priority, for researchers, service providers and network operators when it comes to radio access networks (RAN). One wireless access approach that has captured attention is blockchain enabled RAN (B-RAN) due to its secure nature. This research introduces a framework that integrates blockchain technology into RAN while also addressing the limitations of state-of-the-art models. The proposed framework utilizes queuing and Markov chain theory to model the aspects of B-RAN. An extensive evaluation of the models performance is provided, including an analysis of timing factors and a focused assessment of its security aspects. The results demonstrate reduced latency and comparable security making the presented framework suitable for diverse application scenarios.

Abstract: Payment channel networks (PCNs) are a promising technology that alleviates blockchain scalability by shifting the transaction load from the blockchain to the PCN. Nevertheless, the network topology has to be carefully designed to maximise the transaction throughput in PCNs. Additionally, users in PCNs also have to make optimal decisions on which transactions to forward and which to reject to prolong the lifetime of their channels. In this work, we consider an input sequence of transactions over $p$ parties. Each transaction consists of a transaction size, source, and target, and can be either accepted or rejected (entailing a cost). The goal is to design a PCN topology among the $p$ cooperating parties, along with the channel capacities, and then output a decision for each transaction in the sequence to minimise the cost of creating and augmenting channels, as well as the cost of rejecting transactions. Our main contribution is an $\mathcal{O}(p)$ approximation algorithm for the problem with $p$ parties. We further show that with some assumptions on the distribution of transactions, we can reduce the approximation ratio to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{p})$. We complement our theoretical analysis with an empirical study of our assumptions and approach in the context of the Lightning Network.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is increasingly adopted for privacy-preserving collaborative training, but its decentralized nature makes it particularly susceptible to backdoor attacks. Existing attack methods, however, often rely on idealized assumptions and fail to remain effective under real-world constraints, such as limited attacker control, non-IID data distributions, and the presence of diverse defense mechanisms. To address this gap, we propose DOPA (Divergent Optimization Path Attack), a novel framework that simulates heterogeneous local training dynamics and seeks consensus across divergent optimization trajectories to craft universally effective and stealthy backdoor triggers. By leveraging consistency signals across simulated paths to guide optimization, DOPA overcomes the challenge of heterogeneity-induced instability and achieves practical attack viability under stringent federated constraints. We validate DOPA on a comprehensive suite of 12 defense strategies, two model architectures (ResNet18/VGG16), two datasets (CIFAR-10/TinyImageNet), and both mild and extreme non-IID settings. Despite operating under a single-client, black-box, and sparsely participating threat model, DOPA consistently achieves high attack success, minimal accuracy degradation, low runtime, and long-term persistence. These results demonstrate a more practical attack paradigm, offering new perspectives for designing robust defense strategies in federated learning systems

Abstract: Traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) typically rely on pre-analysis of the target area, network size, and sensor coverage to determine initial deployment. This often results in significant overlap to ensure continued network operation despite sensor energy depletion. With the emergence of Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs), issues such as sensor failure and static coverage limitations can be more effectively addressed through mobility. This paper proposes a novel deployment strategy in which mobile sensors autonomously position themselves to maximize area coverage, eliminating the need for predefined policies. A live camera system, combined with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), monitors the network by detecting sensor LED indicators and evaluating real-time coverage. Rewards based on coverage efficiency and sensor movement are computed at each learning step and shared across the network through a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework, enabling decentralized, cooperative sensor control. Key contributions include a vision-based, low-cost coverage evaluation method; a scalable MARL-DRL framework for autonomous deployment; and a self-reconfigurable system that adjusts sensor positioning in response to energy depletion. Compared to traditional distance-based localization, the proposed method achieves a 26.5% improvement in coverage, a 32% reduction in energy consumption, and a 22% decrease in redundancy, extending network lifetime by 45%. This approach significantly enhances adaptability, energy efficiency, and robustness in MWSNs, offering a practical deployment solution within the IoT framework.

Abstract: Efficient energy management is essential in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to extend network lifetime and ensure reliable data transmission. This paper presents a novel method using reinforcement learning-based cluster-head selection and a hybrid multi-hop routing algorithm, which leverages Q-learning within a multi-agent system to dynamically adapt transmission paths based on the energy distribution across sensor nodes. Each sensor node is modeled as an autonomous agent that observes local state parameters, such as residual energy, distance to sink, hop count, and hotspot proximity, and selects routing actions that maximize long-term energy efficiency. After computing the optimal paths, each sensor aggregates sensed data and forwards it through intermediate nodes to a selected transmitter node, chosen based on the highest remaining State of Charge (SoC), thereby avoiding premature node depletion. To promote efficient learning, a carefully designed reward function incentivizes balanced load distribution, hotspot avoidance, and energy-aware forwarding while maintaining signal quality. The learning process occurs either in a decentralized manner or via a cloud-based controller that offloads computation in large-scale deployments. Moreover, the RL-driven routing decisions are fused with classical graph-based methods, Minimum Energy Routing Algorithm (MERA) and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), to optimize energy consumption and load balancing. Simulations confirm that the proposed approach significantly improves node survival rate, reduces SoC variance, and enhances network resilience, making it a scalable and adaptive solution for energy-constrained WSNs in dynamic sensor deployments and IoT applications.

<title>FLAIR: Feedback Learning for Adaptive Information Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven the adoption of copilots in complex technical scenarios, underscoring the growing need for specialized information retrieval solutions. In this paper, we introduce FLAIR, a lightweight, feedback learning framework that adapts copilot systems' retrieval strategies by integrating domain-specific expert feedback. FLAIR operates in two stages: an offline phase obtains indicators from (1) user feedback and (2) questions synthesized from documentation, storing these indicators in a decentralized manner. An online phase then employs a two-track ranking mechanism to combine raw similarity scores with the collected indicators. This iterative setup refines retrieval performance for any query. Extensive real-world evaluations of FLAIR demonstrate significant performance gains on both previously seen and unseen queries, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches. The system has been successfully integrated into Copilot DECO, serving thousands of users at Microsoft, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness in operational environments.

Abstract: The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to navigate constrained and cluttered environments (e.g., doorways, hallways, corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs are tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general multi-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain distinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them. Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs, which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods specialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years. However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation, etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly.

<title>Optimizing Scalar Selection in Elliptic Curve Cryptography Using Differential Evolution for Enhanced Security</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13520</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.13520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a fundamental component of modern public-key cryptosystems that enable efficient and secure digital signatures, key exchanges, and encryption. Its core operation, scalar multiplication, denoted as $k \cdot P$, where $P$ is a base point and $k$ is a private scalar, relies heavily on the secrecy and unpredictability of $k$. Conventionally, $k$ is selected using user input or pseudorandom number generators. However, in resource-constrained environments with weak entropy sources, these approaches may yield low-entropy or biased scalars, increasing susceptibility to side-channel and key recovery attacks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we introduce an optimization-driven scalar generation method that explicitly maximizes bit-level entropy. Our approach uses differential evolution (DE), a population-based metaheuristic algorithm, to search for scalars whose binary representations exhibit maximal entropy, defined by an even and statistically uniform distribution of ones and zeros. This reformulation of scalar selection as an entropy-optimization problem enhances resistance to entropy-based cryptanalytic techniques and improves overall unpredictability. Experimental results demonstrate that DE-optimized scalars achieve entropy significantly higher than conventionally generated scalars. The proposed method can be integrated into existing ECC-based protocols, offering a deterministic, tunable alternative to traditional randomness, ideal for applications in blockchain, secure messaging, IoT, and other resource-constrained environments.

<title>Towards a Larger Model via One-Shot Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Client Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13625</link>

Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients, and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational resources.

<title>Hierarchical Vision-Language Retrieval of Educational Metaverse Content in Agriculture</title>

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\% MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/aliabdari/Agricultural_Metaverse_Retrieval .

<title>BetaWeb: Towards a Blockchain-enabled Trustworthy Agentic Web</title>

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the development of artificial intelligence (AI) agents, which are increasingly evolving into diverse autonomous entities, advancing the LLM-based multi-agent systems (LaMAS). However, current agentic ecosystems remain fragmented and closed. Establishing an interconnected and scalable paradigm for Agentic AI has become a critical prerequisite. Although Agentic Web proposes an open architecture to break the ecosystem barriers, its implementation still faces core challenges such as privacy protection, data management, and value measurement. Existing centralized or semi-centralized paradigms suffer from inherent limitations, making them inadequate for supporting large-scale, heterogeneous, and cross-domain autonomous interactions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the blockchain-enabled trustworthy Agentic Web (BetaWeb). By leveraging the inherent strengths of blockchain, BetaWeb not only offers a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure for LaMAS but also has the potential to advance the Web paradigm from Web3 (centered on data ownership) towards Web3.5, which emphasizes ownership of agent capabilities and the monetization of intelligence. Beyond a systematic examination of the BetaWeb framework, this paper presents a five-stage evolutionary roadmap, outlining the path of LaMAS from passive execution to advanced collaboration and autonomous governance. We also conduct a comparative analysis of existing products and discuss key challenges of BetaWeb from multiple perspectives. Ultimately, we argue that deep integration between blockchain and LaMAS can lay the foundation for a resilient, trustworthy, and sustainably incentivized digital ecosystem. A summary of the enabling technologies for each stage is available at https://github.com/MatZaharia/BetaWeb.

Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of federated learning.

Abstract: Load imbalance pervasively exists in distributed deep learning training systems, either caused by the inherent imbalance in learned tasks or by the system itself. Traditional synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) achieves good accuracy for a wide variety of tasks, but relies on global synchronization to accumulate the gradients at every training step. In this paper, we propose eager-SGD, which relaxes the global synchronization for decentralized accumulation. To implement eager-SGD, we propose to use two partial collectives: solo and majority. With solo allreduce, the faster processes contribute their gradients eagerly without waiting for the slower processes, whereas with majority allreduce, at least half of the participants must contribute gradients before continuing, all without using a central parameter server. We theoretically prove the convergence of the algorithms and describe the partial collectives in detail. Experimental results on load-imbalanced environments (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and UCF101 datasets) show that eager-SGD achieves 1.27x speedup over the state-of-the-art synchronous SGD, without losing accuracy.

<title>Breaking (Global) Barriers in Parallel Stochastic Optimization with Wait-Avoiding Group Averaging</title>

Abstract: Deep learning at scale is dominated by communication time. Distributing samples across nodes usually yields the best performance, but poses scaling challenges due to global information dissemination and load imbalance across uneven sample lengths. State-of-the-art decentralized optimizers mitigate the problem, but require more iterations to achieve the same accuracy as their globally-communicating counterparts. We present Wait-Avoiding Group Model Averaging (WAGMA) SGD, a wait-avoiding stochastic optimizer that reduces global communication via subgroup weight exchange. The key insight is a combination of algorithmic changes to the averaging scheme and the use of a group allreduce operation. We prove the convergence of WAGMA-SGD, and empirically show that it retains convergence rates similar to Allreduce-SGD. For evaluation, we train ResNet-50 on ImageNet; Transformer for machine translation; and deep reinforcement learning for navigation at scale. Compared with state-of-the-art decentralized SGD variants, WAGMA-SGD significantly improves training throughput (e.g., 2.1x on 1,024 GPUs for reinforcement learning), and achieves the fastest time-to-solution (e.g., the highest score using the shortest training time for Transformer).

<title>Reclaiming Constitutional Authority of Algorithmic Power</title>

Abstract: Whether and how to govern AI is no longer a question of technical regulation. It is a question of constitutional authority. Across jurisdictions, algorithmic systems now perform functions once reserved to public institutions: allocating welfare, determining legal status, mediating access to housing, employment, and healthcare. These are not merely administrative operations. They are acts of rule. Yet the dominant models of AI governance fail to confront this reality. The European approach centers on rights-based oversight, presenting its regulatory framework as a principled defense of human dignity. The American model relies on decentralized experimentation, treating fragmentation as a proxy for democratic legitimacy. Both, in different ways, evade the structural question: who authorizes algorithmic power, through what institutions, and on what terms. This Article offers an alternative. Drawing from early modern Reformed political thought, it reconstructs a constitutional framework grounded in covenantal authority and the right of lawful resistance. It argues that algorithmic governance must rest on three principles. First, that all public power must be lawfully delegated through participatory authorization. Second, that authority must be structured across representative communities with the standing to consent, contest, or refuse. Third, that individuals retain a constitutional right to resist systems that impose orthodoxy or erode the domain of conscience. These principles are then operationalized through doctrinal analysis of federalism, nondelegation, compelled speech, and structural accountability. On this view, the legitimacy of algorithmic governance turns not on procedural safeguards or policy design, but on whether it reflects a constitutional order in which power is authorized by the governed, constrained by law, and answerable to those it affects.

Abstract: The Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm has gained significant attention in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and is the foundation of many recent algorithms. However, decentralized policies operate under partial observability and often yield suboptimal performance compared to centralized policies, while fully centralized approaches typically face scalability challenges as the number of agents increases.
  We propose Centralized Permutation Equivariant (CPE) learning, a centralized training and execution framework that employs a fully centralized policy to overcome these limitations. Our approach leverages a novel permutation equivariant architecture, Global-Local Permutation Equivariant (GLPE) networks, that is lightweight, scalable, and easy to implement. Experiments show that CPE integrates seamlessly with both value decomposition and actor-critic methods, substantially improving the performance of standard CTDE algorithms across cooperative benchmarks including MPE, SMAC, and RWARE, and matching the performance of state-of-the-art RWARE implementations.

Abstract: The advancement of computing equipment and the advances in services over the Internet has allowed corporations, higher education, and many other organizations to pursue the shared computing network environment. A requirement for shared computing environments is a centralized identity system to authenticate and authorize user access. An organization's digital identity plane is a prime target for cyber threat actors. When compromised, identities can be exploited to steal credentials, create unauthorized accounts, and manipulate permissions-enabling attackers to gain control of the network and undermine its confidentiality, availability, and integrity. Cybercrime losses reached a record of 16.6 B in the United States in 2024. For organizations using Microsoft software, Active Directory is the on-premises identity system of choice. In this article, we examine the challenge of security compromises in Active Directory (AD) environments and present effective strategies to prevent credential theft and limit lateral movement by threat actors. Our proposed approaches aim to confine the movement of compromised credentials, preventing significant privilege escalation and theft. We argue that through our illustration of real-world scenarios, tiering can halt lateral movement and advanced cyber-attacks, thus reducing ransom escalation. Our work bridges a gap in existing literature by combining technical guidelines with theoretical arguments in support of tiering, positioning it as a vital component of modern cybersecurity strategy even though it cannot function in isolation. As the hardware advances and the cloud sourced services along with AI is advancing with unprecedented speed, we think it is important for security experts and the business to work together and start designing and developing software and frameworks to classify devices automatically and accurately within the tiered structure.

<title>On Balancing Sparsity with Reliable Connectivity in Distributed Network Design with Random K-out Graphs</title>

arXiv:2508.11863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In several applications in distributed systems, an important design criterion is ensuring that the network is sparse, i.e., does not contain too many edges, while achieving reliable connectivity. Sparsity ensures communication overhead remains low, while reliable connectivity is tied to reliable communication and inference on decentralized data reservoirs and computational resources. A class of network models called random K-out graphs appear widely as a heuristic to balance connectivity and sparsity, especially in settings with limited trust, e.g., privacy-preserving aggregation of networked data in which networks are deployed. However, several questions remain regarding how to choose network parameters in response to different operational requirements, including the need to go beyond asymptotic results and the ability to model the stochastic and adversarial environments. To address this gap, we present theorems to inform the choice of network parameters that guarantee reliable connectivity in regimes where nodes can be finite or unreliable. We first derive upper and lower bounds for probability of connectivity in random K-out graphs when the number of nodes is finite. Next, we analyze the property of r-robustness, a stronger notion than connectivity that enables resilient consensus in the presence of malicious nodes. Finally, motivated by aggregation mechanisms based on pairwise masking, we model and analyze the impact of a subset of adversarial nodes, modeled as deletions, on connectivity and giant component size - metrics that are closely tied to privacy guarantees. Together, our results pave the way for end-to-end performance guarantees for a suite of algorithms for reliable inference on networks.

Abstract: Unsupervised federated learning (UFL) has gained attention as a privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning approach that eliminates the need for labor-intensive data labeling. However, UFL faces several challenges in practical applications: (1) non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data distribution across devices, (2) expensive computational and communication costs at the edge, and (3) vulnerability to communication noise. Previous UFL approaches have relied on deep neural networks (NN), which introduce substantial overhead in both computation and communication. In this paper, we propose FedUHD, the first UFL framework based on Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). HDC is a brain-inspired computing scheme with lightweight training and inference operations, much smaller model size, and robustness to communication noise. FedUHD introduces two novel HDC-based designs to improve UFL performance. On the client side, a kNN-based cluster hypervector removal method addresses non-iid data samples by eliminating detrimental outliers. On the server side, a weighted HDC aggregation technique balances the non-iid data distribution across clients. Our experiments demonstrate that FedUHD achieves up to 173.6x and 612.7x better speedup and energy efficiency, respectively, in training, up to 271x lower communication cost, and 15.50% higher accuracy on average across diverse settings, along with superior robustness to various types of noise compared to state-of-the-art NN-based UFL approaches.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a vital paradigm in modern machine learning that enables collaborative training across decentralized data sources without exchanging raw data. This approach not only addresses privacy concerns but also allows access to overall substantially larger and potentially more diverse datasets, without the need for centralized storage or hardware resources. However, heterogeneity in client data may cause certain clients to have disproportionate impacts on the global model, leading to disparities in the clients' performances. Fairness, therefore, becomes a crucial concern in FL and can be addressed in various ways. However, the effectiveness of existing fairness-aware methods, particularly in heterogeneous data settings, remains unclear, and the relationships between different approaches are not well understood. In this work, we focus on performance equitable fairness, which aims to minimize differences in performance across clients. We restrict our study to fairness-aware methods that explicitly regularize client losses, evaluating both existing and newly proposed approaches. We identify and theoretically explain connections between the investigated fairness methods, and empirically show that FairGrad (approximate) and FairGrad* (exact) (two variants of a gradient variance regularization method introduced here for performance equitable fairness) improve both fairness and overall model performance in heterogeneous data settings.

Abstract: Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning conflict-free paths from the designated start locations to goal positions for multiple agents. It underlies a variety of real-world tasks, including multi-robot coordination, robot-assisted logistics, and social navigation. Recent decentralized learnable solvers have shown great promise for large-scale MAPF, especially when leveraging foundation models and large datasets. However, these agents are reactive policy models and exhibit limited modeling of environmental temporal dynamics and inter-agent dependencies, resulting in performance degradation in complex, long-term planning scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose MAPF-World, an autoregressive action world model for MAPF that unifies situation understanding and action generation, guiding decisions beyond immediate local observations. It improves situational awareness by explicitly modeling environmental dynamics, including spatial features and temporal dependencies, through future state and actions prediction. By incorporating these predicted futures, MAPF-World enables more informed, coordinated, and far-sighted decision-making, especially in complex multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we augment MAPF benchmarks by introducing an automatic map generator grounded in real-world scenarios, capturing practical map layouts for training and evaluating MAPF solvers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAPF-World outperforms state-of-the-art learnable solvers, showcasing superior zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution cases. Notably, MAPF-World is trained with a 96.5% smaller model size and 92% reduced data.

<title>Ethereum Crypto Wallets under Address Poisoning: How Usable and Secure Are They?</title>

Abstract: Blockchain address poisoning is an emerging phishing attack that crafts "similar-looking" transfer records in the victim's transaction history, which aims to deceive victims and lure them into mistakenly transferring funds to the attacker. Recent works have shown that millions of Ethereum users were targeted and lost over 100 million US dollars.
  Ethereum crypto wallets, serving users in browsing transaction history and initiating transactions to transfer funds, play a central role in deploying countermeasures to mitigate the address poisoning attack. However, whether they have done so remains an open question. To fill the research void, in this paper, we design experiments to simulate address poisoning attacks and systematically evaluate the usability and security of 53 popular Ethereum crypto wallets. Our evaluation shows that there exist communication failures between 12 wallets and their transaction activity provider, which renders them unable to download the users' transaction history. Besides, our evaluation also shows that 16 wallets pose a high risk to their users due to displaying fake token phishing transfers. Moreover, our further analysis suggests that most wallets rely on transaction activity providers to filter out phishing transfers. However, their phishing detection capability varies. Finally, we found that only three wallets throw an explicit warning message when users attempt to transfer to the phishing address, implying a significant gap within the broader Ethereum crypto wallet community in protecting users from address poisoning attacks.
  Overall, our work shows that more efforts are needed by the Ethereum crypto wallet developer community to achieve the highest usability and security standard. Our bug reports have been acknowledged by the developer community, who are currently developing mitigation solutions.

Abstract: Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism, while central to achieving decentralized consensus, has long been criticized for excessive energy use and hardware inefficiencies \cite{devries2018bitcoin, truby2018decarbonizing}. This paper introduces a hybrid architecture that replaces Bitcoin's traditional PoW with a centralized, cloud-based collaborative training framework. In this model, miners contribute computing resources to train segments of horizontally scaled machine learning models on preprocessed datasets, ensuring privacy and generating meaningful outputs \cite{li2017securing}. A central server evaluates contributions using two metrics: number of parameters trained and reduction in model loss during each cycle. At the end of every cycle, a weighted lottery selects the winning miner, who receives a digitally signed certificate. This certificate serves as a verifiable substitute for PoW and grants the right to append a block to the blockchain \cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}. By integrating digital signatures and SHA-256 hashing \cite{nist2015sha}, the system preserves blockchain integrity while redirecting energy toward productive computation. The proposed approach addresses the sustainability concerns of traditional mining by converting resource expenditure into socially valuable work, aligning security incentives with real-world computational progress.

Abstract: As blockchain technology advances, Ethereum based gambling decentralized applications (DApps) represent a new paradigm in online gambling. This paper examines the concepts, principles, implementation, and prospects of Ethereum based gambling DApps. First, we outline the concept and operational principles of gambling DApps. These DApps are blockchain based online lottery platforms. They utilize smart contracts to manage the entire lottery process, including issuance, betting, drawing, and prize distribution. Being decentralized, lottery DApps operate without central oversight, unlike traditional lotteries. This ensures fairness and eliminates control by any single entity. Automated smart contract execution further reduces management costs, increases profitability, and enhances game transparency and credibility. Next, we analyze an existing Ethereum based gambling DApp, detailing its technical principles, implementation, operational status, vulnerabilities, and potential solutions. We then elaborate on the implementation of lottery DApps. Smart contracts automate the entire lottery process including betting, drawing, and prize distribution. Although developing lottery DApps requires technical expertise, the expanding Ethereum ecosystem provides growing tools and frameworks, lowering development barriers. Finally, we discuss current limitations and prospects of lottery DApps. As blockchain technology and smart contracts evolve, lottery DApps are positioned to significantly transform the online lottery industry. Advantages like decentralization, automation, and transparency will likely drive broader future adoption.

Abstract: Prompt learning has propelled vision-language models like CLIP to excel in diverse tasks, making them ideal for federated learning due to computational efficiency. However, conventional approaches that rely solely on final-layer features miss out on rich multi-scale visual cues and domain-specific style variations in decentralized client data. To bridge this gap, we introduce FedCSAP (Federated Cross-Modal Style-Aware Prompt Generation). Our framework harnesses low, mid, and high-level features from CLIP's vision encoder alongside client-specific style indicators derived from batch-level statistics. By merging intricate visual details with textual context, FedCSAP produces robust, context-aware prompt tokens that are both distinct and non-redundant, thereby boosting generalization across seen and unseen classes. Operating within a federated learning paradigm, our approach ensures data privacy through local training and global aggregation, adeptly handling non-IID class distributions and diverse domain-specific styles. Comprehensive experiments on multiple image classification datasets confirm that FedCSAP outperforms existing federated prompt learning methods in both accuracy and overall generalization.

Abstract: Marine oil spills pose grave environmental and economic risks, threatening marine ecosystems, coastlines, and dependent industries. Predicting and managing oil spill trajectories is highly complex, due to the interplay of physical, chemical, and environmental factors such as wind, currents, and temperature, which makes timely and effective response challenging. Accurate real-time trajectory forecasting and coordinated mitigation are vital for minimizing the impact of these disasters. This study introduces an integrated framework combining a multi-agent swarm robotics system built on the MOOS-IvP platform with Liquid Time-Constant Neural Networks (LTCNs). The proposed system fuses adaptive machine learning with autonomous marine robotics, enabling real-time prediction, dynamic tracking, and rapid response to evolving oil spills. By leveraging LTCNs--well-suited for modeling complex, time-dependent processes--the framework achieves real-time, high-accuracy forecasts of spill movement. Swarm intelligence enables decentralized, scalable, and resilient decision-making among robot agents, enhancing collective monitoring and containment efforts. Our approach was validated using data from the Deepwater Horizon spill, where the LTC-RK4 model achieved 0.96 spatial accuracy, surpassing LSTM approaches by 23%. The integration of advanced neural modeling with autonomous, coordinated robotics demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction precision, flexibility, and operational scalability. Ultimately, this research advances the state-of-the-art for sustainable, autonomous oil spill management and environmental protection by enhancing both trajectory prediction and response coordination.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to train a model collaboratively without sharing local data. A key distinction between FL and centralized learning is that clients' data are non-independent and identically distributed, which poses significant challenges in training a global model that generalizes well across heterogeneous local data distributions. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of overparameterized FedAvg with gradient descent (GD). We prove that the impact of data heterogeneity diminishes as the width of neural networks increases, ultimately vanishing when the width approaches infinity. In the infinite-width regime, we further prove that both the global and local models in FedAvg behave as linear models, and that FedAvg achieves the same generalization performance as centralized learning with the same number of GD iterations. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical findings across various network architectures, loss functions, and optimization methods.

<title>MPOCryptoML: Multi-Pattern based Off-Chain Crypto Money Laundering Detection</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in money laundering detection have demonstrated the potential of using graph neural networks to capture laundering patterns accurately. However, existing models are not explicitly designed to detect the diverse patterns of off-chain cryptocurrency money laundering. Neglecting any laundering pattern introduces critical detection gaps, as each pattern reflects unique transactional structures that facilitate the obfuscation of illicit fund origins and movements. Failure to account for these patterns may result in under-detection or omission of specific laundering activities, diminishing model accuracy and allowing schemes to bypass detection. To address this gap, we propose the MPOCryptoML model to effectively detect multiple laundering patterns in cryptocurrency transactions. MPOCryptoML includes the development of a multi-source Personalized PageRank algorithm to identify random laundering patterns. Additionally, we introduce two novel algorithms by analyzing the timestamp and weight of transactions in high-volume financial networks to detect various money laundering structures, including fan-in, fan-out, bipartite, gather-scatter, and stack patterns. We further examine correlations between these patterns using a logistic regression model. An anomaly score function integrates results from each module to rank accounts by anomaly score, systematically identifying high-risk accounts. Extensive experiments on public datasets including Elliptic++, Ethereum fraud detection, and Wormhole transaction datasets validate the efficacy and efficiency of MPOCryptoML. Results show consistent performance gains, with improvements up to 9.13% in precision, up to 10.16% in recall, up to 7.63% in F1-score, and up to 10.19% in accuracy.

<title>DIT: Dimension Reduction View on Optimal NFT Rarity Meters</title>

Abstract: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become a significant digital asset class, each uniquely representing virtual entities such as artworks. These tokens are stored in collections within smart contracts and are actively traded across platforms on Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana blockchains. The value of NFTs is closely tied to their distinctive characteristics that define rarity, leading to a growing interest in quantifying rarity within both industry and academia. While there are existing rarity meters for assessing NFT rarity, comparing them can be challenging without direct access to the underlying collection data. The Rating over all Rarities (ROAR) benchmark addresses this challenge by providing a standardized framework for evaluating NFT rarity. This paper explores a dimension reduction approach to rarity design, introducing new performance measures and meters, and evaluates them using the ROAR benchmark. Our contributions to the rarity meter design issue include developing an optimal rarity meter design using non-metric weighted multidimensional scaling, introducing Dissimilarity in Trades (DIT) as a performance measure inspired by dimension reduction techniques, and unveiling the non-interpretable rarity meter DIT, which demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The emergence of nomadic mobile communication networks for sixth-generation (6G) introduces a paradigm shift in how network infrastructure is conceptualized, deployed, and operated. Unlike traditional fixed systems, Nomadic Networks (NNs) consist of mobile and self-organizing nodes that provide radio infrastructure capabilities in motion. This paper explores the architectural implications of such systems, with a particular focus on the design and evolution of network interfaces. We analyze the requirements for inter-node communication, service discovery, and control delegation in dynamic environments. Furthermore, we examine the regulatory and licensing challenges that arise when infrastructure elements traverse jurisdictional boundaries. Based on current 6G visions and relevant research, we identify limitations in existing architectures and propose a set of interface principles tailored to nomadicity. By synthesizing findings from mobile, non-terrestrial, and organic network domains, this work contributes to the architectural foundation for future nomadic 6G communication systems and outlines directions for interface standardization in decentralized, mobile infrastructures.

Abstract: Connected and automated vehicles generate vast amounts of sensor data daily, raising significant privacy and communication challenges for centralized machine learning approaches in perception tasks. This study presents a decentralized, federated learning framework tailored for traffic sign detection in vehicular networks to enable collaborative model training without sharing raw data. The framework partitioned traffic sign classes across vehicles for specialized local training using lightweight object detectors, aggregated model parameters via algorithms like FedProx, FedAdam and FedAVG in a simulated environment with the Flower framework, and evaluated multiple configurations including varying server rounds, local epochs, client participation fractions, and data distributions. Experiments demonstrated that increasing server rounds from 2 to 20 boosted accuracy from below 0.1 to over 0.8, moderate local epochs (8-10) provided optimal efficiency with accuracies around 0.67, higher client participation fractions enhanced generalization up to 0.83, FedProx outperformed other aggregators in handling heterogeneity, non-IID data distributions reduced performance compared to IID, and training duration primarily scaled with the number of rounds rather than aggregation strategy. We conclude that this federated approach may offer a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for real-world vehicular deployments, potentially guiding future integrations of robust aggregation and communication optimizations to advance intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing local data. However, most existing methods assume identical model architectures across clients, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous real-world environments. To address this, we propose FedUNet, a lightweight and architecture-agnostic FL framework that attaches a U-Net-inspired additive module to each client's backbone. By sharing only the compact bottleneck of the U-Net, FedUNet enables efficient knowledge transfer without structural alignment. The encoder-decoder design and skip connections in the U-Net help capture both low-level and high-level features, facilitating the extraction of clientinvariant representations. This enables cooperative learning between the backbone and the additive module with minimal communication cost. Experiment with VGG variants shows that FedUNet achieves 93.11% accuracy and 92.68% in compact form (i.e., a lightweight version of FedUNet) with only 0.89 MB low communication overhead.

Abstract: The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) promises to transform financial markets by enabling fractional ownership, global accessibility, and programmable settlement of traditionally illiquid assets such as real estate, private credit, and government bonds. While technical progress has been rapid, with over \$25 billion in tokenized RWAs brought on-chain as of 2025, liquidity remains a critical bottleneck. This paper investigates the gap between tokenization and tradability, drawing on recent academic research and market data from platforms such as RWA.xyz. We document that most RWA tokens exhibit low trading volumes, long holding periods, and limited investor participation, despite their potential for 24/7 global markets. Through case studies of tokenized real estate, private credit, and tokenized treasury funds, we present empirical liquidity observations that reveal low transfer activity, limited active address counts, and minimal secondary trading for most tokenized asset classes. Next, we categorize the structural barriers to liquidity, including regulatory gating, custodial concentration, whitelisting, valuation opacity, and lack of decentralized trading venues. Finally, we propose actionable pathways to improve liquidity, ranging from hybrid market structures and collateral-based liquidity to transparency enhancements and compliance innovation. Our findings contribute to the growing discourse on digital asset market microstructure and highlight that realizing the liquidity potential of RWAs requires coordinated progress across legal, technical, and institutional domains.

Abstract: This article introduces a decentralized robust optimization framework for safe multi-agent control under uncertainty. Although stochastic noise has been the primary form of modeling uncertainty in such systems, these formulations might fall short in addressing uncertainties that are deterministic in nature or simply lack probabilistic data. To ensure safety under such scenarios, we employ the concept of robust constraints that must hold for all possible uncertainty realizations lying inside a bounded set. Nevertheless, standard robust optimization approaches become intractable due to the large number or non-convexity of the constraints involved in safe multi-agent control. To address this, we introduce novel robust reformulations that significantly reduce complexity without compromising safety. The applicability of the framework is further broadened to address both deterministic and stochastic uncertainties by incorporating robust chance constraints and distribution steering techniques. To achieve scalability, we derive a distributed approach based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), supported by a convergence study that accounts for the underlying non-convexity. In addition, computational complexity bounds highlighting the efficiency of the proposed frameworks against standard approaches are presented. Finally, the robustness and scalability of the framework is demonstrated through extensive simulation results across diverse scenarios, including environments with nonconvex obstacles and up to 246 agents.

Abstract: In cryptocurrency-based permissionless blockchain networks, the decentralized structure enables any user to join and operate across different regions. The criminal entities exploit it by using cryptocurrency transactions on the blockchain to facilitate activities such as money laundering, gambling, and ransomware attacks. In recent times, different machine learning-based techniques can detect such criminal elements based on blockchain transaction data. However, there is no provision within the blockchain to deal with such elements. We propose a reputation-based methodology for response to the users detected carrying out the aforementioned illicit activities. We select Algorand blockchain to implement our methodology by incorporating it within the consensus protocol. The theoretical results obtained prove the restriction and exclusion of criminal elements through block proposal rejection and attenuation of the voting power as a validator for such entities. Further, we analyze the efficacy of our method and show that it puts no additional strain on the communication resources.

Abstract: Communication overhead is one of the major obstacles to train large deep learning models at scale. Gradient sparsification is a promising technique to reduce the communication volume. However, it is very challenging to obtain real performance improvement because of (1) the difficulty of achieving an scalable and efficient sparse allreduce algorithm and (2) the sparsification overhead. This paper proposes O$k$-Top$k$, a scheme for distributed training with sparse gradients. O$k$-Top$k$ integrates a novel sparse allreduce algorithm (less than 6$k$ communication volume which is asymptotically optimal) with the decentralized parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer, and its convergence is proved. To reduce the sparsification overhead, O$k$-Top$k$ efficiently selects the top-$k$ gradient values according to an estimated threshold. Evaluations are conducted on the Piz Daint supercomputer with neural network models from different deep learning domains. Empirical results show that O$k$-Top$k$ achieves similar model accuracy to dense allreduce. Compared with the optimized dense and the state-of-the-art sparse allreduces, O$k$-Top$k$ is more scalable and significantly improves training throughput (e.g., 3.29x-12.95x improvement for BERT on 256 GPUs).

Abstract: The security of blockchain systems is fundamentally based on the decentralized consensus in which the majority of parties behave honestly, and the content verification process is essential to maintaining the robustness of blockchain systems. However, the phenomenon that a rational verifier may not have the incentive to honestly perform the costly verification, referred to as the Verifier's Dilemma, could incentivize lazy reporting and undermine the fundamental security of blockchain systems, particularly for verification-expensive decentralized AI applications.
  In this paper, we initiate the research with the development of a Byzantine-robust peer prediction framework towards the design of one-phase Bayesian truthful mechanisms for the decentralized verification games among multiple verifiers, incentivizing all verifiers to perform honest verification without access to the ground truth even in the presence of noisy observations, malicious players and inaccurate priors in the verification process, proposing the compactness criteria that ensures such robustness guarantees. With robust incentive guarantees and budget efficiency, our study provides a framework of incentive design for decentralized verification protocols that enhances the security and robustness of the blockchain, decentralized AI, and potentially other decentralized systems.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training while preserving data privacy, yet existing FL benchmarks address relatively simple classification tasks, where each sample is annotated with a one-hot label. However, little attention has been paid to demonstrating an FL benchmark that handles complicated semantics, where each sample encompasses diverse semantic information, such as relations between objects. Because the existing benchmarks are designed to distribute data in a narrow view of a single semantic, managing the complicated \textit{semantic heterogeneity} across clients when formalizing FL benchmarks is non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a benchmark process to establish an FL benchmark with controllable semantic heterogeneity across clients: two key steps are (i) data clustering with semantics and (ii) data distributing via controllable semantic heterogeneity across clients. As a proof of concept, we construct a federated PSG benchmark, demonstrating the efficacy of the existing PSG methods in an FL setting with controllable semantic heterogeneity of scene graphs. We also present the effectiveness of our benchmark by applying robust federated learning algorithms to data heterogeneity to show increased performance. To our knowledge, this is the first benchmark framework that enables federated learning and its evaluation for multi-semantic vision tasks under the controlled semantic heterogeneity. Our code is available at \textit{https://github.com/Seung-B/FL-PSG}.

Abstract: Censorship resistance with short-term inclusion guarantees is an important feature of decentralized systems, missing from many state-of-the-art and even deployed consensus protocols. In leader-based protocols the leader arbitrarily selects the transactions to be included in the new block, and so does a block builder in protocols such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
  In a different line of work, since the redundancy of consensus for implementing distributed payments was formally proven, consensusless protocols have been described in theory and deployed in the real world. This has resulted in blockchains and payment systems that are more efficient, and at the same time avoid the centralized role of a leader or block builder.
  In this report we review existing consensus and consensusless protocols with regard to their censorship-resistance, efficiency, and other properties. Moreover, we present an approach for new constructions with these properties in mind, building on existing leader-based protocols.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a robust distributed paradigm that circumvents the single-point-of-failure and communication bottleneck risks of centralized architectures. However, a significant challenge arises as existing DFL optimization strategies, primarily designed for tasks such as computer vision, fail to address the unique topological information inherent in the local subgraph. Notably, while Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is tailored for graph data, it is predominantly implemented in a centralized server-client model, failing to leverage the benefits of decentralization.To bridge this gap, we propose DFed-SST, a decentralized federated graph learning framework with adaptive communication. The core of our method is a dual-topology adaptive communication mechanism that leverages the unique topological features of each client's local subgraph to dynamically construct and optimize the inter-client communication topology. This allows our framework to guide model aggregation efficiently in the face of heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of DFed-SST, achieving 3.26% improvement in average accuracy over baseline methods.

<title>The Price of Cheaper Data: Measuring the Strategic Inefficiencies in the Post-EIP-4844 Ethereum Market</title>

Abstract: High transaction fees on Ethereum have long hindered its scalability and user adoption. The recent Ethereum EIP-4844 upgrade aims to alleviate the scalability issue by introducing the blob, a new data structure for Layer-2 rollups. Instead of using expensive blockchain storage, blobs provide a cheaper, separate data layer with its own fee market, which drastically lowers data availability costs. This change, while lowering transaction costs, has created a new high-stakes economic game for block builders and rollups. However, the dynamics of this game remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of the post-EIP-4844 ecosystem, leveraging a dataset of 319.5 million transactions, including 1.3 million blob-carrying type-3 transactions. Our analysis demonstrates clear evidence of a structural shift towards the utilization of cheap blobs over expensive transactions for Layer-2 data posting: while average block size grew 2.5 times, the space consumed by expensive transactions in the public mempool shrank from over 150 KB to just 30 KB. Yet, this scalability success masks widespread economic inefficiencies on both sides of the market. On the builder side, 29.48% of blocks containing blobs are constructed sub-optimally, earning less revenue than that could be achieved otherwise. On the rollup side, we identify that flawed submission strategies have led to $186.92$ ETH in direct losses and average inclusion delays of over 19 seconds. Moving beyond characterization, our work offers actionable solutions. For builders, we develop an optimal pricing model derived from a formal first-price auction framework, allowing builders to make provably profitable inclusion decisions. For rollups, we prove that batching multiple blobs into a single transaction is a dominant, utility-maximizing strategy.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate state estimation and opacity verification problems within a decentralized observation architecture. Specifically, we consider a discrete event system whose behavior is recorded by a set of observation sites. These sites transmit the partially ordered sequences of observations that they record to a coordinator whenever a synchronization occurs. To properly analyze the system behavior from the coordinator's viewpoint, we first introduce the notion of a Complete Synchronizing Sequence structure (CSS structure), which concisely captures the state evolution of each system state upon different information provided by the observation sites. Based on the CSS structure, we then construct corresponding current-state and initial-state estimators for offline state estimation at the coordinator. When used to verify state-isolation properties under this decentralized architecture, the use of CSS structure demonstrates a significant reduction in complexity compared with existing approaches in the literature. In particular, we discuss how to verify initial-state opacity at the coordinator, as well as a novel opacity notion, namely current-state-at-synchronization opacity.

Abstract: Inter-robot collisions pose a significant safety risk when multiple robotic arms operate in close proximity. We present an online collision avoidance methodology leveraging 3D convex shape-based High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) to address this issue. While prior works focused on using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for human-robotic arm and single-arm collision avoidance, we explore the problem of collision avoidance between multiple robotic arms operating in a shared space. In our methodology, we utilize the proposed HOCBFs as centralized and decentralized safety filters. These safety filters are compatible with many nominal controllers and ensure safety without significantly restricting the robots' workspace. A key challenge in implementing these filters is the computational overhead caused by the large number of safety constraints and the computation of a Hessian matrix per constraint. We address this challenge by employing numerical differentiation methods to approximate computationally intensive terms. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and real-world experiments with Franka Research 3 robotic arms. The project video is available at this link.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in realworld applications, yet concerns about their fairness persist especially in highstakes domains like criminal justice, education, healthcare, and finance. This paper introduces transparent evaluation protocol for benchmarking the fairness of opensource LLMs using smart contracts on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain (Foundation, 2023). Our method ensures verifiable, immutable, and reproducible evaluations by executing onchain HTTP requests to hosted Hugging Face endpoints and storing datasets, prompts, and metrics directly onchain. We benchmark the Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models on the PISA dataset for academic performance prediction (OECD, 2018), a dataset suitable for fairness evaluation using statistical parity and equal opportunity metrics (Hardt et al., 2016). We also evaluate structured Context Association Metrics derived from the StereoSet dataset (Nadeem et al., 2020) to measure social bias in contextual associations. We further extend our analysis with a multilingual evaluation across English, Spanish, and Portuguese using the Kaleidoscope benchmark (Salazar et al., 2025), revealing cross-linguistic disparities. All code and results are open source, enabling community audits and longitudinal fairness tracking across model versions.

<title>A Robust Pipeline for Differentially Private Federated Learning on Imbalanced Clinical Data using SMOTETomek and FedProx</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents a groundbreaking approach for collaborative health research, allowing model training on decentralized data while safeguarding patient privacy. FL offers formal security guarantees when combined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies, however, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical utility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often present in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these interconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL framework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial experiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data, resulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first integrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek Links (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically useful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using a tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear trade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the optimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal operational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong privacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high clinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a practical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate diagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare data.

Abstract: Federated learning enhances traditional deep learning by enabling the joint training of a model with the use of IoT device's private data. It ensures privacy for clients, but is susceptible to data poisoning attacks during training that degrade model performance and integrity. Current poisoning detection methods in federated learning lack a standardized detection method or take significant liberties with trust. In this paper, we present \Sys, a novel blockchain-enabled poison detection framework in federated learning. The framework decentralizes the role of the global server across participating clients. We introduce a judge model used to detect data poisoning in model updates. The judge model is produced by each client and verified to reach consensus on a single judge model. We implement our solution to show \Sys is robust against data poisoning attacks and the creation of our judge model is scalable.

arXiv:2508.10052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present NetMoniAI, an agentic AI framework for automatic network monitoring and security that integrates decentralized analysis with lightweight centralized coordination. The framework consists of two layers: autonomous micro-agents at each node perform local traffic analysis and anomaly detection. A central controller then aggregates insights across nodes to detect coordinated attacks and maintain system-wide situational awareness. We evaluated NetMoniAI on a local micro-testbed and through NS-3 simulations. Results confirm that the two-tier agentic-AI design scales under resource constraints, reduces redundancy, and improves response time without compromising accuracy. To facilitate broader adoption and reproducibility, the complete framework is available as open source. This enables researchers and practitioners to replicate, validate, and extend it across diverse network environments and threat scenarios. Github link: https://github.com/pzambare3/NetMoniAI

arXiv:2508.10185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital identities are increasingly important for mediating not only digital but also physical service transactions. Managing such identities through centralized providers can cause both availability and privacy concerns: single points of failure and control are ideal targets for global attacks on technical, organizational, or legal fronts. We design, analyze, and build a distributed digital identity architecture for physical world transactions in common scenarios like unlocking doors, public transport, or crossing country borders. This architecture combines (biometric and other) sensors, (established and upcoming) identity authorities, attribute verifiers, and a new core component we call the \emph{Personal Identity Agent (PIA)} that represents individuals with their identity attributes in the digital domain. All transactions are conducted in a completely decentralized manner, and the components for which we currently assume central coordination are optional and only used for assisting with service discovery and latency reduction. We present a first protocol between these parties and formally verify that it achieves relevant security properties based on a realistic threat model including strong global adversaries. A proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates practical feasibility of both architecture and initial protocol for applications that can tolerate end-to-end latencies in the range of a few seconds.

<title>GraphFedMIG: Tackling Class Imbalance in Federated Graph Learning via Mutual Information-Guided Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private, decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information, hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators. By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value, minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

Abstract: The fundamental basis for maintaining integrity within contemporary blockchain systems is provided by authenticated databases. Our analysis indicates that a significant portion of the approaches applied in this domain fail to sufficiently meet the stringent requirements of systems processing transactions at rates of multi-million TPS. AlDBaran signifies a substantial advancement in authenticated databases. By eliminating disk I/O operations from the critical path, implementing prefetching strategies, and refining the update mechanism of the Merkle tree, we have engineered an authenticated data structure capable of handling state updates efficiently at a network throughput of 50 Gbps. This throughput capacity significantly surpasses any empirically documented blockchain throughput, guaranteeing the ability of even the most high-throughput blockchains to generate state commitments effectively.
  AlDBaran provides support for historical state proofs, which facilitates a wide array of novel applications. For instance, the deployment of AlDBaran could enable blockchains that do not currently support state commitments to offer functionalities for light clients and/or implement rollups.
  When benchmarked against alternative authenticated data structure projects, AlDBaran exhibits superior performance and simplicity. In particular, AlDBaran achieves speeds of approximately 48 million updates per second using an identical machine configuration. This characteristic renders AlDBaran an attractive solution for resource-limited environments, as its historical data capabilities can be modularly isolated (and deactivated), which further enhances performance. On consumer-level portable hardware, it achieves approximately 8 million updates/s in an in-memory setting and 5 million updates/s with snapshots at sub-second intervals, illustrating compelling and cost-effective scalability.

<title>Bridging Solidity Evolution Gaps: An LLM-Enhanced Approach for Smart Contract Compilation Error Resolution</title>

Abstract: Solidity, the dominant smart contract language for Ethereum, has rapidly evolved with frequent version updates to enhance security, functionality, and developer experience. However, these continual changes introduce significant challenges, particularly in compilation errors, code migration, and maintenance. Therefore, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the challenges in the Solidity version evolution and reveal that 81.68% of examined contracts encounter errors when compiled across different versions, with 86.92% of compilation errors.
  To mitigate these challenges, we conducted a systematic evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for resolving Solidity compilation errors during version migrations. Our empirical analysis across both open-source (LLaMA3, DeepSeek) and closed-source (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo) LLMs reveals that although these models exhibit error repair capabilities, their effectiveness diminishes significantly for semantic-level issues and shows strong dependency on prompt engineering strategies. This underscores the critical need for domain-specific adaptation in developing reliable LLM-based repair systems for smart contracts.
  Building upon these insights, we introduce SMCFIXER, a novel framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge retrieval with LLM-based repair mechanisms for Solidity compilation error resolution. The architecture comprises three core phases: (1) context-aware code slicing that extracts relevant error information; (2) expert knowledge retrieval from official documentation; and (3) iterative patch generation for Solidity migration. Experimental validation across Solidity version migrations demonstrates our approach's statistically significant 24.24% improvement over baseline GPT-4o on real-world datasets, achieving near-perfect 96.97% accuracy.

<title>A Robust Optimization Approach for Demand Response Participation of Fixed-Frequency Air Conditioners</title>

Abstract: With the continuous increase in the penetration of renewable energy in the emerging power systems, the pressure on system peak regulation has been significantly intensified. Against this backdrop, demand side resources particularly air conditioning loads have garnered considerable attention for their substantial regulation potential and fast response capabilities, making them promising candidates for providing auxiliary peak shaving services. This study focuses on fixed frequency air conditioners (FFACs) and proposes an optimization model and solution method for their participation in demand response (DR) programs. First, a probabilistic response model for FFACs is developed based on the Markov assumption. Second, by sampling this probabilistic model, the aggregate power consumption of an FFAC cluster under decentralized control is obtained. Subsequently, a robust optimization model is formulated to maximize the profit of an aggregator managing the FFAC cluster during DR events, taking into account the aggregated response power. The model explicitly considers temperature uncertainty to ensure user comfort in a robust sense. Finally, leveraging the structure of the proposed model, it is reformulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem and solved using a commercial optimization solver. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution approach.

Abstract: Infrastructure shapes societies and scientific discovery. Traditional scientific infrastructure, often static and fragmented, leads to issues like data silos, lack of interoperability and reproducibility, and unsustainable short-lived solutions. Our current technical inability and social reticence to connect and coordinate scientific research and engineering leads to inefficiencies and impedes progress. With AI technologies changing how we interact with the world around us, there is an opportunity to transform scientific processes. Neuroscience's exponential growth of multimodal and multiscale data, and urgent clinical relevance demand an infrastructure itself learns, coordinates, and improves. Using neuroscience as a stress test, this perspective argues for a paradigm shift: infrastructure must evolve into a dynamic, AI-aligned ecosystem to accelerate science. Building on several existing principles for data, collective benefit, and digital repositories, I recommend operational guidelines for implementing them to create this dynamic ecosystem, aiming to foster a decentralized, self-learning, and self-correcting system where humans and AI can collaborate seamlessly. Addressing the chronic underfunding of scientific infrastructure, acknowledging diverse contributions beyond publications, and coordinating global efforts are critical steps for this transformation. By prioritizing an intelligent infrastructure as a central scientific instrument for knowledge generation, we can overcome current limitations, accelerate discovery, ensure reproducibility and ethical practices, and ultimately translate neuroscientific understanding into tangible societal benefits, setting a blueprint for other scientific domains.

Abstract: Traditional Insurance, a popular approach of financial risk management, has suffered from the issues of high operational costs, opaqueness, inefficiency and a lack of trust. Recently, blockchain-enabled "parametric insurance" through authorized data sources (e.g., remote sensing and IoT) aims to overcome these issues by automating the underwriting and claim processes of insurance policies on a blockchain. However, the openness of blockchain platforms raises a concern of user privacy, as the private user data in insurance claims on a blockchain may be exposed to outsiders. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving parametric insurance framework based on succinct zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs), whereby an insuree submits a zero-knowledge proof (without revealing any private data) for the validity of an insurance claim and the authenticity of its data sources to a blockchain for transparent verification. Moreover, we extend the recent zk-SNARKs to support robust privacy protection for multiple heterogeneous data sources and improve its efficiency to cut the incurred gas cost by 80%. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented a working prototype of bushfire parametric insurance on real-world blockchain platform Ethereum, and present extensive empirical evaluations.

<title>Efficient Parallel Execution of Blockchain Transactions Leveraging Conflict Specifications</title>

Abstract: Parallel execution of smart contract transactions in large multicore architectures is critical for higher efficiency and improved throughput. The main bottleneck for maximizing the throughput of a node through parallel execution is transaction conflict resolution: when two transactions interact with the same data, like an account balance, their order matters. Imagine one transaction sends tokens from account A to account B, and another tries to send tokens from account B to account C. If the second transaction happens before the first one, the token balance in account B might be wrong, causing the entire system to break. Conflicts like these must be managed carefully, or you end up with an inconsistent, unusable blockchain state.
  Traditional software transactional memory (STM) has been identified as a possible abstraction for the concurrent execution of transactions within a block, with Block-STM pioneering its application for efficient blockchain transaction processing on multicore validator nodes. This paper presents a parallel execution methodology that leverages conflict specification information of the transactions for block transactional memory (BTM) algorithms. Our experimental analysis, conducted over synthetic transactional workloads and real-world blocks, demonstrates that BTMs leveraging conflict specifications outperform their plain counterparts on both EVM and MoveVM. Our proposed BTM implementations achieve up to 1.75x speedup over sequential execution and outperform the state-of-the-art Parallel-EVM (PEVM) execution by up to 1.33x across synthetic workloads.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm in which multiple clients collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their local private data. However, real-world applications of FL frequently encounter challenges arising from the non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) local datasets across participating clients, which is particularly pronounced in the field of medical imaging, where shifts in image feature distributions significantly hinder the global model's convergence and performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedMP, a novel method designed to enhance FL under non-IID scenarios. FedMP employs stochastic feature manifold completion to enrich the training space of individual client classifiers, and leverages class-prototypes to guide the alignment of feature manifolds across clients within semantically consistent subspaces, facilitating the construction of more distinct decision boundaries. We validate the effectiveness of FedMP on multiple medical imaging datasets, including those with real-world multi-center distributions, as well as on a multi-domain natural image dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that FedMP outperforms existing FL algorithms. Additionally, we analyze the impact of manifold dimensionality, communication efficiency, and privacy implications of feature exposure in our method.

<title>Long-Term Client Selection for Federated Learning with Non-IID Data: A Truthful Auction Approach</title>

arXiv:2508.09181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a decentralized framework that enables universal model training through collaborative efforts on mobile nodes, such as smart vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Each smart vehicle acts as a mobile client, contributing to the process without uploading local data. This method leverages non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) training data from different vehicles, influenced by various driving patterns and environmental conditions, which can significantly impact model convergence and accuracy. Although client selection can be a feasible solution for non-IID issues, it faces challenges related to selection metrics. Traditional metrics evaluate client data quality independently per round and require client selection after all clients complete local training, leading to resource wastage from unused training results. In the IoV context, where vehicles have limited connectivity and computational resources, information asymmetry in client selection risks clients submitting false information, potentially making the selection ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Long-term Client-Selection Federated Learning based on Truthful Auction (LCSFLA). This scheme maximizes social welfare with consideration of long-term data quality using a new assessment mechanism and energy costs, and the advised auction mechanism with a deposit requirement incentivizes client participation and ensures information truthfulness. We theoretically prove the incentive compatibility and individual rationality of the advised incentive mechanism. Experimental results on various datasets, including those from IoV scenarios, demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating performance degradation caused by non-IID data.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale models, such as large language models (LLMs), incurs substantial costs due to their computational demands. To mitigate these costs and address challenges related to scalability and data security, there is a growing shift towards decentralized systems for model deployment, where choosing efficient inference acceleration schemes become crucial to manage computational resources effectively and enhance system responsiveness. In this work, we address the challenge of selecting optimal acceleration methods in decentralized systems by introducing a meta-learning-based framework. This framework automates the selection process by learning from historical performance data of various acceleration techniques across different tasks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on random selection or expert intuition, our approach systematically identifies the best acceleration strategies based on the specific characteristics of each task. We demonstrate that our meta-learning framework not only streamlines the decision-making process but also consistently outperforms conventional methods in terms of efficiency and performance. Our results highlight the potential of inference acceleration in decentralized AI systems, offering a path towards more democratic and economically feasible artificial intelligence solutions.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of financial technology, the detection of illicit transactions within blockchain networks remains a critical challenge, necessitating robust and innovative solutions. This work proposes a novel approach by combining Quantum Inspired Graph Neural Networks (QI-GNN) with flexibility of choice of an Ensemble Model using QBoost or a classic model such as Random Forrest Classifier. This system is tailored specifically for blockchain network analysis in anti-money laundering (AML) efforts. Our methodology to design this system incorporates a novel component, a Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition layer within the graph neural network framework, enhancing its capability to process and analyze complex data structures efficiently. Our technical approach has undergone rigorous evaluation against classical machine learning implementations, achieving an F2 score of 74.8% in detecting fraudulent transactions. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired techniques, supplemented by the structural advancements of the CP layer, to not only match but potentially exceed traditional methods in complex network analysis for financial security. The findings advocate for a broader adoption and further exploration of quantum-inspired algorithms within the financial sector to effectively combat fraud.

Abstract: Weather forecasting plays a vital role in disaster preparedness, agriculture, and resource management, yet current centralized forecasting systems are increasingly strained by security vulnerabilities, limited scalability, and susceptibility to single points of failure. To address these challenges, we propose a decentralized weather forecasting framework that integrates Federated Learning (FL) with blockchain technology. FL enables collaborative model training without exposing sensitive local data; this approach enhances privacy and reduces data transfer overhead. Meanwhile, the Ethereum blockchain ensures transparent and dependable verification of model updates. To further enhance the system's security, we introduce a reputation-based voting mechanism that assesses the trustworthiness of submitted models while utilizing the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for efficient off-chain storage. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only improves forecasting accuracy but also enhances system resilience and scalability, making it a viable candidate for deployment in real-world, security-critical environments.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a data-driven scheme within a compositional framework with noisy data to design robust safety controllers in a fully decentralized fashion for large-scale interconnected networks with unknown mathematical dynamics. Despite the network's high dimensionality and the inherent complexity of its unknown model, which make it intractable, our approach effectively addresses these challenges by (i) treating the network as a composition of smaller subsystems, and (ii) collecting noisy data from each subsystem's trajectory to design a control sub-barrier certificate (CSBC) and its corresponding local controller. To achieve this, our proposed scheme only requires a noise-corrupted single input-state trajectory from each unknown subsystem up to a specified time horizon, satisfying a certain rank condition. Subsequently, under a small-gain compositional reasoning, we compose those CSBC, derived from noisy data, and formulate a control barrier certificate (CBC) for the unknown network, ensuring its safety over an infinite time horizon, while providing correctness guarantees. We offer a data-dependent sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program for computing CSBC alongside local controllers of subsystems. We illustrate that while the computational complexity of designing a CBC and its safety controller grows polynomially with network dimension using SOS optimization, our compositional data-driven approach significantly reduces it to a linear scale concerning the number of subsystems. We demonstrate the capability of our data-driven approach on multiple physical networks involving unknown models and a range of interconnection topologies.

<title>Decentralized Rank Scheduling for Energy-Constrained Multi-Task Federated Fine-Tuning in Edge-Assisted IoV Networks</title>

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach for adapting foundation models (FMs) to diverse downstream tasks in edge environments. In Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, enabling efficient and low-latency multi-task adaptation is particularly challenging due to client mobility, heterogeneous resources, and intermittent connectivity. This paper proposes a hierarchical federated fine-tuning framework that coordinates roadside units (RSUs) and vehicles to support resource-aware and mobility-resilient learning across dynamic IoV scenarios. Leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce a decentralized, energy-aware rank adaptation mechanism formulated as a constrained multi-armed bandit problem. A novel UCB-DUAL algorithm is developed to enable adaptive exploration under per-task energy budgets, achieving provable sublinear regret. To evaluate our method, we construct a large-scale IoV simulator based on real-world trajectories, capturing dynamic participation, RSU handoffs, and communication variability. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off among all baselines, reducing latency by over 24\% and improving average accuracy by more than 2.5\%.

Abstract: To protect clients' right to be forgotten in federated learning, federated unlearning aims to remove the data contribution of leaving clients from the global learned model. While current studies mainly focused on enhancing unlearning efficiency and effectiveness, the crucial aspects of efficiency fairness and performance fairness among decentralized clients during unlearning have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce FedShard, the first federated unlearning algorithm designed to concurrently guarantee both efficiency fairness and performance fairness. FedShard adaptively addresses the challenges introduced by dilemmas among convergence, unlearning efficiency, and unlearning fairness. Furthermore, we propose two novel metrics to quantitatively assess the fairness of unlearning algorithms, which we prove to satisfy well-known properties in other existing fairness measurements. Our theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation validate FedShard's fairness in terms of both unlearning performance and efficiency. We demonstrate that FedShard mitigates unfairness risks such as cascaded leaving and poisoning attacks and realizes more balanced unlearning costs among clients. Experimental results indicate that FedShard accelerates the data unlearning process 1.3-6.2 times faster than retraining from scratch and 4.9 times faster than the state-of-the-art exact unlearning methods.

Abstract: The current Internet lacks quality-of-service guarantees for real-time applications like video calls and gaming, cloud-based systems, financial transactions, telesurgery, and other remote applications that benefit from reliable communication. To address this problem, this paper introduces Hummingbird: a novel, lightweight bandwidth-reservation system that provides fine-grained inter-domain reservations for end hosts and introduces several improvements over previous designs.
  Hummingbird enables flexible and composable reservations with end-to-end guarantees, and addresses an often overlooked, but crucial, aspect of bandwidth reservation systems: incentivization of network providers. Hummingbird represents bandwidth reservations as tradeable assets which allows markets to emerge that ensure fair and efficient resource allocation and encourage deployment by remunerating providers. This incentivization is facilitated by decoupling reservations from network identities, which enables novel control-plane mechanisms and allows us to design a control plane based on smart contracts.
  Hummingbird also provides an efficient reservation data plane which streamlines the processing on routers and thus simplifies the implementation, deployment, and traffic policing while maintaining robust security properties.

Abstract: Cellular traffic forecasting is a critical task that enables network operators to efficiently allocate resources and address anomalies in rapidly evolving environments. The exponential growth of data collected from base stations poses significant challenges to processing and analysis. While machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for handling these large datasets and providing accurate predictions, their environmental impact, particularly in terms of energy consumption, is often overlooked in favor of their predictive capabilities. This study investigates the potential of two bio-inspired models: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Reservoir Computing through Echo State Networks (ESNs) for cellular traffic forecasting. The evaluation focuses on both their predictive performance and energy efficiency. These models are implemented in both centralized and federated settings to analyze their effectiveness and energy consumption in decentralized systems. Additionally, we compare bio-inspired models with traditional architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), to provide a comprehensive evaluation. Using data collected from three diverse locations in Barcelona, Spain, we examine the trade-offs between predictive accuracy and energy demands across these approaches. The results indicate that bio-inspired models, such as SNNs and ESNs, can achieve significant energy savings while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to traditional architectures. Furthermore, federated implementations were tested to evaluate their energy efficiency in decentralized settings compared to centralized systems, particularly in combination with bio-inspired models. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential of bio-inspired models for sustainable and privacy-preserving cellular traffic forecasting.

<title>The Illusory Normativity of Rights-Based AI Regulation</title>

Abstract: Whether and how to regulate AI is now a central question of governance. Across academic, policy, and international legal circles, the European Union is widely treated as the normative leader in this space. Its regulatory framework, anchored in the General Data Protection Regulation, the Digital Services and Markets Acts, and the AI Act, is often portrayed as a principled model grounded in fundamental rights. This Article challenges that assumption. We argue that the rights-based narrative surrounding EU AI regulation mischaracterizes the logic of its institutional design. While rights language pervades EU legal instruments, its function is managerial, not foundational. These rights operate as tools of administrative ordering, used to mitigate technological disruption, manage geopolitical risk, and preserve systemic balance, rather than as expressions of moral autonomy or democratic consent. Drawing on comparative institutional analysis, we situate EU AI governance within a longer tradition of legal ordering shaped by the need to coordinate power across fragmented jurisdictions. We contrast this approach with the American model, which reflects a different regulatory logic rooted in decentralized authority, sectoral pluralism, and a constitutional preference for innovation and individual autonomy. Through case studies in five key domains -- data privacy, cybersecurity, healthcare, labor, and disinformation -- we show that EU regulation is not meaningfully rights-driven, as is often claimed. It is instead structured around the containment of institutional risk. Our aim is not to endorse the American model but to reject the presumption that the EU approach reflects a normative ideal that other nations should uncritically adopt. The EU model is best understood as a historically contingent response to its own political conditions, not a template for others to blindly follow.

Abstract: Decentralization is understood both by professionals in the blockchain industry and general users as a core design goal of permissionless ledgers. However, its meaning is far from universally agreed, and often it is easier to get opinions on what it is not, rather than what it is. In this paper, we solicit definitions of 'decentralization' and 'decentralization theatre' from blockchain node operators. Key to a definition is asking about effective decentralization strategies, as well as those that are ineffective, sometimes deliberately so. Malicious, deceptive, or incompetent strategies are commonly referred to by the term 'decentralization theatre.' Finally, we ask what is being decentralized. Via thematic analysis of interview transcripts, we find that most operators conceive decentralization as existing broadly on a technical and a governance axis. Isolating relevant variables, we collapse the categories to network topology and governance topology, or the structure of decision-making power. Our key finding is that `decentralization' alone does not affect ledger immutability or systemic robustness.

Abstract: Actor-critic methods for decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) facilitate collaborative optimal decision making without centralized coordination, thus enabling a wide range of applications in practice. To date, however, most theoretical convergence studies for existing actor-critic decentralized MARL methods are limited to the guarantee of a stationary solution under the linear function approximation. This leaves a significant gap between the highly successful use of deep neural actor-critic for decentralized MARL in practice and the current theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we make the first attempt to develop a deep neural actor-critic method for decentralized MARL, where both the actor and critic components are inherently non-linear. We show that our proposed method enjoys a global optimality guarantee with a finite-time convergence rate of O(1/T), where T is the total iteration times. This marks the first global convergence result for deep neural actor-critic methods in the MARL literature. We also conduct extensive numerical experiments, which verify our theoretical results.

Abstract: The Iterative Forecast Planner (IFP) is a geometric planning approach that offers lightweight computations, scal- able, and reactive solutions for multi-robot path planning in decentralized, communication-free settings. However, it struggles in symmetric configurations, where mirrored interactions often lead to collisions and deadlocks. We introduce eIFP-MPC, an optimized and extended version of IFP that improves robustness and path consistency in dense, dynamic environments. The method refines threat prioritization using a time-to-collision heuristic, stabilizes path generation through cost-based via- point selection, and ensures dynamic feasibility by incorporating model predictive control (MPC) into the planning process. These enhancements are tightly integrated into the IFP to preserve its efficiency while improving its adaptability and stability. Ex- tensive simulations across symmetric and high-density scenarios show that eIFP-MPC significantly reduces oscillations, ensures collision-free motion, and improves trajectory efficiency. The results demonstrate that geometric planners can be strengthened through optimization, enabling robust performance at scale in complex multi-agent environments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers, decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, has been extensively explored in the research community. Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions. Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Collective behaviors such as swarming and flocking emerge from simple, decentralized interactions in biological systems. Existing models, such as Vicsek and Cucker-Smale, lack collision avoidance, whereas the Olfati-Saber model imposes rigid formations, limiting their applicability in swarm robotics. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a minimal yet expressive model that governs agent dynamics using relative positions, velocities, and local density, modulated by two tunable parameters: the spatial offset and kinetic offset. The model achieves spatially flexible, collision-free behaviors that reflect naturalistic group dynamics. Furthermore, we extend the framework to cognitive autonomous systems, enabling energy-aware phase transitions between swarming and flocking through adaptive control parameter tuning. This cognitively inspired approach offers a robust foundation for real-world applications in multi-robot systems, particularly autonomous aerial swarms.

Abstract: Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) represent a promising technology that enables diverse underwater applications through acoustic communication. However, it encounters significant challenges including harsh communication environments, limited energy supply, and restricted signal transmission. This paper aims to provide efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with limited energy and communication resources by optimizing the scheduling of communication links and adjusting transmission parameters (e.g., transmit power and transmission rate). The efficient and reliable communication multi-objective optimization problem (ERCMOP) is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). A Traffic Load-Aware Resource Management (TARM) strategy based on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is presented to address this problem. Specifically, a traffic load-aware mechanism that leverages the overhear information from neighboring nodes is designed to mitigate the disparity between partial observations and global states. Moreover, by incorporating a solution space optimization algorithm, the number of candidate solutions for the deep MARL-based decision-making model can be effectively reduced, thereby optimizing the computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the adaptability of TARM in various scenarios with different transmission demands and collision probabilities, while also validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in supporting efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with limited resources.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML) framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation, our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant statistical heterogeneity across clients.

Abstract: The exponential growth of IoT data demands efficient, secure, and scalable storage solutions on one hand, and efficient data migration and retrieval on the other hand are essential for the systems to be practical and acceptable for different applications. The traditional cloud-based models face latency, security, and high operational costs, while existing bi-directional data storage and retrieval-based IPFS models are not computationally efficient and incur high gas costs at the cost of a necessary blockchain deployment. To overcome the challenges of efficient data migration, we initially developed a 2-way data storage and retrieval system as well as a scalable framework that dynamically monitors and transfers device-generated data to IPFS, records the content identifier(CID) on a blockchain, and enables secure, real-time access via smart contracts. Experimental results demonstrate that the existing work achieved an average data upload time of 117.12 sec for a file size of 500 MB; our framework achieves a faster upload time of 7.63 sec, marking a 93.47% improvement. We further optimize the proposed framework to reduce the file upload time incurred from the smart contracts by introducing a blockchain-inspired, lightweight, and customizable Python framework that replicates the storage and retrieval functionalities of a traditional blockchain, where the file upload time is 4.2 sec, further optimized by 45% from our previous approach, thus demonstrating its efficiency, security and suitability for deploy ment in real-time and critical IoT applications and outperforming the existing IPFS-smart contract based solutions.

Abstract: Blockchains are widely recognized for their immutability, which provides robust guarantees of data integrity and transparency. However, this same feature poses significant challenges in real-world situations that require regulatory compliance, correction of erroneous data, or removal of sensitive information. Redactable blockchains address the limitations of traditional ones by enabling controlled, auditable modifications to blockchain data, primarily through cryptographic mechanisms such as chameleon hash functions and alternative redaction schemes. This report examines the motivations for introducing redactability, surveys the cryptographic primitives that enable secure edits, and analyzes competing approaches and their shortcomings. Special attention is paid to the practical deployment of redactable blockchains in private settings, with discussions of use cases in healthcare, finance, Internet of drones, and federated learning. Finally, the report outlines further challenges, also in connection with reversible computing, and the future potential of redactable blockchains in building law-compliant, trustworthy, and scalable digital infrastructures.

Abstract: Emergency pharmaceutical logistics during rapid-onset disasters must balance timeliness, legal compliance, and environmental uncertainty. We present a hybrid framework that co-designs quantum-inspired decision dynamics, embedded legal constraints, and blockchain-verified environmental feedback. Candidate routes are modeled as a superposed state whose collapse is governed by entropy modulation-delaying commitment under ambiguity and accelerating resolution when coherent signals emerge. Legal statutes act as real-time projection operators shaping feasible choices, while environmental decoherence cues adjust confidence and path viability. The core engine is situated within a multilevel governance and mechanism design architecture, establishing clear roles, accountability channels, and audit trails. Large-scale simulations in wildfire scenarios demonstrate substantial gains over conventional baselines in latency, compliance, and robustness, while preserving interpretability and fairness adaptation. The resulting system offers a deployable, governance-aware infrastructure where law and physical risk jointly inform emergency routing decisions.

Abstract: While voluntary participation is a key mechanism that enables altruistic punishment to emerge, its explanatory power typically rests on the common assumption that non-participants have no impact on the public good. Yet, given the decentralized nature of voluntary participation, opting out does not necessarily preclude individuals from influencing the public good. Here, we revisit the role of voluntary participation by allowing non-participants to exert either positive or negative impacts on the public good. Using evolutionary analysis in a well-mixed finite population, we find that positive externalities from non-participants lower the synergy threshold required for altruistic punishment to dominate. In contrast, negative externalities raise this threshold, making altruistic punishment harder to sustain. Notably, when non-participants have positive impacts, altruistic punishment thrives only if non-participation is incentivized, whereas under negative impacts, it can persist even when non-participation is discouraged. Our findings reveal that efforts to promote altruistic punishment must account for the active role of non-participants, whose influence can make or break collective outcomes.

Abstract: Open-weight AI systems offer unique benefits, including enhanced transparency, open research, and decentralized access. However, they are vulnerable to tampering attacks which can efficiently elicit harmful behaviors by modifying weights or activations. Currently, there is not yet a robust science of open-weight model risk management. Existing safety fine-tuning methods and other post-training techniques have struggled to make LLMs resistant to more than a few dozen steps of adversarial fine-tuning. In this paper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from training data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more tamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable data filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for minimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple 6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial resistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M tokens of biothreat-related text -- outperforming existing post-training baselines by over an order of magnitude -- with no observed degradation to unrelated capabilities. However, while filtered models lack internalized dangerous knowledge, we find that they can still leverage such information when it is provided in context (e.g., via search tool augmentation), demonstrating a need for a defense-in-depth approach. Overall, these findings help to establish pretraining data curation as a promising layer of defense for open-weight AI systems.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been recently utilized in multi-access edge computing (MEC) as edge servers. It is desirable to design UAVs' trajectories and user to UAV assignments to ensure satisfactory service to the users and energy efficient operation simultaneously. The posed optimization problem is challenging to solve because: (i) The formulated problem is non-convex, (ii) Due to the mobility of ground users, their future positions and channel gains are not known in advance, (iii) Local UAVs' observations should be communicated to a central entity that solves the optimization problem. The (semi-) centralized processing leads to communication overhead, communication/processing bottlenecks, lack of flexibility and scalability, and loss of robustness to system failures. To simultaneously address all these limitations, we advocate a fully decentralized setup with no centralized entity. Each UAV obtains its local observation and then communicates with its immediate neighbors only. After sharing information with neighbors, each UAV determines its next position via a locally run deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. None of the UAVs need to know the global communication graph. Two main components of our proposed solution are (i) Graph attention layers (GAT), and (ii) Experience and parameter sharing proximal policy optimization (EPS-PPO). Our proposed approach eliminates all the limitations of semi-centralized MADRL methods such as MAPPO and MA deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), while guaranteeing a better performance than independent local DRLs such as in IPPO. Numerical results reveal notable performance gains in several different criteria compared to the existing MADDPG algorithm, demonstrating the potential for offering a better performance, while utilizing local communications only.

Abstract: With wireless devices increasingly forming a unified smart network for seamless, user-friendly operations, random access (RA) medium access control (MAC) design is considered a key solution for handling unpredictable data traffic from multiple terminals. However, it remains challenging to design an effective RA-based MAC protocol to minimize collisions and ensure transmission fairness across the devices. While existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) have been proposed to optimize RA performance, their reliance on centralized training and the significant overhead required for information collection can make real-world applications unrealistic. In this work, we adopt a fully decentralized MARL architecture, where policy learning does not rely on centralized tasks but leverages consensus-based information exchanges across devices. We design our MARL algorithm over an actor-critic (AC) network and propose exchanging only local rewards to minimize communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical proof of global convergence for our approach. Numerical experiments show that our proposed MARL algorithm can significantly improve RA network performance compared to other baselines.

<title>ScamDetect: Towards a Robust, Agnostic Framework to Uncover Threats in Smart Contracts</title>

Abstract: Smart contracts have transformed decentralized finance by enabling programmable, trustless transactions. However, their widespread adoption and growing financial significance have attracted persistent and sophisticated threats, such as phishing campaigns and contract-level exploits. Traditional transaction-based threat detection methods often expose sensitive user data and interactions, raising privacy and security concerns. In response, static bytecode analysis has emerged as a proactive mitigation strategy, identifying malicious contracts before they execute harmful actions.Building on this approach, we introduced PhishingHook, the first machine-learning-based framework for detecting phishing activities in smart contracts via static bytecode and opcode analysis, achieving approximately 90% detection accuracy. Nevertheless, two pressing challenges remain: (1) the increasing use of sophisticated bytecode obfuscation techniques designed to evade static analysis, and (2) the heterogeneity of blockchain environments requiring platform-agnostic solutions.This paper presents a vision for ScamDetect (Smart Contract Agnostic Malware Detector), a robust, modular, and platform-agnostic framework for smart contract malware detection. Over the next 2.5 years, ScamDetect will evolve in two stages: first, by tackling obfuscated Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode through graph neural network (GNN) analysis of control flow graphs (CFGs), leveraging GNNs' ability to capture complex structural patterns beyond opcode sequences; and second, by generalizing detection capabilities to emerging runtimes such as WASM. ScamDetect aims to enable proactive, scalable security for the future of decentralized ecosystems.

<title>AerialDB: A Federated Peer-to-Peer Spatio-temporal Edge Datastore for Drone Fleets</title>

Abstract: Recent years have seen an unprecedented growth in research that leverages the newest computing paradigm of Internet of Drones, comprising a fleet of connected Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) used for a wide range of tasks such as monitoring and analytics in highly mobile and changing environments characteristic of disaster regions. Given that the typical data (i.e., videos and images) collected by the fleet of UAVs deployed in such scenarios can be considerably larger than what the onboard computers can process, the UAVs need to offload their data in real-time to the edge and the cloud for further processing. To that end, we present the design of AerialDB - a lightweight decentralized data storage and query system that can store and process time series data on a multi-UAV system comprising: A) a fleet of hundreds of UAVs fitted with onboard computers, and B) ground-based edge servers connected through a cellular link. Leveraging lightweight techniques for content-based replica placement and indexing of shards, AerialDB has been optimized for efficient processing of different possible combinations of typical spatial and temporal queries performed by real-world disaster management applications. Using containerized deployment spanning up to 400 drones and 80 edges, we demonstrate that AerialDB is able to scale efficiently while providing near real-time performance with different realistic workloads. Further, AerialDB comprises a decentralized and locality-aware distributed execution engine which provides graceful degradation of performance upon edge failures with relatively low latency while processing large spatio-temporal data. AerialDB exhibits comparable insertion performance and 100 times improvement in query performance against state-of-the-art baseline. Moreover, it exhibits a 10 times and 100 times improvement with insertion and query workloads respectively over the cloud baseline.

Abstract: The inefficiency of selfish routing in congested networks is a classical problem in algorithmic game theory, often captured by the Price of Anarchy (i.e., the ratio between the social cost of decentralized decisions and that of a centrally optimized solution.) With the advent of autonomous vehicles, capable of receiving and executing centrally assigned routes, it is natural to ask whether their deployment can eliminate this inefficiency. At first glance, a central authority could simply compute an optimal traffic assignment and instruct each vehicle to follow its assigned path. However, this vision overlooks critical challenges: routes must be individually rational (no vehicle has an incentive to deviate), and in practice, multiple planning agents (e.g., different companies) may coexist and compete. Surprisingly, we show that such competition is not merely an obstacle but a necessary ingredient for achieving optimal outcomes. In this work, we design a routing mechanism that embraces competition and converges to an optimal assignment, starting from the classical Pigou network as a foundational case.

Abstract: We argue that the technical foundations of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) remain inadequately understood. Prior research has focused on market dynamics, user behavior, and isolated security incidents, yet systematic analysis of the standards underpinning NFT functionality is largely absent.
  We present the first study of NFTs through the lens of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of 191 NFT-related EIPs and 10K+ Ethereum Magicians discussions (as of July, 2025). We integrate multi-dimensional analyses including the automated parsing of Solidity interfaces, graph-based modeling of inheritance structures, contributor profiling, and mining of community discussion data. We distinguish foundational from emerging standards, expose poor cross-version interoperability, and show that growing functional complexity heightens security risks.

<title>On the Efficiency of Dynamic Transaction Scheduling in Blockchain Sharding</title>

Abstract: Sharding is a technique to speed up transaction processing in blockchains, where the $n$ processing nodes in the blockchain are divided into $s$ disjoint groups (shards) that can process transactions in parallel. We study dynamic scheduling problems on a shard graph $G_s$ where transactions arrive online over time and are not known in advance. Each transaction may access at most $k$ shards, and we denote by $d$ the worst distance between a transaction and its accessing (destination) shards (the parameter $d$ is unknown to the shards). To handle different values of $d$, we assume a locality sensitive decomposition of $G_s$ into clusters of shards, where every cluster has a leader shard that schedules transactions for the cluster. We first examine the simpler case of the stateless model, where leaders are not aware of the current state of the transaction accounts, and we prove a $O(d \log^2 s \cdot \min\{k, \sqrt{s}\})$ competitive ratio for latency. We then consider the stateful model, where leader shards gather the current state of accounts, and we prove a $O(\log s\cdot \min\{k, \sqrt{s}\}+\log^2 s)$ competitive ratio for latency. Each leader calculates the schedule in polynomial time for each transaction that it processes. We show that for any $\epsilon > 0$, approximating the optimal schedule within a $(\min\{k, \sqrt{s}\})^{1 -\epsilon}$ factor is NP-hard. Hence, our bound for the stateful model is within a poly-log factor from the best possibly achievable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish provably efficient dynamic scheduling algorithms for blockchain sharding systems.

<title>Enhancing Privacy in Decentralized Min-Max Optimization: A Differentially Private Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07505</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized min-max optimization allows multi-agent systems to collaboratively solve global min-max optimization problems by facilitating the exchange of model updates among neighboring agents, eliminating the need for a central server. However, sharing model updates in such systems carry a risk of exposing sensitive data to inference attacks, raising significant privacy concerns. To mitigate these privacy risks, differential privacy (DP) has become a widely adopted technique for safeguarding individual data. Despite its advantages, implementing DP in decentralized min-max optimization poses challenges, as the added noise can hinder convergence, particularly in non-convex scenarios with complex agent interactions in min-max optimization problems. In this work, we propose an algorithm called DPMixSGD (Differential Private Minmax Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Descent), a novel privacy-preserving algorithm specifically designed for non-convex decentralized min-max optimization. Our method builds on the state-of-the-art STORM-based algorithm, one of the fastest decentralized min-max solutions. We rigorously prove that the noise added to local gradients does not significantly compromise convergence performance, and we provide theoretical bounds to ensure privacy guarantees. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive experiments across various tasks and models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) is critical for dense 5G and beyond deployments, especially in mmWave bands where fiber backhaul is infeasible. We propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for joint link scheduling and resource slicing in dynamic, interference-prone IAB networks. Our method integrates a greedy Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) scheduler to activate access and backhaul links based on traffic and topology, with a multi-agent DDQN allocator for bandwidth and antenna assignment across network slices. This decentralized approach respects strict antenna constraints and supports concurrent scheduling across heterogeneous links. Evaluations across 96 dynamic topologies show 99.84 percent scheduling accuracy and 20.90 percent throughput improvement over baselines. The framework's efficient operation and adaptability make it suitable for dynamic and resource-constrained deployments, where fast link scheduling and autonomous backhaul coordination are vital.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing local data, thereby enhancing privacy and facilitating collaboration among clients connected via social networks. However, these social connections introduce privacy externalities: a client's privacy loss depends not only on its privacy protection strategy but also on the privacy decisions of others, propagated through the network via multi-hop interactions. In this work, we propose a socially-aware privacy-preserving FL mechanism that systematically quantifies indirect privacy leakage through a multi-hop propagation model. We formulate the server-client interaction as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the server, as the leader, optimizes incentive policies, and clients, as followers, strategically select their privacy budgets, which determine their privacy-preserving levels by controlling the magnitude of added noise. To mitigate information asymmetry in networked privacy estimation, we introduce a mean-field estimator to approximate the average external privacy risk. We theoretically prove the existence and convergence of the fixed point of the mean-field estimator and derive closed-form expressions for the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium. Despite being designed from a client-centric incentive perspective, our mechanism achieves approximately-optimal social welfare, as revealed by Price of Anarchy (PoA) analysis. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves client utilities and reduces server costs while maintaining model performance, outperforming both Social-Agnostic (SA) baselines and methods that account for social externalities.

<title>IPBA: Imperceptible Perturbation Backdoor Attack in Federated Self-Supervised Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated self-supervised learning (FSSL) combines the advantages of decentralized modeling and unlabeled representation learning, serving as a cutting-edge paradigm with strong potential for scalability and privacy preservation. Although FSSL has garnered increasing attention, research indicates that it remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing methods generally rely on visually obvious triggers, which makes it difficult to meet the requirements for stealth and practicality in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose an imperceptible and effective backdoor attack method against FSSL, called IPBA. Our empirical study reveals that existing imperceptible triggers face a series of challenges in FSSL, particularly limited transferability, feature entanglement with augmented samples, and out-of-distribution properties. These issues collectively undermine the effectiveness and stealthiness of traditional backdoor attacks in FSSL. To overcome these challenges, IPBA decouples the feature distributions of backdoor and augmented samples, and introduces Sliced-Wasserstein distance to mitigate the out-of-distribution properties of backdoor samples, thereby optimizing the trigger generation process. Our experimental results on several FSSL scenarios and datasets show that IPBA significantly outperforms existing backdoor attack methods in performance and exhibits strong robustness under various defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are typically trained to synthesize data, from images and more recently tabular data, under the assumption of directly accessible training data. Recently, federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that features decentralized learning on client's local data with a privacy-preserving capability. And, while learning GANs to synthesize images on FL systems has just been demonstrated, it is unknown if GANs for tabular data can be learned from decentralized data sources. Moreover, it remains unclear which distributed architecture suits them best. Different from image GANs, state-of-the-art tabular GANs require prior knowledge on the data distribution of each (discrete and continuous) column to agree on a common encoding -- risking privacy guarantees. In this paper, we propose Fed-TGAN, the first Federated learning framework for Tabular GANs. To effectively learn a complex tabular GAN on non-identical participants, Fed-TGAN designs two novel features: (i) a privacy-preserving multi-source feature encoding for model initialization; and (ii) table similarity aware weighting strategies to aggregate local models for countering data skew. We extensively evaluate the proposed Fed-TGAN against variants of decentralized learning architectures on four widely used datasets. Results show that Fed-TGAN accelerates training time per epoch up to 200% compared to the alternative architectures, for both IID and Non-IID data. Overall, Fed-TGAN not only stabilizes the training loss, but also achieves better similarity between generated and original data. Our code is released at https://github.com/zhao-zilong/Fed-TGAN.

<title>A Communication Consistent Approach to Signal Temporal Logic Task Decomposition in Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of decomposing a global task assigned to a multi-agent system, expressed as a formula within a fragment of Signal Temporal Logic (STL), under range-limited communication. Given a global task expressed as a conjunction of local tasks defined over the individual and relative states of agents in the system, we propose representing task dependencies among agents as edges of a suitably defined task graph. At the same time, range-limited communication naturally induces the definition of a communication graph that defines which agents have access to each other's states. Within these settings, inconsistencies arise when a task dependency between a pair of agents is not supported by a corresponding communication link due to the limited communication range. As a result, state feedback control laws previously derived to achieve the tasks' satisfaction can not be leveraged. We propose a task decomposition mechanism to distribute tasks assigned to pairs of non-communicating agents in the system as conjunctions of tasks defined over the relative states of communicating agents, thus enforcing consistency between task and communication graphs. Assuming the super-level sets of the predicate functions composing the STL tasks are bounded polytopes, our task decomposition mechanism can be cast as a parameter optimization problem and solved via state-of-the-art decentralized convex optimization algorithms. To guarantee the soundness of our approach, we present various conditions under which the tasks defined in the applied STL fragment are unsatisfiable, and we show sufficient conditions such that our decomposition approach yields satisfiable global tasks after decomposition.

Abstract: The Metaverse represents a transformative shift beyond traditional mobile Internet, creating an immersive, persistent digital ecosystem where users can interact, socialize, and work within 3D virtual environments. Powered by large models such as ChatGPT and Sora, the Metaverse benefits from precise large-scale real-world modeling, automated multimodal content generation, realistic avatars, and seamless natural language understanding, which enhance user engagement and enable more personalized, intuitive interactions. However, challenges remain, including limited scalability, constrained responsiveness, and low adaptability in dynamic environments. This paper investigates the integration of large models within the Metaverse, examining their roles in enhancing user interaction, perception, content creation, and service quality. To address existing challenges, we propose a generative AI-based framework for optimizing Metaverse rendering. This framework includes a cloud-edge-end collaborative model to allocate rendering tasks with minimal latency, a mobility-aware pre-rendering mechanism that dynamically adjusts to user movement, and a diffusion model-based adaptive rendering strategy to fine-tune visual details. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing rendering efficiency and reducing rendering overheads, advancing large model deployment for a more responsive and immersive Metaverse.

Abstract: Consider a decentralized partially-observed Markov decision problem (POMDP) with multiple cooperative agents aiming to maximize a long-term-average reward criterion. We observe that the availability, at a fixed rate, of entangled states of a product quantum system between the agents, where each agent has access to one of the component systems, can result in strictly improved performance even compared to the scenario where common randomness is provided to the agents, i.e. there is a quantum advantage in decentralized control. This observation comes from a simple reinterpretation of the conclusions of the well-known Mermin-Peres square, which underpins the Mermin-Peres game. While quantum advantage has been demonstrated earlier in one-shot team problems of this kind, it is notable that there are examples where there is a quantum advantage for the one-shot criterion but it disappears in the dynamical scenario. The presence of a quantum advantage in dynamical scenarios is thus seen to be a novel finding relative to the current state of knowledge about the achievable performance in decentralized control problems.

Abstract: The current Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure faces critical vulnerabilities including poisoning attacks, censorship mechanisms, and centralized points of failure that compromise internet freedom and security. Recent incidents such as DNS poisoning attacks on ISP customers highlight the urgent need for resilient alternatives. This paper presents a novel blockchain-based Decentralized Domain Name System (DDNS). We designed a specialized Proof-of-Work blockchain to maximize support for DNS-related protocols and achieve node decentralization. The system integrates our blockchain with IPFS for distributed storage, implements cryptographic primitives for end-to-end trust signatures, and achieves Never Trust, Always Verify zero-trust verification. Our implementation achieves 15-second domain record propagation times, supports 20 standard DNS record types, and provides perpetual free .ddns domains. The system has been deployed across distributed infrastructure in San Jose, Los Angeles, and Orange County, demonstrating practical scalability and resistance to traditional DNS manipulation techniques. Performance evaluation shows the system can handle up to Max Theor. TPS 1,111.1 tx/s (minimal transactions) and Max Theor. TPS 266.7 tx/s (regular transactions) for domain operations while maintaining sub-second query resolution through intelligent caching mechanisms.

Abstract: Blockchain technology offers a promising foundation for modernizing E-Voting systems by enhancing transparency, decentralization, and security. Yet, real-world adoption remains limited due to persistent challenges such as scalability constraints, high computational demands, and complex privacy requirements. This paper presents a comparative framework for analyzing blockchain-based E-Voting architectures, consensus mechanisms, and cryptographic protocols. We examine the limitations of prevalent models like Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake, and propose optimization strategies that include hybrid consensus, lightweight cryptography, and decentralized identity management. Additionally, we explore the novel role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in smart contract generation, anomaly detection, and user interaction. Our findings offer a foundation for designing secure, scalable, and intelligent blockchain-based E-Voting systems suitable for national-scale deployment. This work lays the groundwork for building an end-to-end blockchain E-Voting prototype enhanced by LLM-guided smart contract generation and validation, supported by a systematic framework and simulation-based analysis.

<title>An Overlapping Coalition Game Approach for Collaborative Block Mining and Edge Task Offloading in MEC-assisted Blockchain Networks</title>

Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology that enhances the efficiency of mobile blockchain networks, by enabling miners, often acted by mobile users (MUs) with limited computing resources, to offload resource-intensive mining tasks to nearby edge computing servers. Collaborative block mining can further boost mining efficiency by allowing multiple miners to form coalitions, pooling their computing resources and transaction data together to mine new blocks collaboratively. Therefore, an MEC-assisted collaborative blockchain network can leverage the strengths of both technologies, offering improved efficiency, security, and scalability for blockchain systems. While existing research in this area has mainly focused on the single-coalition collaboration mode, where each miner can only join one coalition, this work explores a more comprehensive multi-coalition collaboration mode, which allows each miner to join multiple coalitions. To analyze the behavior of miners and the edge computing service provider (ECP) in this scenario, we propose a novel two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the ECP, as the leader, determines the prices of computing resources for all MUs. In Stage II, each MU decides the coalitions to join, resulting in an overlapping coalition formation (OCF) game; Subsequently, each coalition decides how many edge computing resources to purchase from the ECP, leading to an edge resource competition (ERC) game. We derive the closed-form Nash equilibrium for the ERC game, based on which we further propose an OCF-based alternating algorithm to achieve a stable coalition structure for the OCF game and develop a near-optimal pricing strategy for the ECP's resource pricing problem.

Abstract: This paper introduces a structural game-theoretic model to value decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin. Instead of relying on speculative beliefs, it frames the asset's price within a Rational-Expectations Security-Utility Nash Equilibrium (RESUNE). This equilibrium is a fixed point where the market-clearing price dictates the hash rate through a free-entry mining model, which in turn endogenously sets the network's security. The security, defined as one minus the probability of a 51% attack, is determined via a global games model of attacker coordination, providing a unique and continuous security function. We prove the existence of a RESUNE and offer conditions for its uniqueness and stability. The model predicts that the stabilizing direct effect of price on demand must outweigh the potentially destabilizing feedback from price to security. The framework generates testable predictions, such as a protocol halving causing a contraction in both hash rate and price. A structural Vector Autoregression (VAR) model is proposed to test this mechanism. The model decomposes Bitcoin's value into transactional utility, security, and speculative components and explains the observed unidirectional causality from price to hash rate.

Abstract: Smart contracts enable contract terms to be automatically executed and verified on the blockchain, and recent years have witnessed numerous applications of them in areas such as financial institutions and supply chains. The execution logic of a smart contract is closely related to the contract state, and thus the correct and safe execution of the contract depends heavily on the precise control and update of the contract state. However, the contract state update process can have issues. In particular, inconsistent state update issues can arise for reasons such as unsynchronized modifications. Inconsistent state update bugs have been exploited by attackers many times, but existing detection tools still have difficulty in effectively identifying them. This paper conducts the first large-scale empirical study about inconsistent state update vulnerabilities (that is, inconsistent state update bugs that are exploitable) in smart contracts, aiming to shed light for developers, researchers, tool builders, and language or library designers in order to avoid inconsistent state update vulnerabilities. We systematically investigate 116 inconsistent state update vulnerabilities in 352 real-world smart contract projects, summarizing their root causes, fix strategies, and exploitation methods. Our study provides 11 original and important findings, and we also give the implications of our findings. To illustrate the potential benefits of our research, we also develop a proof-of-concept checker based on one of our findings. The checker effectively detects issues in 64 popular GitHub projects, and 19 project owners have confirmed the detected issues at the time of writing. The result demonstrates the usefulness and importance of our findings for avoiding inconsistent state update vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

<title>FedX: Explanation-Guided Pruning for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning in Remote Sensing</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client stores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This makes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image classification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal and privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is the communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model updates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses explanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the size of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages backpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific importance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the central server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients, substantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label scene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene classification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success of FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while enhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both unpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods. The code of FedX will be available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/FedX.

Abstract: The recent rise of renewable energy produced by many decentralized sources yields interesting market design challenges for electrical grids. Balancing supply and demand in such networks is both a temporal and spatial challenge due to capacity constraints. The recent surge in the number of household-owned batteries, especially in regions with rooftop solar adoption, offers mitigation potential but often acts misaligned with grid-level objectives. In fact, the decision to charge or discharge a household-owned battery is a strategic choice by each battery owner governed by selfish incentives. This calls for an analysis from a game-theoretic point of view.
  We initiate this timely research direction by considering a game-theoretic setting where selfish agents strategically charge or discharge their batteries to increase their profit. In particular, we study a Stackelberg-like market model where a third party introduces price incentives, aiming to optimize renewable energy utilization while preserving grid feasibility. For this, we study the existence and the quality of equilibria under various pricing strategies. We find that the existence of equilibria crucially depends on the chosen pricing and that the obtained social welfare varies widely. This calls for more sophisticated market models and pricing mechanisms and opens up a rich field for future research in Algorithmic Game Theory on incentives in renewable energy networks.

Abstract: Blockchain-enabled federated learning (BCFL) addresses fundamental challenges of trust, privacy, and coordination in collaborative AI systems. This chapter provides comprehensive architectural analysis of BCFL systems through a systematic four-dimensional taxonomy examining coordination structures, consensus mechanisms, storage architectures, and trust models. We analyze design patterns from blockchain-verified centralized coordination to fully decentralized peer-to-peer networks, evaluating trade-offs in scalability, security, and performance. Through detailed examination of consensus mechanisms designed for federated learning contexts, including Proof of Quality and Proof of Federated Learning, we demonstrate how computational work can be repurposed from arbitrary cryptographic puzzles to productive machine learning tasks. The chapter addresses critical storage challenges by examining multi-tier architectures that balance blockchain's transaction constraints with neural networks' large parameter requirements while maintaining cryptographic integrity. A technical case study of the TrustMesh framework illustrates practical implementation considerations in BCFL systems through distributed image classification training, demonstrating effective collaborative learning across IoT devices with highly non-IID data distributions while maintaining complete transparency and fault tolerance. Analysis of real-world deployments across healthcare consortiums, financial services, and IoT security applications validates the practical viability of BCFL systems, achieving performance comparable to centralized approaches while providing enhanced security guarantees and enabling new models of trustless collaborative intelligence.

<title>Generative AI and the Future of the Digital Commons: Five Open Questions and Knowledge Gaps</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative AI (GenAI) relies heavily on the digital commons, a vast collection of free and open online content that is created, shared, and maintained by communities. However, this relationship is becoming increasingly strained due to financial burdens, decreased contributions, and misalignment between AI models and community norms. As we move deeper into the GenAI era, it is essential to examine the interdependent relationship between GenAI, the long-term sustainability of the digital commons, and the equity of current AI development practices. We highlight five critical questions that require urgent attention: 1. How can we prevent the digital commons from being threatened by undersupply as individuals cease contributing to the commons and turn to Generative AI for information? 2. How can we mitigate the risk of the open web closing due to restrictions on access to curb AI crawlers? 3. How can technical standards and legal frameworks be updated to reflect the evolving needs of organizations hosting common content? 4. What are the effects of increased synthetic content in open knowledge databases, and how can we ensure their integrity? 5. How can we account for and distribute the infrastructural and environmental costs of providing data for AI training? We emphasize the need for more responsible practices in AI development, recognizing the digital commons not only as content but as a collaborative and decentralized form of knowledge governance, which relies on the practice of "commoning" - making, maintaining, and protecting shared and open resources. Ultimately, our goal is to stimulate discussion and research on the intersection of Generative AI and the digital commons, with the aim of developing an "AI commons" and public infrastructures for AI development that support the long-term health of the digital commons.

Abstract: Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the Average Crossing (AC) algorithm--a fully decentralized mechanism for duplicating RWs to prevent RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis establishes that (i) the RW population remains almost surely bounded under AC and (ii) RW-based stochastic gradient descent remains convergent under AC, even in the presence of Pac-Man, with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings. Furthermore, they uncover a phase transition in the extinction probability as a function of the duplication threshold. We offer theoretical insights by analyzing a simplified variant of the AC, which sheds light on the observed phase transition.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of decentralized consensus optimization over directed graphs with limited communication bandwidth. We introduce a novel decentralized optimization algorithm that combines the Reduced Consensus Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (RC-ALADIN) method with a finite time quantized coordination protocol, enabling quantized information exchange among nodes. Assuming the nodes' local objective functions are $\mu$-strongly convex and simply smooth, we establish global convergence at a linear rate to a neighborhood of the optimal solution, with the neighborhood size determined by the quantization level. Additionally, we show that the same convergence result also holds for the case where the local objective functions are convex and $L$-smooth. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm compares favorably against algorithms in the current literature while exhibiting communication efficient operation.

Abstract: The implementation of accurate nonlinear operators (e.g., sigmoid function) on heterogeneous datasets is a key challenge in privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML). Most existing frameworks approximate it through linear operations, which not only result in significant precision loss but also introduce substantial computational overhead. This paper proposes an efficient, verifiable, and accurate security 2-party logistic regression framework (EVA-S2PLoR), which achieves accurate nonlinear function computation through a subtly secure hadamard product protocol and its derived protocols. All protocols are based on a practical semi-honest security model, which is designed for decentralized privacy-preserving application scenarios that balance efficiency, precision, and security. High efficiency and precision are guaranteed by the asynchronous computation flow on floating point numbers and the few number of fixed communication rounds in the hadamard product protocol, where robust anomaly detection is promised by dimension transformation and Monte Carlo methods. EVA-S2PLoR outperforms many advanced frameworks in terms of precision, improving the performance of the sigmoid function by about 10 orders of magnitude compared to most frameworks. Moreover, EVA-S2PLoR delivers the best overall performance in secure logistic regression experiments with training time reduced by over 47.6% under WAN settings and a classification accuracy difference of only about 0.5% compared to the plaintext model.

<title>Transaction Fee Market Design for Parallel Execution</title>

Abstract: Given the low throughput of blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, scalability - the ability to process an increasing number of transactions - has become a central focus of blockchain research. One promising approach is the parallelization of transaction execution across multiple threads. However, achieving efficient parallelization requires a redesign of the incentive structure within the fee market. Currently, the fee market does not differentiate between transactions that access multiple high-demand storage keys (i.e., unique identifiers for individual data entries) versus a single low-demand one, as long as they require the same computational effort. Addressing this discrepancy is crucial for enabling more effective parallel execution.
  In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between the current fee market and the need for parallel execution by exploring alternative fee market designs. To this end, we propose a framework consisting of two key components: a Gas Computation Mechanism (GCM), which quantifies the load a transaction places on the network in terms of parallelization and computation, measured in units of gas, and a Transaction Fee Mechanism (TFM), which assigns a price to each unit of gas. We additionally introduce a set of desirable properties for a GCM, propose several candidate mechanisms, and evaluate them against these criteria. Our analysis highlights two strong candidates: the weighted area GCM, which integrates smoothly with existing TFMs such as EIP-1559 and satisfies a broad subset of the outlined properties, and the time-proportional makespan GCM, which assigns gas costs based on the context of the entire block's schedule and, through this dependence on the overall execution outcome, captures the dynamics of parallel execution more accurately.

Abstract: The rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has driven interest in blockchain database technology, with smart contracts enabling the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi). However, research has shown that adversaries exploit transaction ordering to extract profits through attacks like front-running, sandwich attacks, and liquidation manipulation. This issue affects blockchain databases in which block proposers have full control over transaction ordering. To address this, a more fair approach to transaction ordering is essential.
  Existing fairness protocols, such as Pompe and Themis, operate on leader-based consensus protocols, which not only suffer from low throughput, but also allow adversaries to manipulate transaction ordering. To address these limitations, we propose FairDAG-AB and FairDAG-RL that run fairness protocols on top of DAG-based consensus protocols, which improve protocol performance in both throughput and fairness quality, leveraging the multi-proposer design and validity of DAG-based consensus protocols.
  We conducted a comprehensive analytical and experimental evaluation of our protocols. The results show that FairDAG-AB and FairDAG-RL outperform the prior fairness protocols in both throughput and fairness quality.

Abstract: Augmentation technologies are undergoing a process of enculturation due to many factors, one being the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), or what the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) terms the AI wave or AI boom. Chapter 3 focuses critical attention on the hyped assumption that sophisticated, emergent, and embodied augmentation technologies will improve lives, literacy, cultures, arts, economies, and social contexts. The chapter begins by discussing the problem of ambiguity with AI terminology, which it aids with a description of the WIPO Categorization of AI Technologies Scheme. It then draws on media and communication studies to explore concepts such as agents, agency, power, and agentive relationships between humans and robots. The chapter focuses on the development of non-human agents in industry as a critical factor in the rise of augmentation technologies. It looks at how marketing communication enculturates future users to adopt and adapt to the technology. Scholars are charting the significant ways that people are drawn further into commercial digital landscapes, such as the Metaverse concept, in post-internet society. It concludes by examining recent claims concerning the Metaverse and augmented reality.

Abstract: Gossip algorithms are pivotal in the dissemination of information within decentralized systems. Consequently, numerous gossip libraries have been developed and widely utilized especially in blockchain protocols for the propagation of blocks and transactions. A well-established library is libp2p, which provides two gossip algorithms: floodsup and gossibsup. These algorithms enable the delivery of published messages to a set of peers. In this work we aim to enhance the performance and reliability of libp2p by introducing OPTIMUMP2P, a novel gossip algorithm that leverages the capabilities of Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) to expedite the dissemination of information in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network while ensuring reliable delivery, even in the presence of malicious actors capable of corrupting the transmitted data. Preliminary research from the Ethereum Foundation has demonstrated the use of RLNC in the significant improvement in the block propagation time [14]. Here we present extensive evaluation results both in simulation and real-world environments that demonstrate the performance gains of OPTIMUMP2P over the Gossipsub protocol.

Abstract: Most social applications, from Twitter to Wikipedia, have rigid one-size-fits-all designs, but building new social applications is both technically challenging and results in applications that are siloed away from existing communities. We present Graffiti, a system that can be used to build a wide variety of personalized social applications with relative ease that also interoperate with each other. People can freely move between a plurality of designs -- each with its own aesthetic, feature set, and moderation -- all without losing their friends or data.
  Our concept of total reification makes it possible for seemingly contradictory designs, including conflicting moderation rules, to interoperate. Conversely, our concept of channels prevents interoperation from occurring by accident, avoiding context collapse.
  Graffiti applications interact through a minimal client-side API, which we show admits at least two decentralized implementations. Above the API, we built a Vue.js plugin, which we use to develop applications similar to Twitter, Messenger, and Wikipedia using only client-side code. Our case studies explore how these and other novel applications interoperate, as well as the broader ecosystem that Graffiti enables.

arXiv:2508.04950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we design two compressed decentralized algorithms for solving nonconvex stochastic optimization under two different scenarios. Both algorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a message-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum acceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is highly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition in a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides, because of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the compression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient.
  For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed decentralized adaptive method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decentralized adaptive stochastic gradient method with compressed communication. For the scenario of data heterogeneity without bounded gradients, our proposal is a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method, which applies a gradient tracking technique to address the challenge of data heterogeneity. Notably, both methods achieve an optimal convergence rate, and they can achieve linear speed up and adopt topology-independent algorithmic parameters within a certain regime of the user-specified error tolerance. Superior empirical performance is observed over state-of-the-art methods on training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Transformers.

<title>HFedATM: Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization via Optimal Transport and Regularized Mean Aggregation</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach where multiple clients collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing their raw data. Despite its effectiveness, conventional FL faces scalability challenges due to excessive computational and communication demands placed on a single central server as the number of participating devices grows. Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks across intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and robustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a critical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data distributions vary significantly across different clients and stations, reducing model performance on unseen target domains. While Federated Domain Generalization (FedDG) methods have emerged to improve robustness to domain shifts, their integration into HFL frameworks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we formally introduce Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization (HFedDG), a novel scenario designed to investigate domain shift within hierarchical architectures. Specifically, we propose HFedATM, a hierarchical aggregation method that first aligns the convolutional filters of models from different stations through Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment and subsequently merges aligned models using a Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean Aggregation. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HFedATM significantly boosts the performance of existing FedDG baselines across multiple datasets and maintains computational and communication efficiency. Moreover, theoretical analyses indicate that HFedATM achieves tighter generalization error bounds compared to standard hierarchical averaging, resulting in faster convergence and stable training behavior.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local. Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of trustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across two datasets shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both centralized baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance, particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.

Abstract: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a promising bio-inspired learning paradigm for its advantage of balancing performance and efficiency and has been increasingly applied to the bio-medical domain. In bio-medical applications, trustworthiness such as replicability and verifiability of the trained learning models is crucial. In this work, we introduce HDCoin, the first proof-of-useful-work blockchain framework for HDC. With HDCoin, we transform the conventional energy-wasteful mining process into a competitive process for developing high accuracy, trustworthy and verifiable hyperdimensional models. We explore four diverse biomedical datasets, and conduct an extensive design-space exploration of key HDC hyperparameters of blockchain miners such as dimensionality, learning rate, and retraining iterations for model performance, adaptive mining difficulty and fairness on proof-of-useful-work.

Abstract: Security bugs and trapdoors in smart contracts have been impacting the Ethereum community since its inception. Conceptually, the 1.45-million Ethereum's contracts form a single "gigantic program" whose behaviors are determined by the complex compositions of contracts. Can programmers be assured that this gigantic program conforms to high-level safety specifications, despite unforeseeable code-level intricacies? Static code verification cannot be faithful to this gigantic program due to its scale and high polymorphism. In this paper, we present a viable approach to achieve this goal. Our technology, called Theorem-Carrying Transactions (TCT), combines the benefits of concrete execution and symbolic proofs. Under the TCT protocol, every transaction carries a theorem that proves its adherence to the specified properties in the invoked contracts, and the runtime system checks the theorem before executing the transaction. Once a theorem is proven, it will be reused for future transactions, so TCT's runtime overhead is minimal. As case studies, we demonstrate that TCT secures token contracts without foreseeing code-level intricacies, such as integer overflow and reentrancy. TCT is also successfully applied to a Uniswap codebase, showcasing a complex decentralized finance (DeFi) scenario. Our evaluation shows a negligible runtime overhead, two orders of magnitude lower than a state-of-the-art approach for runtime checking of contract code safety.

Abstract: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are rapidly gaining importance in privacy-preserving and verifiable computing. ZKPs enable a proving party to prove the truth of a statement to a verifying party without revealing anything else. ZKPs have applications in blockchain technologies, verifiable machine learning, and electronic voting, but have yet to see widespread adoption due to the computational complexity of the proving process. Recent works have accelerated the key primitives of state-of-the-art ZKP protocols on GPU and ASIC. However, the protocols accelerated thus far face one of two challenges: they either require a trusted setup for each application, or they generate larger proof sizes with higher verification costs, limiting their applicability in scenarios with numerous verifiers or strict verification time constraints. This work presents an accelerator, zkSpeed, for HyperPlonk, a state-of-the-art ZKP protocol that supports both one-time, universal setup and small proof sizes for typical ZKP applications in publicly verifiable, consensus-based systems. We accelerate the entire protocol, including two major primitives: SumCheck and Multi-scalar Multiplications (MSMs). We develop a full-chip architecture using 366.46 mm$^2$ and 2 TB/s of bandwidth to accelerate the entire proof generation process, achieving geometric mean speedups of 801$\times$ over CPU baselines.

Abstract: The specification of prior distributions is fundamental in Bayesian inference, yet it remains a significant bottleneck. The prior elicitation process is often a manual, subjective, and unscalable task. We propose a novel framework which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and scale this process. We introduce \texttt{LLMPrior}, a principled operator that translates rich, unstructured contexts such as natural language descriptions, data or figures into valid, tractable probability distributions. We formalize this operator by architecturally coupling an LLM with an explicit, tractable generative model, such as a Gaussian Mixture Model (forming a LLM based Mixture Density Network), ensuring the resulting prior satisfies essential mathematical properties. We further extend this framework to multi-agent systems where Logarithmic Opinion Pooling is employed to aggregate prior distributions induced by decentralized knowledge. We present the federated prior aggregation algorithm, \texttt{Fed-LLMPrior}, for aggregating distributed, context-dependent priors in a manner robust to agent heterogeneity. This work provides the foundation for a new class of tools that can potentially lower the barrier to entry for sophisticated Bayesian modeling.

<title>What Do Agents Think Others Would Do? Level-2 Inverse Games for Inferring Agents' Estimates of Others' Objectives</title>

Abstract: Effectively interpreting strategic interactions among multiple agents requires us to infer each agent's objective from limited information. Existing inverse game-theoretic approaches frame this challenge in terms of a "level-1" inference problem, in which we take the perspective of a third-party observer and assume that individual agents share complete knowledge of one another's objectives. However, this assumption breaks down in decentralized, real-world decision scenarios like urban driving and bargaining, in which agents may act based on conflicting views of one another's objectives. We demonstrate the necessity of inferring agents' heterogeneous estimates of each other's objectives through empirical examples, and by theoretically characterizing the prediction error of level-1 inference on fictitious gameplay data from linear-quadratic games. To address this fundamental issue, we propose a framework for level-2 inference to address the question: "What does each agent believe about all agents' objectives?" We prove that the level-2 inference problem is non-convex even in benign settings like linear-quadratic games, and we develop an efficient gradient-based approach for identifying local solutions. Experiments on a synthetic urban driving example show that our approach uncovers nuanced misalignments that level-1 methods miss.

<title>Advanced DAG-Based Ranking (ADR) Protocol for Blockchain Scalability</title>

Abstract: In the past decade, blockchain has emerged as a promising solution for building secure distributed ledgers and has attracted significant attention. However, current blockchain systems suffer from limited throughput, poor scalability, and high latency. Due to limitations in consensus mechanisms, especially in managing node identities, blockchain is often considered unsuitable for applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper proposes the Advanced DAG-based Ranking (ADR) protocol to enhance blockchain scalability and throughput. ADR employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure where nodes are positioned based on their rankings. Unlike traditional chains, ADR allows honest nodes to write blocks and verify transactions using a DAG-based topology. The protocol follows a three-step approach to secure the network against double-spending and enhance performance. First, it verifies nodes using their public and private keys before granting entry. Second, it builds an advanced DAG ledger enabling block production and transaction validation. Third, a ranking algorithm filters out malicious nodes, ranks the remaining nodes based on performance, and arranges them topologically. This process increases throughput and ensures robust scalability. We evaluated ADR on Amazon EC2 clusters with over 100 nodes, including scenarios with injected malicious nodes. Simulation results demonstrate that ADR significantly improves transaction throughput and network liveness compared to existing DAG-based blockchains such as IOTA and ByteBall, making it well-suited for IoT applications.

Abstract: This article introduces a comprehensive metaverse framework, which is designed for the simulation, emulation, and interaction with wireless systems. The proposed framework integrates core metaverse technologies such as extended reality (XR), digital twins (DTs), artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), blockchain, and advanced 6G networking solutions to create a dynamic, immersive platform for both system development and management. By leveraging XR, users can visualize and engage with complex systems, while DTs enable real-time monitoring and optimization.

Additionally, blockchain ensures secure, decentralized interactions, and 5G/6G networks offer the necessary infrastructure for seamless, low-latency communication. This framework serves as a robust tool for exploring, developing, and optimizing wireless systems, aiming to provide valuable insights into the future of networked environments.

Abstract: As blockchain technology rapidly evolves, researchers face a significant challenge due to diverse and non-standardized simulation parameters, which hinder the replicability and comparability of research methodologies. This paper introduces a Generic Framework for Optimization in Blockchain Simulators (GFOBS), a comprehensive and adaptable solution designed to standardize and optimize blockchain simulations. GFOBS provides a flexible platform that supports various optimization algorithms, variables, and objectives, thereby catering to a wide range of blockchain research needs. The paper's key contributions are threefold: the development of GFOBS as a versatile tool for blockchain simulation optimization; the introduction of an innovative optimization method using warm starting technique; and the proposition of a novel concurrent multiprocessing technique for simultaneous simulation processes. These advancements collectively enhance the efficiency, replicability, and standardization of blockchain simulation experiments.

Abstract: In Sixth Generation (6G) networks, decentralized control in multi-tenant systems is a suggested enabler for autonomous network operations. However, autonomy requires independent rationale decisions be taken by tenants. This rationality can only be underpinned by timely and continuous access to status information. Despite its importance, the questions of what information should be shared, how much should be communicated, and how frequently updates should be dispatched remain open research challenges.
  This manuscript proposes an information bulletin strategy defined around two models of the system descriptor states to address these fundamental questions. The strategy is that queues periodically broadcast these information models to tenants at different time intervals, who may respond by reneging from the queue or jockeying to a more favorable one. The expectation is that over time, the queues adapt their processing rates based on what they learn from the tenant behavior. The objective is to minimize overall delay and the impatience. We formulate for this impatience as an optimization problem, whose analytical solution is intractable. We perform numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the learned queue policy and to assess how closely it approaches optimal conditions.

<title>SelectiveShield: Lightweight Hybrid Defense Against Gradient Leakage in Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training on decentralized data but remains vulnerable to gradient leakage attacks that can reconstruct sensitive user information. Existing defense mechanisms, such as differential privacy (DP) and homomorphic encryption (HE), often introduce a trade-off between privacy, model utility, and system overhead, a challenge that is exacerbated in heterogeneous environments with non-IID data and varying client capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose SelectiveShield, a lightweight hybrid defense framework that adaptively integrates selective homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. SelectiveShield leverages Fisher information to quantify parameter sensitivity, allowing clients to identify critical parameters locally. Through a collaborative negotiation protocol, clients agree on a shared set of the most sensitive parameters for protection via homomorphic encryption. Parameters that are uniquely important to individual clients are retained locally, fostering personalization, while non-critical parameters are protected with adaptive differential privacy noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelectiveShield maintains strong model utility while significantly mitigating gradient leakage risks, offering a practical and scalable defense mechanism for real-world federated learning deployments.

Abstract: Digital ecological art represents an emergent frontier where biological media converge with virtual environments. This study examines the paradigm shift from anthropocentric to plant-centered artistic narratives within the metaverse, contextualizing how digital platforms transform ecological expression. However, current frameworks fail to systematically guide artists in leveraging plant agency for digital symbiosis that transcends human-centered creation. We propose the Biocentric-Creation Transformation Ideology (BCTI) framework and validate it through multimodal case studies spanning bio-art, NFTs, and VR ecosystems (2013-2023). Our analysis reveals: (1) Metaverse ecosystems enable unprecedented plant-algorithm co-creation, with biological artworks increasing by 133% in premier archives (2020 vs 2013); (2) Digital symbiosis manifests through blockchain DAOs where plants govern human-plant collaborations; (3) Algorithmic photosynthesis in VR environments reshapes ecological aesthetics through real-time biodata translation. The BCTI framework advances ecological art theory by systematizing the transition from representation to plant-centered agency, offering artists a blueprint for post-anthropocene creation. This redefines environmental consciousness in virtual realms while establishing new protocols for cross-species digital collaboration.

<title>4-Swap: Achieving Grief-Free and Bribery-Safe Atomic Swaps Using Four Transactions</title>

Abstract: Cross-chain asset exchange is crucial for blockchain interoperability. Existing solutions rely on trusted third parties and risk asset loss, or use decentralized alternatives like atomic swaps, which suffer from grief attacks. Griefing occurs when a party prematurely exits, locking the counterparty's assets until a timelock expires. Hedged Atomic Swaps mitigate griefing by introducing a penalty premium; however, they increase the number of transactions from four (as in Tier Nolan's swap) to six, which in turn introduces new griefing risks. Grief-Free (GF) Swap reduces this to five transactions by consolidating assets and premiums on a single chain. However, no existing protocol achieves grief-free asset exchange in just four transactions.
  This paper presents 4-Swap, the first cross-chain atomic swap protocol that is both grief-free and bribery-safe, while completing asset exchange in just four transactions. By combining the griefing premium and principal into a single transaction per chain, 4-Swap reduces on-chain transactions, leading to faster execution compared to previous grief-free solutions. It is fully compatible with Bitcoin and operates without the need for any new opcodes. A game-theoretic analysis shows that rational participants have no incentive to deviate from the protocol, ensuring robust compliance and security.

Abstract: Inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient are used to inform and motivate policymaking, and are increasingly applied to digital platforms. We analyze how measures fare in pseudonymous settings, as common to internet-based or blockchain-based platforms. One key challenge that arises is the ability of actors to create multiple fake identities under fictitious false names, also known as ``Sybils.'' While some actors may do so to preserve their privacy, we show that this can inadvertently distort inequality metrics. As we show, when using inequality measures that satisfy literature's canonical set of desired properties, the presence of Sybils in an economy implies that it is impossible to properly measure the economy's inequality. Then, we present several classes of Sybil-proof measures that satisfy relaxed versions of the aforementioned desired properties, and, by fully characterizing them, we prove that the structure imposed restricts their ability to assess inequality at a fine-grained level. In addition, we prove that popular inequality metrics, including the famous Gini coefficient, are vulnerable to Sybil manipulations, and examine the dynamics that result in the creation of Sybils, whether in pseudonymous settings or traditional ones.

<title>SoK: Stablecoins for Digital Transformation -- Design, Metrics, and Application with Real World Asset Tokenization as a Case Study</title>

Abstract: Stablecoins have become a foundational component of the digital asset ecosystem, with their market capitalization exceeding 230 billion USD as of May 2025. As fiat-referenced and programmable assets, stablecoins provide low-latency, globally interoperable infrastructure for payments, decentralized finance, DeFi, and tokenized commerce. Their accelerated adoption has prompted extensive regulatory engagement, exemplified by the European Union's Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation, MiCA, the US Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, GENIUS Act, and Hong Kong's Stablecoins Bill. Despite this momentum, academic research remains fragmented across economics, law, and computer science, lacking a unified framework for design, evaluation, and application. This study addresses that gap through a multi-method research design. First, it synthesizes cross-disciplinary literature to construct a taxonomy of stablecoin systems based on custodial structure, stabilization mechanism, and governance. Second, it develops a performance evaluation framework tailored to diverse stakeholder needs, supported by an open-source benchmarking pipeline to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Third, a case study on Real World Asset tokenization illustrates how stablecoins operate as programmable monetary infrastructure in cross-border digital systems. By integrating conceptual theory with empirical tools, the paper contributes: a unified taxonomy for stablecoin design; a stakeholder-oriented performance evaluation framework; an empirical case linking stablecoins to sectoral transformation; and reproducible methods and datasets to inform future research. These contributions support the development of trusted, inclusive, and transparent digital monetary infrastructure.

Abstract: Scaling laws offer a powerful lens to understand complex transactional behaviors in decentralized systems. This study reveals distinctive statistical signatures in the transactional dynamics of ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain by examining over 44 million token transfers between July 2017 and March 2018 (9-month period). Transactions are categorized into four types: EOA--EOA, EOA--SC, SC-EOA, and SC-SC based on whether the interacting addresses are Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) or Smart Contracts (SCs), and analyzed across three equal periods (each of 3 months). To identify universal statistical patterns, we investigate the presence of two canonical scaling laws: power law distributions and temporal Taylor's law (TL). EOA-driven transactions exhibit consistent statistical behavior, including a near-linear relationship between trade volume and unique partners with stable power law exponents ($\gamma \approx 2.3$), and adherence to TL with scaling coefficients ($\beta \approx 2.3$). In contrast, interactions involving SCs, especially SC-SC, exhibit sublinear scaling, unstable power-law exponents, and significantly fluctuating Taylor coefficients (variation in $\beta$ to be $\Delta\beta = 0.51$). Moreover, SC-driven activity displays heavier-tailed distributions ($\gamma < 2$), indicating bursty and algorithm-driven activity. These findings reveal the characteristic differences between human-controlled and automated transaction behaviors in blockchain ecosystems. By uncovering universal scaling behaviors through the integration of complex systems theory and blockchain data analytics, this work provides a principled framework for understanding the underlying mechanisms of decentralized financial systems.

Abstract: City-scale traffic signal control (TSC) involves thousands of heterogeneous intersections with varying topologies, making cooperative decision-making across intersections particularly challenging. Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), which focuses on finding collision-free paths for multiple robots, is crucial for applications ranging from aerial swarms to warehouse automation. Solving MAPF is NP-hard so learning-based approaches for MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep neural networks. Nonetheless, despite the community's continued efforts, all learning-based MAPF planners still rely on decentralized planning due to variability in the number of agents and map sizes. We have developed the first centralized learning-based policy for MAPF problem called RAILGUN. RAILGUN is not an agent-based policy but a map-based policy. By leveraging a CNN-based architecture, RAILGUN can generalize across different maps and handle any number of agents. We collect trajectories from rule-based methods to train our model in a supervised way. In experiments, RAILGUN outperforms most baseline methods and demonstrates great zero-shot generalization capabilities on various tasks, maps and agent numbers that were not seen in the training dataset.

Abstract: We identify the slow liquidity drain (SLID) scam, an insidious and highly profitable threat to decentralized finance (DeFi), posing a large-scale, persistent, and growing risk to the ecosystem. Unlike traditional scams such as rug pulls or honeypots (USENIX Sec'19, USENIX Sec'23), SLID gradually siphons funds from liquidity pools over extended periods, making detection significantly more challenging. In this paper, we conducted the first large-scale empirical analysis of 319,166 liquidity pools across six major decentralized exchanges (DEXs) since 2018. We identified 3,117 SLID affected liquidity pools, resulting in cumulative losses of more than US$103 million. We propose a rule-based heuristic and an enhanced machine learning model for early detection. Our machine learning model achieves a detection speed 4.77 times faster than the heuristic while maintaining 95% accuracy. Our study establishes a foundation for protecting DeFi investors at an early stage and promoting transparency in the DeFi ecosystem.

Abstract: The convergence of Web3 technologies and AI agents represents a rapidly evolving frontier poised to reshape decentralized ecosystems. This paper presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics, governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3 governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing (RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust, intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent interactions.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) struggles with the slow adaptation of late-joining delayed clients and high communication costs in asynchronous environments. These limitations significantly hinder overall performance. To address this, we propose DFedCAD, a novel framework for rapid adaptation via Centroid-Aligned Distillation. DFedCAD first employs Weighted Cluster Pruning (WCP) to compress models into representative centroids, drastically reducing communication overhead. It then enables delayed clients to intelligently weigh and align with peer knowledge using a novel structural distance metric and a differentiable k-means distillation module, facilitating efficient end-to-end knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that DFedCAD consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining the highest accuracy across all evaluated settings while reducing communication overhead by over 86%. Our framework provides a scalable and practical solution for efficient decentralized learning in dynamic, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: As As autonomous AI agents scale across cloud, enterprise, and decentralized environments, the need for standardized registry systems to support discovery, identity, and capability sharing has become essential. This paper surveys three prominent registry approaches each defined by a unique metadata model: MCP's mcp.json, A2A's Agent Card, and NANDA's AgentFacts. MCP uses a centralized metaregistry with GitHub authenticated publishing and structured metadata for server discovery. A2A enables decentralized interaction via JSON-based Agent Cards, discoverable through well-known URIs, curated catalogs, or direct configuration. NANDA Index introduces AgentFacts, a cryptographically verifiable and privacy-preserving metadata model designed for dynamic discovery, credentialed capabilities, and cross-domain interoperability. These approaches are compared across four dimensions: security, scalability, authentication, and maintainability. The paper concludes with suggestions and recommendations to guide future design and adoption of registry systems for the Internet of AI Agents.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows, conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients. Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process: first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy, and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while assuming limited-resource clients.

Abstract: The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has created a growing demand for accurate yield and performance forecasting to guide liquidity allocation strategies. In this study, we benchmark six models, XGBoost, Random Forest, LSTM, Transformer, quantum neural networks (QNN), and quantum support vector machines with quantum feature maps (QSVM-QNN), on one year of historical data from 28 Curve Finance pools. We evaluate model performance on test MAE, RMSE, and directional accuracy. Our results show that classical ensemble models, particularly XGBoost and Random Forest, consistently outperform both deep learning and quantum models. XGBoost achieves the highest directional accuracy (71.57%) with a test MAE of 1.80, while Random Forest attains the lowest test MAE of 1.77 and 71.36% accuracy. In contrast, quantum models underperform with directional accuracy below 50% and higher errors, highlighting current limitations in applying quantum machine learning to real-world DeFi time series data. This work offers a reproducible benchmark and practical insights into model suitability for DeFi applications, emphasizing the robustness of classical methods over emerging quantum approaches in this domain.

Abstract: This paper proposes Oze, a concurrency control protocol that handles heterogeneous workloads, including long-running update transactions. Oze explores a large scheduling space using a multi-version serialization graph to reduce false positives. Oze manages the graph in a decentralized manner to exploit many cores in modern servers. We further propose an OLTP benchmark, BoMB (Bill of Materials Benchmark), based on a use case in an actual manufacturing company. BoMB consists of one long-running update transaction and five short transactions that conflict with each other. Experiments using BoMB show that Oze can handle the long-running update transaction while achieving four orders of magnitude higher throughput than state-of-the-art optimistic and multi-version protocols and up to five times higher throughput than pessimistic protocols. We also show Oze performs comparably with existing techniques even in a typical OLTP workload, TPC-C, thanks to a protocol switching mechanism.

Abstract: In cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL), centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) has recently attracted more attention due to the physical demand. However, the most dilemma therein is the inconsistency between jointly-trained policies and individually-executed actions. In this article, we propose a factorized Tchebycheff value-decomposition optimization (TVDO) method to overcome the trouble of inconsistency. In particular, a nonlinear Tchebycheff aggregation function is formulated to realize the global optimum by tightly constraining the upper bound of individual action-value bias, which is inspired by the Tchebycheff method of multi-objective optimization. We theoretically prove that, under no extra limitations, the factorized value decomposition with Tchebycheff aggregation satisfies the sufficiency and necessity of Individual-Global-Max (IGM), which guarantees the consistency between the global and individual optimal action-value function. Empirically, in the climb and penalty game, we verify that TVDO precisely expresses the global-to-individual value decomposition with a guarantee of policy consistency. Meanwhile, we evaluate TVDO in the SMAC benchmark, and extensive experiments demonstrate that TVDO achieves a significant performance superiority over some SOTA MARL baselines.

Abstract: Due to the high flexibility and versatility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are leveraged in various fields including surveillance and disaster rescue.However, in UAV networks, routing is vulnerable to malicious damage due to distributed topologies and high dynamics. Hence, ensuring the routing security of UAV networks is challenging. In this paper, we characterize the routing process in a time-varying UAV network with malicious nodes. Specifically, we formulate the routing problem to minimize the total delay, which is an integer linear programming and intractable to solve. Then, to tackle the network security issue, a blockchain-based trust management mechanism (BTMM) is designed to dynamically evaluate trust values and identify low-trust UAVs. To improve traditional practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithms in the blockchain, we propose a consensus UAV update mechanism. Besides, considering the local observability, the routing problem is reformulated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process. Further, a multi-agent double deep Q-network based routing algorithm is designed to minimize the total delay. Finally, simulations are conducted with attacked UAVs and numerical results show that the delay of the proposed mechanism decreases by 13.39$\%$, 12.74$\%$, and 16.6$\%$ than multi-agent proximal policy optimal algorithms, multi-agent deep Q-network algorithms, and methods without BTMM, respectively.

<title>Soft Separation and Distillation: Toward Global Uniformity in Federated Unsupervised Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Unsupervised Learning (FUL) aims to learn expressive representations in federated and self-supervised settings. The quality of representations learned in FUL is usually determined by uniformity, a measure of how uniformly representations are distributed in the embedding space. However, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local) uniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global) uniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the decentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation and Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity by encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions. This design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby improving global uniformity while preserving local representation expressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector distillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and representation quality. We evaluate SSD in both cross-silo and cross-device federated settings, demonstrating consistent improvements in representation quality and task performance across various training scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of inter-client uniformity in FUL and establish SSD as an effective solution to this challenge. Project page: https://ssd-uniformity.github.io/

Abstract: As an emerging service framework built by combining cryptography, P2P network, consensus mechanism and innovative contract technology, blockchain has been widely used in digital finance, data sharing, message traceability and electronic evidence preservation because of its decentralised, non-tamperable and transaction traceability. However, with the complex and changeable application scenarios of blockchain technology and the continuous enhancement of blockchain attack technology, the security of the blockchain system has been seriously threatened, dramatically affecting the development and application of blockchain technology. This paper aims to analyse the attacks on blockchain from the perspective of cryptography. Firstly, from the cryptography technology in the blockchain, the principle of hash functions, digital signatures, and other technologies, as well as their role in the blockchain, are introduced. Then, based on the six-layer architecture of the blockchain, the attacks on the data layer, the network layer, the consensus layer, the contract layer, the incentive layer and the application layer are analysed, and the methods to mitigate or resist the attacks are proposed. Secondly, the attack principles of 51% attack, Double-Spending attack, Reentrancy attack, Replay attack, Sybil attack and Timestamp Tampering attack were analysed, and the mitigation or defence solutions for these six attacks were designed. Finally, the core problems to be solved in blockchain technology are summarised, and the future development of blockchain security technology is projected.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs), is transforming enterprise ecosystems with autonomous agents that execute complex workflows. Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability, and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across agent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine (DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission revocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in neutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS attacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a practical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that BlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment in production LLM-based MAS environments.

<title>UEChecker: Detecting Unchecked External Call Vulnerabilities in DApps via Graph Analysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing number of attacks on the contract layer of DApps has resulted in economic losses amounting to $66 billion. Vulnerabilities arise when contracts interact with external protocols without verifying the results of the calls, leading to exploit entry points such as flash loan attacks and reentrancy attacks. In this paper, we propose UEChecker, a deep learning-based tool that utilizes a call graph and a Graph Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. We design the following components: An edge prediction module that reconstructs the feature representation of nodes and edges in the call graph; A node aggregation module that captures structural information from both the node itself and its neighbors, thereby enhancing feature representation between nodes and improving the model's understanding of the global graph structure; A Conformer Block module that integrates multi-head attention, convolutional modules, and feedforward neural networks to more effectively capture dependencies of different scales within the call graph, extending beyond immediate neighbors and enhancing the performance of vulnerability detection. Finally, we combine these modules with Graph Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. By auditing the smart contracts of 608 DApps, our results show that our tool achieves an accuracy of 87.59% in detecting unchecked external call vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we compare our tool with GAT, LSTM, and GCN baselines, and in the comparison experiments, UEChecker consistently outperforms these models in terms of accuracy.

Abstract: The introduction of smart contract functionality marks the advent of the blockchain 2.0 era, enabling blockchain technology to support digital currency transactions and complex distributed applications. However, many smart contracts have been found to contain vulnerabilities and errors, leading to the loss of assets within the blockchain. Despite a range of tools that have been developed to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts at the source code or bytecode level, most rely on a single modality, reducing performance, accuracy, and limited generalization capabilities. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning approach, MultiCFV, which is designed specifically to analyze and detect erroneous control flow vulnerability, as well as identify code clones in smart contracts. Bytecode is generated from source code to construct control flow graphs, with graph embedding techniques extracting graph features. Abstract syntax trees are used to obtain syntax features, while code comments capture key commentary words and comment features. These three feature vectors are fused to create a database for code inspection, which is used to detect similar code and identify contract vulnerabilities. Experimental results demonstrate our method effectively combines structural, syntactic, and semantic information, improving the accuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection and clone detection.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS). Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive a general convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present several sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence of the global model. These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation methods both satisfy our convergence condition, but differ in their ability to achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.

<title>NATLM: Detecting Defects in NFT Smart Contracts Leveraging LLM</title>

arXiv:2508.01351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security issues are becoming increasingly significant with the rapid evolution of Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). As NFTs are traded as digital assets, they have emerged as prime targets for cyber attackers. In the development of NFT smart contracts, there may exist undiscovered defects that could lead to substantial financial losses if exploited. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a framework called NATLM(NFT Assistant LLM), designed to detect potential defects in NFT smart contracts. The framework effectively identifies four common types of vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts: ERC-721 Reentrancy, Public Burn, Risky Mutable Proxy, and Unlimited Minting. Relying exclusively on large language models (LLMs) for defect detection can lead to a high false-positive rate. To enhance detection performance, NATLM integrates static analysis with LLMs, specifically Gemini Pro 1.5. Initially, NATLM employs static analysis to extract structural, syntactic, and execution flow information from the code, represented through Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and Control Flow Graphs (CFG). These extracted features are then combined with vectors of known defect examples to create a matrix for input into the knowledge base. Subsequently, the feature vectors and code vectors of the analyzed contract are compared with the contents of the knowledge base. Finally, the LLM performs deep semantic analysis to enhance detection capabilities, providing a more comprehensive and accurate identification of potential security issues. Experimental results indicate that NATLM analyzed 8,672 collected NFT smart contracts, achieving an overall precision of 87.72%, a recall of 89.58%, and an F1 score of 88.94%. The results outperform other baseline experiments, successfully identifying four common types of defects.

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of using LLMs for Automated Exploit Generation (AEG) against vulnerable smart contracts. We present \textsc{ReX}, a framework integrating LLM-based exploit synthesis with the Foundry testing suite, enabling the automated generation and validation of proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits. We evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Opus 4, DeepSeek, and Qwen3 Plus) on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world smart contracts affected by known high-impact exploits. Our results show that modern LLMs can reliably generate functional PoC exploits for diverse vulnerability types, with success rates reaching up to 92\%. Notably, Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4.1 consistently outperform others in both synthetic and real-world scenarios. We further analyze factors influencing AEG effectiveness, including model capabilities, contract structure, and vulnerability types. We also collect the first curated dataset of real-world PoC exploits to support future research.

arXiv:2508.01448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain record the amount of work W that went into creating them through proofs of work. When honest parties control a majority of the work, consensus is achieved by picking the chain with the highest recorded weight. Resources other than work have been considered to secure such longest-chain blockchains. In Chia, blocks record the amount of space S (via a proof of space) and sequential computational steps V (via a VDF).
  In this paper, we ask what weight functions {\Gamma}(S,V,W) (that assign a weight to a block as a function of the recorded space, speed, and work) are secure in the sense that whenever the weight of the resources controlled by honest parties is larger than the weight of adversarial parties, the blockchain is secure against private double-spending attacks.
  We completely classify such functions in an idealized "continuous" model: {\Gamma}(S,V,W) is secure against private double-spending attacks if and only if it is homogeneous of degree one in the timed resources V and W, i.e., {\alpha}{\Gamma}(S,V,W)={\Gamma}(S,{\alpha}V, {\alpha}W). This includes Bitcoin rule {\Gamma}(S,V,W)=W and Chia rule {\Gamma}(S,V,W) = SV. In a more realistic model where blocks are created at discrete time-points, one additionally needs some mild assumptions on the dependency on S (basically, the weight should not grow too much if S is slightly increased, say linear as in Chia).
  Our classification is more general and allows various instantiations of the same resource. It provides a powerful tool for designing new longest-chain blockchains. E.g., consider combining different PoWs to counter centralization, say the Bitcoin PoW W_1 and a memory-hard PoW W_2. Previous work suggested to use W_1+W_2 as weight. Our results show that using {\sqrt}(W_1){\cdot}{\sqrt}(W_2), {\min}{W_1,W_2} are also secure, and we argue that in practice these are much better choices.

Abstract: This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states, inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition, we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller, enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete in-flight loss of one MAV.

<title>Revisiting Gossip Protocols: A Vision for Emergent Coordination in Agentic Multi-Agent Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As agentic platforms scale, agents are evolving beyond static roles and fixed toolchains, creating a growing need for flexible, decentralized coordination. Today's structured communication protocols (e.g., direct agent-to-agent messaging) excel at reliability and task delegation, but they fall short in enabling emergent, swarm-like intelligence, where distributed agents continuously learn, adapt, and communicate to form collective cognition. This paper revisits gossip protocols, long valued in distributed systems for their fault tolerance and decentralization, and argues that they offer a missing layer for context-rich, adaptive communication in agentic AI. Gossip enables scalable, low-overhead dissemination of shared knowledge, but also raises unresolved challenges around semantic filtering, staleness, trustworthiness, and consistency in high-stakes environments. Rather than proposing a new framework, this work charts a research agenda for integrating gossip as a complementary substrate alongside structured protocols. We identify critical gaps in current agent-to-agent architectures, highlight where gossip could reshape assumptions about coordination, and outline open questions around intent propagation, knowledge decay, and peer-to-peer trust. Gossip is not a silver bullet, but overlooking it risks missing a key path toward resilient, reflexive, and self-organizing multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, traditional FL suffers from communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and straggler effects. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) addresses these by allowing clients to update independently, improving scalability and reducing synchronization delays. This paper extends AFL to handle non-convex objective functions and heterogeneous datasets, common in modern deep learning. We present a rigorous convergence analysis, deriving bounds on the expected gradient norm and studying the effects of staleness, variance, and heterogeneity. To mitigate stale updates, we introduce a staleness aware aggregation that prioritizes fresher updates and a dynamic learning rate schedule that adapts to client staleness and heterogeneity, improving stability and convergence. Our framework accommodates variations in computational power, data distribution, and communication delays, making it practical for real world applications. We also analyze the impact of client selection strategies-sampling with or without replacement-on variance and convergence. Implemented in PyTorch with Python's asyncio, our approach is validated through experiments demonstrating improved performance and scalability for asynchronous, heterogeneous, and non-convex FL scenarios.

Abstract: Anonymous communication networks have emerged as crucial tools for obfuscating communication pathways and concealing user identities. However, their practical deployments face significant challenges, including susceptibility to artificial intelligence (AI)-powered metadata analysis, difficulties in decentralized architectures, and the absence of provable security guarantees. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel decentralized anonymous routing protocol with resistance to tracing and traffic analysis. The protocol eliminates dependencies on the threshold model and trusted third-party setups, ensuring indistinguishable identity privacy even in highly adversarial environments. Different from traditional empirical security analysis of anonymous networks, this paper rigorously proves indistinguishable identity privacy for users even in extremely adversarial environments. Furthermore, simulations confirm its practical feasibility, demonstrating both security and efficiency. By achieving information sharing with privacy preservation, the proposed protocol offers a provably secure solution for privacy-preserving communication in digital environments.

Abstract: Blockchain technology has advanced rapidly in recent years and is now widely used in a variety of fields. Blockchain appears to be one of the best solutions for managing massive heterogeneous devices while achieving advanced data security and data reputation, particularly in the field of large-scale IoT (Internet of Things) networks. Despite the numerous advantages, there are still challenges while deploying IoT applications on blockchain systems due to the limited storage, power, and computing capability of IoT devices, and some of these problems are caused by the consensus algorithm, which plays a significant role in blockchain systems by ensuring overall system reliability and robustness. Nonetheless, most existing consensus algorithms are prone to poor node reliability, low transaction per second (TPS) rates, and scalability issues. Aiming at some critical problems in the existing consensus algorithms, this paper proposes the Efficient Byzantine Reputation-based Consensus (EBRC) mechanism to resolve the issues raised above. In comparison to traditional algorithms, we reinvented ways to evaluate node reliability and robustness and manage active nodes. Our experiments show that the EBRC algorithm has lower consensus delay, higher throughput, improved security, and lower verification costs. It offers new reference ideas for solving the Internet of Things+blockchain+Internet court construction problem.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in day-ahead energy markets introduces challenges in balancing supply and demand, ensuring grid resilience, and maintaining trust in decentralized trading systems. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method, with blockchain technology to optimize automated trading strategies for prosumers in day-ahead energy markets. We introduce a comprehensive framework that employs RL agent for multi-objective energy optimization and blockchain for tamper-proof data and transaction management. Simulations using real-world data from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The RL agent achieves demand-supply balancing within 2\% and maintains near-optimal supply costs for the majority of the operating hours. Moreover, it generates robust battery storage policies capable of handling variability in solar and wind generation. All decisions are recorded on an Algorand-based blockchain, ensuring transparency, auditability, and security - key enablers for trustworthy multi-agent energy trading. Our contributions include a novel system architecture, curriculum learning for robust agent development, and actionable policy insights for practical deployment.

<title>A Decentralized Framework for Ethical Authorship Validation in Academic Publishing: Leveraging Self-Sovereign Identity and Blockchain Technology</title>

Abstract: Academic publishing, integral to knowledge dissemination and scientific advancement, increasingly faces threats from unethical practices such as unconsented authorship, gift authorship, author ambiguity, and undisclosed conflicts of interest. While existing infrastructures like ORCID effectively disambiguate researcher identities, they fall short in enforcing explicit authorship consent, accurately verifying contributor roles, and robustly detecting conflicts of interest during peer review. To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces a decentralized framework leveraging Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and blockchain technology. The proposed model uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to securely verify author identities and contributions, reducing ambiguity and ensuring accurate attribution. A blockchain-based trust registry records authorship consent and peer-review activity immutably. Privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques, especially Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), support conflict-of-interest detection without revealing sensitive data. Verified authorship metadata and consent records are embedded in publications, increasing transparency. A stakeholder survey of researchers, editors, and reviewers suggests the framework improves ethical compliance and confidence in scholarly communication. This work represents a step toward a more transparent, accountable, and trustworthy academic publishing ecosystem.

Abstract: The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) pose significant threats to the integrity of personal identity, including digital cloning, sophisticated impersonation, and the unauthorized monetization of identity-related data. Mitigating these risks necessitates the development of robust AI-generated content detection systems, enhanced legal frameworks, and ethical guidelines. This paper introduces the Digital Identity Rights Framework (DIRF), a structured security and governance model designed to protect behavioral, biometric, and personality-based digital likeness attributes to address this critical need. Structured across nine domains and 63 controls, DIRF integrates legal, technical, and hybrid enforcement mechanisms to secure digital identity consent, traceability, and monetization. We present the architectural foundations, enforcement strategies, and key use cases supporting the need for a unified framework. This work aims to inform platform builders, legal entities, and regulators about the essential controls needed to enforce identity rights in AI-driven systems.

Abstract: Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) offers a secure and lightweight alternative to traditional cryptography for authentication due to their unique device fingerprint. However, their dependence on specialized hardware hinders their adoption in diverse applications. This paper proposes a novel blockchain framework that leverages SoftPUF, a software-based approach mimicking PUF. SoftPUF addresses the hardware limitations of traditional PUF, enabling secure and efficient authentication for a broader range of devices within a blockchain network. The framework utilizes a machine learning model trained on PUF data to generate unique, software-based keys for each device. These keys serve as secure identifiers for authentication on the blockchain, eliminating the need for dedicated hardware. This approach facilitates the integration of legacy devices from various domains, including cloud-based solutions, into the blockchain network. Additionally, the framework incorporates well-established defense mechanisms to ensure robust security against various attacks. This combined approach paves the way for secure and scalable authentication in diverse blockchain-based applications. Additionally, to ensure robust security, the system incorporates well-established defense mechanisms against various attacks, including 51%, phishing, routing, and Sybil attacks, into the blockchain network. This combined approach paves the way for secure and efficient authentication in a wider range of blockchain-based applications.

Abstract: The demand for data privacy has led to the development of frameworks like Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which facilitate decentralized model training. However, a significant operational challenge in such systems is adhering to the right to be forgotten. This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two distinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and their associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a user's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully address both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data removal or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work introduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution to these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy tailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning, it uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process, which is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any remaining data traces among affected clients. In the case of complete client unlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to purge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach. The framework achieves substantial improvements in model prediction accuracy across both client and meta-unlearning scenarios when compared to existing methods. Furthermore, additional studies confirm its utility as a plug-in module, where it materially enhances the predictive capabilities and unlearning effectiveness of other established methods.

Abstract: Open source software (OSS) generates trillions of dollars in economic value and has become essential to technical infrastructures worldwide. As organizations increasingly depend on OSS, understanding project evolution is critical. While existing metrics provide insights into project health, one dimension remains understudied: project resilience -- the ability to return to normal operations after disturbances such as contributor departures, security vulnerabilities, and bug report spikes. We hypothesize that stable commit patterns reflect underlying project characteristics such as mature governance, sustained contributors, and robust development processes that enable resilience. Building on the Composite Stability Index (CSI) framework, we empirically validate commit frequency patterns across 100 highly ranked repositories. Our findings reveal that only 2\% of repositories exhibit daily stability, 29\% achieve weekly stability, and 50\% demonstrate monthly stability, while half remain unstable across all temporal levels. Programming languages and blockchain applications were the most stable. We identified two exemplary repositories that achieved stability at all three granularities, whose governance models, CI cadence, and release policies could serve as reference frameworks. We observed that large yearly commit throughput does not necessarily correlate with stability. Beyond commits, stability can be enriched with issue-resolution times, PR merge rates, and community-engagement metrics to broaden resilience assessment and sharpen stability-based risk evaluation.

<title>Failure-Aware Multi-Robot Coordination for Resilient and Adaptive Target Tracking</title>

Abstract: Multi-robot coordination is crucial for autonomous systems, yet real-world deployments often encounter various failures. These include both temporary and permanent disruptions in sensing and communication, which can significantly degrade system robustness and performance if not explicitly modeled. Despite its practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in the literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the complexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware coordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot target tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our approach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1) probabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent sensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding inferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or communication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized behavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned into subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and collaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots experiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate independently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them to contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate our method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive assessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios. Results show that our framework consistently achieves robust performance in realistic environments with unknown danger zones, offering a practical and generalizable solution for the multi-robot systems community.

Abstract: Nicknames for Group Signatures (NGS) is a new signature scheme that extends Group Signatures (GS) with Signatures with Flexible Public Keys (SFPK). Via GS, each member of a group can sign messages on behalf of the group without revealing his identity, except to a designated auditor. Via SFPK, anyone can create new identities for a particular user, enabling anonymous transfers with only the intended recipient able to trace these new identities.
  To prevent the potential abuses that this anonymity brings, NGS integrates flexible public keys into the GS framework to support auditable transfers. In addition to introducing NGS, we describe its security model and provide a mathematical construction proved secure in the Random Oracle Model. As a practical NGS use case, we build NickHat, a blockchain-based token-exchange prototype system on top of Ethereum.

Abstract: Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that has applications in many domains such as cryptocurrency, smart contracts, supply chain management, and many others. Distributed consensus is a fundamental component of blockchain systems that enables secure, precise, and tamper-proof verification of data without relying on central authorities. Existing consensus protocols, nevertheless, suffer from drawbacks, some of which are related to scalability, resource consumption, and fault tolerance. We introduce Blockchain Epidemic Consensus Protocol (BECP), a novel fully decentralised consensus protocol for blockchain networks at a large scale. BECP follows epidemic communication principles, without fixed roles like validators or leaders, and achieves probabilistic convergence, efficient message dissemination, and tolerance to message delays. We provide an extensive experimental comparison of BECP against classic protocols like PAXOS, RAFT, and PBFT, and newer epidemic-based protocols like Avalanche and Snowman. The findings indicate that BECP provides desirable gains in throughput, consensus latency, and substantial message-passing efficiency compared to existing epidemic-based approaches, validating its usability as an effective and scalable approach for next-generation blockchain systems.

Abstract: Blockchain is a decentralised, immutable ledger technology that has been widely adopted in many sectors for various applications such as cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and supply chain management. Distributed consensus is a fundamental component of blockchain, which is required to ensure trust, security, and integrity of the data stored and the transactions processed in the blockchain. Various consensus algorithms have been developed, each affected from certain issues such as node failures, high resource consumption, collusion, etc. This work introduces a fully decentralised consensus protocol, Blockchain Epidemic Consensus Protocol (BECP), suitable for very large and extreme-scale blockchain systems. The proposed approach leverages the benefits of epidemic protocols, such as no reliance on a fixed set of validators or leaders, probabilistic guarantees of convergence, efficient use of network resources, and tolerance to node and network failures. A comparative experimental analysis has been carried out with traditional protocols including PAXOS, RAFT, and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), as well as a relatively more recent protocol such as Avalanche, which is specifically designed for very large-scale systems. The results illustrate how BECP outperforms them in terms of throughput, scalability and consensus latency. BECP achieves an average of 1.196 times higher throughput in terms of consensus on items and 4.775 times better average consensus latency. Furthermore, BECP significantly reduces the number of messages compared to Avalanche. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of fully decentralised consensus for blockchain technology based on epidemic protocols.

Abstract: Multi-agent shepherding represents a challenging distributed control problem where herder agents must coordinate to guide independently moving targets to desired spatial configurations. Most existing control strategies assume cohesive target behavior, which frequently fails in practical applications where targets exhibit stochastic autonomous behavior. This paper presents a hierarchical learning-based control architecture that decomposes the shepherding problem into a high-level decision-making module and a low-level motion control component. The proposed distributed control system synthesizes effective control policies directly from closed-loop experience without requiring explicit inter-agent communication or prior knowledge of target dynamics. The decentralized architecture achieves cooperative control behavior through emergent coordination without centralized supervision. Experimental validation demonstrates superior closed-loop performance compared to state-of-the-art heuristic control methods, achieving 100\% success rates with improved settling times and control efficiency. The control architecture scales beyond its design conditions, adapts to time-varying goal regions, and demonstrates practical implementation feasibility through real-time experiments on the Robotarium platform.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving framework for training audio classification (AC) models across decentralized clients without sharing raw data. However, Federated Audio Classification (FedAC) faces three major challenges: data heterogeneity, model heterogeneity, and data poisoning, which degrade performance in real-world settings. While existing methods often address these issues separately, a unified and robust solution remains underexplored. We propose FedMLAC, a mutual learning-based FL framework that tackles all three challenges simultaneously. Each client maintains a personalized local AC model and a lightweight, globally shared Plug-in model. These models interact via bidirectional knowledge distillation, enabling global knowledge sharing while adapting to local data distributions, thus addressing both data and model heterogeneity. To counter data poisoning, we introduce a Layer-wise Pruning Aggregation (LPA) strategy that filters anomalous Plug-in updates based on parameter deviations during aggregation. Extensive experiments on four diverse audio classification benchmarks, including both speech and non-speech tasks, show that FedMLAC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in classification accuracy and robustness to noisy data.

Abstract: As the airspace becomes increasingly congested, decentralized conflict resolution methods for airplane encounters have become essential. While decentralized safety controllers can prevent dangerous midair collisions, they do not always ensure prompt conflict resolution. As a result, airplane progress may be blocked for extended periods in certain situations. To address this blocking phenomenon, this paper proposes integrating bio-inspired nonlinear opinion dynamics into the airplane safety control framework, thereby guaranteeing both safety and blocking-free resolution. In particular, opinion dynamics enable the safety controller to achieve collaborative decision-making for blocking resolution and facilitate rapid, safe coordination without relying on communication or preset rules. Extensive simulation results validate the improved flight efficiency and safety guarantees. This study provides practical insights into the design of autonomous controllers for airplanes.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However, detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to better extract key facial features and improve detection performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and reliable drowsiness detection.

Abstract: The rising popularity of Internet of things (IoT) has spurred technological advancements in mobile internet and interconnected systems. While offering flexible connectivity and intelligent applications across various domains, IoT service providers must gather vast amounts of sensitive data from users, which nonetheless concomitantly raises concerns about privacy breaches. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized training paradigm to tackle this challenge. This work focuses on enhancing the aggregation efficiency of distributed local models by introducing over-the-air computation into the FL framework. Due to radio resource scarcity in large-scale networks, only a subset of users can participate in each training round. This highlights the need for effective user scheduling and model transmission strategies to optimize communication efficiency and inference accuracy. To address this, we propose an integrated approach to user scheduling and receive beam steering, subject to constraints on the number of selected users and transmit power. Leveraging the difference-of-convex technique, we decompose the primal non-convex optimization problem into two sub-problems, yielding an iterative solution. While effective, the computational load of the iterative method hampers its practical implementation. To overcome this, we further propose a low-complexity user scheduling policy based on characteristic analysis of the wireless channel to directly determine the user subset without iteration. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of aggregation error and learning performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Collective decision-making is a key function of autonomous robot swarms, enabling them to reach a consensus on actions based on environmental features. Existing strategies require the participation of all robots in the decision-making process, which is resource-intensive and prevents the swarm from allocating the robots to any other tasks. We propose Subset-Based Collective Decision-Making (SubCDM), which enables decisions using only a swarm subset. The construction of the subset is dynamic and decentralized, relying solely on local information. Our method allows the swarm to adaptively determine the size of the subset for accurate decision-making, depending on the difficulty of reaching a consensus. Simulation results using one hundred robots show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to using the entire swarm while reducing the number of robots required to perform collective decision-making, making it a resource-efficient solution for collective decision-making in swarm robotics.

Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively learn a shared machine learning (ML) model by leveraging their privately held datasets distributed across the network, through interactive exchange of the intermediate model updates. To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques are commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite growing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on protocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the fundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal bounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings, where no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the problem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users, each holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who aim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires that no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up to $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In particular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at least one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no fewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols. Our results establish the fundamental performance limits of DSA, providing insights for the design of provably secure and communication-efficient protocols in distributed learning systems.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are increasingly used in critical applications such as aerial mapping, environmental monitoring, and autonomous delivery. However, the reliability of these systems is highly dependent on uninterrupted access to the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals, which can be disrupted in real-world scenarios due to interference, environmental conditions, or adversarial attacks, causing disorientation, collision risks, and mission failure. This paper proposes SwarnRaft, a blockchain-inspired positioning and consensus framework for maintaining coordination and data integrity in UAV swarms operating under GNSS-denied conditions. SwarnRaft leverages the Raft consensus algorithm to enable distributed drones (nodes) to agree on state updates such as location and heading, even in the absence of GNSS signals for one or more nodes. In our prototype, each node uses GNSS and local sensing, and communicates over WiFi in a simulated swarm. Upon signal loss, consensus is used to reconstruct or verify the position of the failed node based on its last known state and trajectory. Our system demonstrates robustness in maintaining swarm coherence and fault tolerance through a lightweight, scalable communication model. This work offers a practical and secure foundation for decentralized drone operation in unpredictable environments.

Abstract: Deploying deep models in real-world scenarios remains challenging due to significant performance drops under distribution shifts between training and deployment environments. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a promising solution, enabling on-the-fly model adaptation without access to source data. However, its effectiveness degrades significantly in the presence of complex, mixed distribution shifts - common in practical settings - where multiple latent domains coexist. Adapting under such intrinsic heterogeneity, especially in unlabeled and online conditions, remains an open and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we study TTA under mixed distribution shifts and move beyond conventional homogeneous adaptation paradigms. By revisiting TTA from a frequency-domain perspective, we observe that distribution heterogeneity often manifests in Fourier space - for instance, high-frequency components tend to carry domain-specific variations. This motivates us to perform domain-aware separation using high-frequency texture cues, making diverse shift patterns more tractable. To this end, we propose FreDA, a novel Frequency-based Decentralized Adaptation framework that decomposes globally heterogeneous data into locally homogeneous components in the frequency domain. It further employs decentralized learning and augmentation strategies to robustly adapt under complex, evolving shifts. Extensive experiments across various environments (corrupted, natural, and medical) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over the state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have changed the reality of how software is produced. Within the wider software engineering community, among many other purposes, they are explored for code generation use cases from different types of input. In this work, we present an exploratory study to investigate the use of LLMs for generating smart contract code from business process descriptions, an idea that has emerged in recent literature to overcome the limitations of traditional rule-based code generation approaches. However, current LLM-based work evaluates generated code on small samples, relying on manual inspection, or testing whether code compiles but ignoring correct execution. With this work, we introduce an automated evaluation framework and provide empirical data from larger data sets of process models. We test LLMs of different types and sizes in their capabilities of achieving important properties of process execution, including enforcing process flow, resource allocation, and data-based conditions. Our results show that LLM performance falls short of the perfect reliability required for smart contract development. We suggest future work to explore responsible LLM integrations in existing tools for code generation to ensure more reliable output. Our benchmarking framework can serve as a foundation for developing and evaluating such integrations.

<title>Simulation-based planning of Motion Sequences for Automated Procedure Optimization in Multi-Robot Assembly Cells</title>

Abstract: Reconfigurable multi-robot cells offer a promising approach to meet fluctuating assembly demands. However, the recurrent planning of their configurations introduces new challenges, particularly in generating optimized, coordinated multi-robot motion sequences that minimize the assembly duration. This work presents a simulation-based method for generating such optimized sequences. The approach separates assembly steps into task-related core operations and connecting traverse operations. While core operations are constrained and predetermined, traverse operations offer substantial optimization potential. Scheduling the core operations is formulated as an optimization problem, requiring feasible traverse operations to be integrated using a decomposition-based motion planning strategy. Several solution techniques are explored, including a sampling heuristic, tree-based search and gradient-free optimization. For motion planning, a decomposition method is proposed that identifies specific areas in the schedule, which can be solved independently with modified centralized path planning algorithms. The proposed method generates efficient and collision-free multi-robot assembly procedures that outperform a baseline relying on decentralized, robot-individual motion planning. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation experiments.

Abstract: This study investigates the presence of left-wing extremism on the Lemmygrad.ml instance of the decentralized social media platform Lemmy, from its launch in 2019 up to a month after the bans of the subreddits r/GenZedong and r/GenZhou. We conduct a temporal analysis on Lemmygrad.ml's user activity, with also measuring the degree of highly abusive or hateful content. Furthermore, we explore the content of their posts using a transformer-based topic modeling approach. Our findings reveal a substantial increase in user activity and toxicity levels following the migration of these subreddits to Lemmygrad.ml. We also identify posts that support authoritarian regimes, endorse the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and feature anti-Zionist and antisemitic content. Overall, our findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of political extremism within decentralized social networks and emphasize the necessity of analyzing both ends of the political spectrum in research.

Abstract: While many robotic tasks can be addressed using either centralized single-agent control with full state observation or decentralized multi-agent control, clear criteria for choosing between these approaches remain underexplored. This paper systematically investigates how multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with local observations can improve robustness in complex robotic systems compared to traditional centralized control. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that in certain tasks, decentralized MARL can achieve performance comparable to centralized methods while exhibiting greater resilience to perturbations and agent failures. By analytically demonstrating the equivalence of single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL) and MARL under full observability, we identify observability as the critical factor distinguishing the two paradigms. We further derive bounds quantifying performance degradation under external perturbations for locally observable policies. Empirical results on standard MARL benchmarks confirm that MARL with limited observations can maintain competitive performance. Finally, real-world experiments with a mobile manipulator demonstrate that decentralized MARL controllers achieve markedly improved robustness to agent malfunctions and environmental disturbances relative to centralized baselines. Together, these findings highlight MARL with local observations as a robust and practical alternative to conventional centralized control in complex robotic systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) model that uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for identity management and privacy-preserving interactions within a Punishment not Reward (PnR) blockchain mechanism. The proposed model introduces a dual NFT architecture deployed on Layer 2 networks: Membership NFTs (\(NFT_{auth}\)) for authentication and access control and interaction NFTs (\(NFT_{priv}\)) for private interactions among participants. Our Layer 2 implementation achieves 97\% gas cost reduction while maintaining security through cross-chain mechanisms. The identity management system incorporates decentralised KYC processes and Sybil attack resistance using soulbound token characteristics. Governance operates through smart contracts that manage reputation and administer punitive measures, including conditional identity disclosure for forensic purposes. Governance operates through smart contracts that manage reputation and administer punitive measures, including conditional identity disclosure when misconduct is detected.

Abstract: For centuries, financial institutions have responded to liquidity challenges by forming closed, centralized clearing clubs with strict rules and membership that allow them to collaborate on using the least money to discharge the most debt. As closed clubs, much of the general public has been excluded from participation. But the vast majority of private sector actors consists of micro or small firms that are vulnerable to late payments and generally ineligible for bank loans. This low liquidity environment often results in gridlock and leads to insolvency, and it disproportionately impacts small enterprises and communities.
  On the other hand, blockchain communities have developed open, decentralized settlement systems, along with a proliferation of store of value assets and new lending protocols, allowing anyone to permissionlessly transact and access credit. However, these protocols remain used primarily for speculative purposes, and so far have fallen short of the large-scale positive impact on the real economy prophesied by their promoters.
  We address these challenges by introducing Cycles, an open, decentralized clearing, settlement, and issuance protocol. Cycles is designed to enable firms to overcome payment inefficiencies, to reduce their working capital costs, and to leverage diverse assets and liquidity sources, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and lending protocols, in service of clearing more debt with less money. Cycles solves real world liquidity challenges through a privacy-preserving multilateral settlement platform based on a graph optimization algorithm. The design is based on a core insight: liquidity resides within cycles in the payment network's structure and can be accessed via settlement flows optimized to reduce debt.

Abstract: Metaverse service is a product of the convergence between Metaverse and service systems, designed to address service-related challenges concerning digital avatars, digital twins, and digital natives within Metaverse. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), agents now play a pivotal role in Metaverse service ecosystem, serving dual functions: as digital avatars representing users in the virtual realm and as service assistants (or NPCs) providing personalized support. However, during the modeling of Metaverse service ecosystems, existing LLM-based agents face significant challenges in bridging virtual-world services with real-world services, particularly regarding issues such as character data fusion, character knowledge association, and ethical safety concerns. This paper proposes an explainable emotion alignment framework for LLM-based agents in Metaverse Service Ecosystem. It aims to integrate factual factors into the decision-making loop of LLM-based agents, systematically demonstrating how to achieve more relational fact alignment for these agents. Finally, a simulation experiment in the Offline-to-Offline food delivery scenario is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this framework, obtaining more realistic social emergence.

<title>SAEL: Leveraging Large Language Models with Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22371</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.22371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing security issues in blockchain, smart contract vulnerability detection has become a research focus. Existing vulnerability detection methods have their limitations: 1) Static analysis methods struggle with complex scenarios. 2) Methods based on specialized pre-trained models perform well on specific datasets but have limited generalization capabilities. In contrast, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability in adapting to new vulnerability patterns. However, they often underperform on specific vulnerability types compared to methods based on specialized pre-trained models. We also observe that explanations generated by general-purpose LLMs can provide fine-grained code understanding information, contributing to improved detection performance.
  Inspired by these observations, we propose SAEL, an LLM-based framework for smart contract vulnerability detection. We first design targeted prompts to guide LLMs in identifying vulnerabilities and generating explanations, which serve as prediction features. Next, we apply prompt-tuning on CodeT5 and T5 to process contract code and explanations, enhancing task-specific performance. To combine the strengths of each approach, we introduce an Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts architecture. This dynamically adjusts feature weights via a Gating Network, which selects relevant features using TopK filtering and Softmax normalization, and incorporates a Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism to enhance cross-feature relationships. This design enables effective integration of LLM predictions, explanation features, and code features through gradient optimization. The loss function jointly considers both independent feature performance and overall weighted predictions. Experiments show that SAEL outperforms existing methods across various vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Blockchain technology is widely used in various fields due to its ability to provide decentralization and trustless security. This is a fundamental understanding held by many advocates, but it is misunderstood, leading participants to fail to recognize the limitations of the security that blockchain can provide. Among all current network attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks pose significant threats due to their ease of execution and destructive potential. This paper, based on the blockchain architecture hierarchy, categorizes and organizes existing DoS attacks, with a focus on explaining the principles and methods of contract layer and consensus layer DoS attacks. Furthermore, this paper comprehensively analyzes and compares commonly used detection methods and defense technologies, which will contribute to strengthening the security and stability of blockchain systems and promoting further innovation and application of blockchain systems.

<title>Decentralized Differentially Private Power Method</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.22849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel Decentralized Differentially Private Power Method (D-DP-PM) for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in networked multi-agent settings. Unlike conventional decentralized PCA approaches where each agent accesses the full n-dimensional sample space, we address the challenging scenario where each agent observes only a subset of dimensions through row-wise data partitioning. Our method ensures $(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy (DP) while enabling collaborative estimation of global eigenvectors across the network without requiring a central aggregator. We achieve this by having agents share only local embeddings of the current eigenvector iterate, leveraging both the inherent privacy from random initialization and carefully calibrated Gaussian noise additions. We prove that our algorithm satisfies the prescribed $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee and establish convergence rates that explicitly characterize the impact of the network topology. Our theoretical analysis, based on linear dynamics and high-dimensional probability theory, provides tight bounds on both privacy and utility. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that D-DP-PM achieves superior privacy-utility tradeoffs compared to naive local DP approaches, with particularly strong performance in moderate privacy regimes ($\epsilon\in[2, 5]$). The method converges rapidly, allowing practitioners to trade iterations for enhanced privacy while maintaining competitive utility.

Abstract: A promising way to overcome the scalability limitations of the current blockchain is to use sharding, which is to split the transaction processing among multiple, smaller groups of nodes. A well-performed blockchain sharding system requires both high performance and high security in both intra- and cross-shard perspectives. However, existing protocols either have issues on protecting security or trade off great performance for security. In this paper, we propose SP-Chain, a blockchain sharding system with enhanced Security and Performance for both intra- and cross-shard perspectives. For intra-shard aspect, we design a two-phase concurrent voting scheme to provide high system throughput and low transaction confirmation latency. Moreover, we propose an efficient unbiased leader rotation scheme to ensure high performance under malicious behavior. For cross-shard aspect, a proof-assisted efficient cross-shard transaction processing mechanism is proposed to guard the cross-shard transactions with low overhead. We implement SP-Chain based on Harmony, and evaluate its performance via large-scale deployment. Extensive evaluations suggest that SP-Chain can process more than 10,000 tx/sec under malicious behaviors with a confirmation latency of 7.6s in a network of 4,000 nodes.

arXiv:2507.21087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing remains a critical threat to IoT networks, enabling attackers to intercept, modify, or disrupt data transmission by exploiting ARP's lack of authentication. The decentralized and resource-constrained nature of IoT environments amplifies this vulnerability, making conventional detection mechanisms ineffective at scale. This paper introduces an intelligent, multi-layered machine learning framework designed to detect ARP spoofing in real-time IoT deployments. Our approach combines feature engineering based on ARP header behavior, traffic flow analysis, and temporal packet anomalies with a hybrid detection pipeline incorporating decision trees, ensemble models, and deep learning classifiers. We propose a hierarchical architecture to prioritize lightweight models at edge gateways and deeper models at centralized nodes to balance detection accuracy and computational efficiency. The system is validated on both simulated IoT traffic and the CICIDS2017 dataset, achieving over 97% detection accuracy with low false positive rates. Comparative evaluations with signature-based and rule-based systems demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of our approach. Our results show that intelligent machine learning integration enables proactive ARP spoofing detection tailored for IoT scenarios, laying the groundwork for scalable and autonomous network security solutions.

<title>A Formal Rebuttal of "The Blockchain Trilemma: A Formal Proof of the Inherent Trade-Offs Among Decentralization, Security, and Scalability"</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.21111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive refutation of the so-called "blockchain trilemma," a widely cited but formally ungrounded claim asserting an inherent trade-off between decentralisation, security, and scalability in blockchain protocols. Through formal analysis, empirical evidence, and detailed critique of both methodology and terminology, we demonstrate that the trilemma rests on semantic equivocation, misuse of distributed systems theory, and a failure to define operational metrics. Particular focus is placed on the conflation of topological network analogies with protocol-level architecture, the mischaracterisation of Bitcoin's design--including the role of miners, SPV clients, and header-based verification--and the failure to ground claims in complexity-theoretic or adversarial models. By reconstructing Bitcoin as a deterministic, stateless distribution protocol governed by evidentiary trust, we show that scalability is not a trade-off but an engineering outcome. The paper concludes by identifying systemic issues in academic discourse and peer review that have allowed such fallacies to persist, and offers formal criteria for evaluating future claims in blockchain research.

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized approach that enables collaborative model training across multiple devices while preserving data privacy. It has shown significant potential in various domains, including healthcare and personalized recommendation systems. However, most existing work on federated recommendation systems has focused primarily on improving accuracy, with limited attention to fairness and diversity. In this paper, we introduce FedFlex, a federated recommender system for Netflix-style TV series recommendations. FedFlex integrates two state-of-the-art matrix factorization algorithms for personalized fine-tuning. FedFlex also applies Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) to re-rank items and enhance diversity. We conduct extensive experiments comparing recommendations generated by SVD and BPR algorithms. In a live two-week user study, participants received two recommendation lists: List A, based on SVD or BPR, and List B, a re-ranked version emphasizing diversity. Participants were asked to click on the movies they were interested in watching. Our findings demonstrate that FedFlex effectively introduces diverse content, such as new genres, into recommendations without necessarily compromising user satisfaction.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.21122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kintsugi is a protocol for key recovery, allowing a user to regain access to end-to-end encrypted data after they have lost their device, but still have their (potentially low-entropy) password. Existing E2EE key recovery methods, such as those deployed by Signal and WhatsApp, centralize trust by relying on servers administered by a single provider. Kintsugi is decentralized, distributing trust over multiple recovery nodes, which could be servers run by independent parties, or end user devices in a peer-to-peer setting. To recover a user's keys, a threshold $t+1$ of recovery nodes must assist the user in decrypting a shared backup. Kintsugi is password-authenticated and protects against offline brute-force password guessing without requiring any specialized secure hardware. Kintsugi can tolerate up to $t$ honest-but-curious colluding recovery nodes, as well as $n - t - 1$ offline nodes, and operates safely in an asynchronous network model where messages can be arbitrarily delayed.

arXiv:2507.21181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms offer numerous benefits and allow people to come together for various causes. Many communities, academia, government agencies, institutions, healthcare, entertainment, and businesses are on social media platforms. They are intuitive and free for users. It has become unimaginable to live without social media. Their architecture and data handling are geared towards scalability, uninterrupted availability, and both personal and collaborative revenue generation. Primarily, artificial intelligence algorithms are employed on stored user data for optimization and feeds. This has the potential to impact user safety, privacy, and security, even when metadata is used. A new decentralized data arrangement framework based on the Fractal-tree and L-Systems algorithm is proposed to mitigate some of the impacts of social media platforms.
  Future work will focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of the new decentralized framework by comparing its results against state-of-the-art security methods currently used in databases. A cryptographic algorithm could also be implemented for the framework, employing a new key generation for each branch. This will strengthen database security; for example, if a user key is leaked, regenerating the key for each branch will keep the data secure by applying defense mechanisms in the proposed L-System-based tree framework.

<title>Latte: Collaborative Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models in Federated Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.21494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has gained increasing attention for addressing distribution shifts during testing. Among these approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free nature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing test-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with abundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying these methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while directly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper personalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we propose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to store embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to store class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each client retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's coordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both embedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our theoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution clients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive experiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte achieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only negligible communication and computation costs. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Latte .

Abstract: Multi-robot SLAM aims at localizing and building a map with multiple robots, interacting with each other. In the work described in this article, we analyze the pipeline of a decentralized LiDAR SLAM system to study the current limitations of the state of the art, and we discover a significant source of failures, i.e., that the loop detection is the source of too many false positives. We therefore develop and propose a new heuristic to overcome these limitations. The environment taken as reference in this work is the highly challenging case of underground tunnels. We also highlight potential new research areas still under-explored.

Abstract: Commitments play a crucial role in game theory, shaping strategic interactions by either altering a player's own payoffs or influencing the incentives of others through outcome-contingent payments. While most research has focused on using commitments to achieve efficient equilibria, their potential applications beyond this goal remain largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce a non-coercive extortion mechanism that leverages commitments to outcome-contingent payments, demonstrating how a player or external agent can extract profit by offering rewards rather than threatening punishment. At the core of the mechanism is the introduction of sequentiality into a simultaneous-move game, fundamentally reshaping the strategic interaction. We derive the conditions under which extortion is successful, identify the class of games susceptible to this scheme, and determine both the maximum extractable profit and the minimum required payment. To illustrate the extortion mechanism, we apply it to 2x2 games, highlighting how even simple strategic settings can be vulnerable to this form of manipulation. Our results reveal strategic vulnerabilities in competitive settings, with significant implications for economic markets, diplomatic relations, and multi-agent systems operating in blockchain environments. This work broadens our understanding of commitments in game theory and raises critical questions about how to safeguard strategic interactions from exploitation through non-coercive extortion.

Abstract: As news reporting becomes increasingly global and decentralized online, tracking related events across multiple sources presents significant challenges. Existing news summarization methods typically utilizes Large Language Models and Graphical methods on article-based summaries. However, this is not effective since it only considers the textual content of similarly dated articles to understand the gist of the event. To counteract the lack of analysis on the parties involved, it is essential to come up with a novel framework to gauge the importance of stakeholders and the connection of related events through the relevant entities involved. Therefore, we present SUnSET: Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for the task of Timeline Summarization (TLS). We leverage powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) to build SET triplets and introduced the use of stakeholder-based ranking to construct a $Relevancy$ metric, which can be extended into general situations. Our experimental results outperform all prior baselines and emerged as the new State-of-the-Art, highlighting the impact of stakeholder information within news article.

Abstract: Modeling and evaluation of automated vehicles (AVs) in mixed-autonomy traffic is essential prior to their safe and efficient deployment. This is especially important at urban junctions where complex multi-agent interactions occur. Current approaches for modeling vehicular maneuvers and interactions at urban junctions have limitations in formulating non-cooperative interactions and vehicle dynamics within a unified mathematical framework. Previous studies either assume predefined paths or rely on cooperation and central controllability, limiting their realism and applicability in mixed-autonomy traffic. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a modeling framework for trajectory planning and decentralized vehicular control at urban junctions. The framework employs a bi-level structure where the upper level generates kinematically feasible reference trajectories using an efficient graph search algorithm with a custom heuristic function, while the lower level employs a predictive controller for trajectory tracking and optimization. Unlike existing approaches, our framework does not require central controllability or knowledge sharing among vehicles. The vehicle kinematics are explicitly incorporated at both levels, and acceleration and steering angle are used as control variables. This intuitive formulation facilitates analysis of traffic efficiency, environmental impacts, and motion comfort. The framework's decentralized structure accommodates operational and stochastic elements, such as vehicles' detection range, perception uncertainties, and reaction delay, making the model suitable for safety analysis. Numerical and simulation experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate the framework's capability in modeling accurate and realistic vehicular maneuvers and interactions at various urban junctions, including unsignalized intersections and roundabouts.

<title>Effects of Vote Delegation in Blockchains: Who Wins?</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates which alternative benefits from vote delegation in binary collective decisions within blockchains. We begin by examining two extreme cases of voting weight distributions: Equal-Weight (EW), where each voter has equal voting weight, and Dominant-Weight (DW), where a single voter holds a majority of the voting weights before any delegation occurs. We show that vote delegation tends to benefit the ex-ante minority under EW, i.e., the alternative with a lower initial probability of winning. The converse holds under DW distribution. Through numerical simulations, we extend our findings to arbitrary voting weight distributions, showing that vote delegation benefits the ex-ante majority when it leads to a more balanced distribution of voting weights. Finally, in large communities where all agents have equal voting weight, vote delegation has a negligible impact on the outcome. As a practical consequence, vote delegation can be beneficial for blockchains with highly unbalanced voting rights, but not for those with balanced rights. In decentralized finance (DeFi), vote delegation is widely adopted to streamline governance and increase participation. However, it remains unclear when delegation actually aligns outcomes with community preferences.

Abstract: This research article presents a novel architecture to empower multi-agent economies by addressing two critical limitations of the emerging Agent2Agent (A2A) communication protocol: decentralized agent discoverability and agent-to-agent micropayments. By integrating distributed ledger technology (DLT), this architecture enables tamper-proof, on-chain publishing of AgentCards as smart contracts, providing secure and verifiable agent identities. The architecture further extends A2A with the x402 open standard, facilitating blockchain-agnostic, HTTP-based micropayments via the HTTP 402 status code. This enables autonomous agents to seamlessly discover, authenticate, and compensate each other across organizational boundaries. This work further presents a comprehensive technical implementation and evaluation, demonstrating the feasibility of DLT-based agent discovery and micropayments. The proposed approach lays the groundwork for secure, scalable, and economically viable multi-agent ecosystems, advancing the field of agentic AI toward trusted, autonomous economic interactions.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning method that enables decentralized model training while preserving data privacy. Despite its promise in medical imaging, recent FL methods are often sensitive to local factors such as optimizers and learning rates, limiting their robustness in practical deployments. In this work, we revisit vanilla FL to clarify the impact of edge device configurations, benchmarking recent FL methods on colorectal pathology and blood cell classification task. We numerically show that the choice of local optimizer and learning rate has a greater effect on performance than the specific FL method. Moreover, we find that increasing local training epochs can either enhance or impair convergence, depending on the FL method. These findings indicate that appropriate edge-specific configuration is more crucial than algorithmic complexity for achieving effective FL.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many real-world applications, including social networks, financial systems, and molecular biology. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto standard for learning from such data due to their strong representation capabilities. As GNNs are increasingly deployed in federated learning (FL) settings to preserve data locality and privacy, new privacy threats arise from the interaction between graph structures and decentralized training. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of cross-client membership inference attacks (CC-MIA) against node classification tasks of federated GNNs (FedGNNs), where a malicious client aims to infer which client owns the given data. Unlike prior centralized-focused work that focuses on whether a sample was included in training, our attack targets sample-to-client attribution, a finer-grained privacy risk unique to federated settings. We design a general attack framework that exploits FedGNNs' aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding proximity to link samples to their source clients across training rounds. We evaluate our attack across multiple graph datasets under realistic FL setups. Results show that our method achieves high performance on both membership inference and ownership identification. Our findings highlight a new privacy threat in federated graph learning-client identity leakage through structural and model-level cues, motivating the need for attribution-robust GNN design.

<title>"Blockchain-Enabled Zero Trust Framework for Securing FinTech Ecosystems Against Insider Threats and Cyber Attacks"</title>

Abstract: Fintech provides technological services to increase operational efficiency in financial institutions, but traditional perimeter-based defense mechanisms are insufficient against evolving cyber threats like insider attacks, malware intrusions, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). These vulnerabilities expose Fintech organizations to significant risks, including financial losses and data breaches. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a blockchain-integrated Zero Trust framework, adhering to the principle of "Never Trust, Always Verify." The framework uses Ethereum smart contracts to enforce Multi Factor Authentication (MFA), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and Just-In-Time (JIT) access privileges, effectively mitigating credential theft and insider threats, the effect of malware and APT attacks.
  The proposed solution transforms blockchain into a Policy Engine (PE) and Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), and policy storage, ensuring immutable access control and micro-segmentation. A decentralized application (DApp) prototype was developed and tested using STRIDE threat modeling, demonstrating resilience against spoofing, tampering, and privilege escalation. Comparative analysis with Perimeter-based systems revealed a trade-off: while the framework introduced a marginal latency increase (74.0 ms vs. 49.33 ms) and reduced throughput (30.77 vs. 50.0 requests/sec), it significantly enhanced security by eliminating single points of failure and enabling tamper-proof audit trails.
  Experimental validation on a 200-node simulated network confirmed the framework's robustness, with future optimizations targeting Layer-2 solutions for scalability. This work bridges the gap between Zero Trust theory and practical blockchain implementation, offering Fintech organizations a decentralized, cost-effective security model.

Abstract: Efficient container image distribution is crucial for enabling machine learning inference at the network edge, where resource limitations and dynamic network conditions create significant challenges. In this paper, we present PeerSync, a decentralized P2P-based system designed to optimize image distribution in edge environments. PeerSync employs a popularity- and network-aware download engine that dynamically adapts to content popularity and real-time network conditions using a sliding window mechanism. PeerSync further integrates automated tracker election for rapid peer discovery and dynamic cache management for efficient storage utilization. We implement PeerSync with 8000+ lines of Rust code and test its performance extensively on both physical edge devices and Docker-based emulations. Experimental results show that PeerSync delivers a remarkable speed increase of 2.72$\times$, 1.79$\times$, and 1.28$\times$ compared to the Baseline, Dragonfly, and Kraken, respectively, while significantly reducing peak cross-network traffic by 90.72\% under congested and varying network conditions.

Abstract: The Ethereum ecosystem, despite its maturity, continues to witness catastrophic attacks, with billions of dollars in assets lost annually. In response, a significant body of research has focused on identifying and mitigating smart contract vulnerabilities. However, these efforts predominantly focus on implementation-level bugs, leaving a critical gap between academic understanding of vulnerabilities and the root causes of real-world high-impact financial losses. We employ a two-pronged methodology: first, a systematic literature review of 71 academic papers to build a comprehensive and up-to-date catalog of 24 active and 5 deprecated vulnerabilities as understood by the research community. Second, we conduct an in-depth, empirical analysis of 50 of the most severe real-world exploits between 2022 and 2025, collectively incurring over \$1.09B in losses, to identify their true root causes. We introduce the concept of "exploit chains" by revealing that many incidents are not caused by isolated vulnerabilities but by combinations of human, operational, and economic design flaws that link with implementation bugs to enable an attack. Our analysis yields insights on how DApps are exploited in practice, leading to a novel, four-tier root-cause framework that moves beyond code-level vulnerabilities. We find that real-world successful attacks on Ethereum (and related networks) trace back to one of the four tiers of (1) protocol logic design, (2) lifecycle and governance, (3) external dependencies, and (4) traditional implementation bugs (classic smart contract vulnerabilities). We investigate the suitability of this multi-tier incident root-cause framework via a case study.

Abstract: Ethereum, a leading blockchain platform, has revolutionized the digital economy by enabling decentralized transactions and the execution of smart contracts. Ethereum transactions form the backbone of its network, facilitating peer-to-peer exchanges and interactions with complex decentralized applications. Smart contracts extend Ethereum's capabilities by automating processes and enabling trustless execution of agreements. Hence, understanding how these smart contracts interact is important in order to facilitate various performance optimizations, such as warming objects before they are being accessed and enabling concurrent execution. Of particular interest to us are the development of the calling graph, as well as the read sets and write sets of invocations within the same block, and the properties of the associated conflict graph that is derived from them. The latter is important for understanding the parallelization potential of smart contracts on Ethereum. We traced upwards of 2 million recent Ethereum blocks using call tracer and prestate tracer, out of a total of 21.4 million blocks at the time of writing. We report on the transactions per block distribution, the structure of call trees in smart contract invocations, the ratio of value-transfer transactions to smart contract invocations, as well as provide a comprehensive study of the structure of blocks' conflict graphs. We find that conflict graphs predominantly show a star like configuration, as well as other noteworthy structural properties.

Abstract: Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) rely on governance mechanism without centralized leadership. This paper presents an empirical study of user behavior in governance for a variety of DAOs, ranging from DeFi to gaming, using the Internet Computer Protocol DAO framework called SNS (Service Nervous System). To analyse user engagement, we measure participation rates and frequency of proposals submission and voter approval rates. We evaluate decision duration times to determine DAO agility. To investigate dynamic aspects, we also measure metric shifts in time. We evaluate over 3,000 proposals submitted in a time frame of 20 months from 14 SNS DAOs. The selected DAO have been existing between 6 and 20 months and cover a wide spectrum of use cases, treasury sizes, and number of participants. We also compare our results for SNS DAOs with DAOs from other blockchain platforms. While approval rates are generally high for all DAOs studied, SNS DAOs show slightly more alignment. We observe that the SNS governance mechanisms and processes in ICP lead to higher activity, lower costs and faster decisions. Most importantly, in contrast to studies which report a decline in participation over time for other frameworks, SNS DAOs exhibit sustained or increasing engagement levels over time.

Abstract: Collaborative content generation (CCG) enables collective creation of artifacts like scientific articles. Quality is a paramount concern in CCG, and a multitude of methods have been proposed to evaluate the quality of artifacts. Nevertheless, the majority of these methods are reliant on centralized architectures, which present challenges pertaining to security, privacy, and availability. Blockchain technology proffers a potential resolution to these challenges, by furnishing a decentralized and immutable ledger of quality scores. In this manuscript, we introduce a blockchain-based quality control model for CCG that uses a semi-iterative algorithm to interdependently compute quality scores of artifacts and reputation of nodes. Our model addresses critical challenges in academic informetrics, such as citation manipulation, transparency in collaborative scholarship, and decentralized trust in metric computation. Our model also exhibits sensitivity to processing latency, rendering it more agile in the presence of delays. Our model's quality scores, evaluated against PageRank and HITS baselines, show comparable performance, with additional assessments of throughput, latency, and robustness against malicious nodes confirming its reliability. A theoretical comparison with recent studies validates its feasibility for real world informetric application.

Abstract: This paper presents MPC-EVM, the first blockchain prototype that extends the EVM to enable asynchronous MPC invocations by smart contracts during transaction executions without compromising consistency or throughput. MPC-EVM uses an asynchronous execution model to process MPC-invoking transactions in a non-blocking fashion, saving the transaction's progress when it enters an MPC and resuming its execution upon MPC's completion. Additionally, it employs an access control mechanism that prevents inconsistent state access and modifications as a result of asynchronous executions. Benchmarking MPC-EVM's throughput show that the transactions per second (TPS) decreased by less than 3% compared to the baseline when MPC-invoking transactions are executed alongside regular transactions.

Abstract: Due to the distributed nature of federated learning (FL), the vulnerability of the global model and the need for coordination among many client devices pose significant challenges. As a promising decentralized, scalable and secure solution, blockchain-based FL methods have attracted widespread attention in recent years. However, traditional consensus mechanisms designed for Proof of Work (PoW) similar to blockchain incur substantial resource consumption and compromise the efficiency of FL, particularly when participating devices are wireless and resource-limited. To address asynchronous client participation and data heterogeneity in FL, while limiting the additional resource overhead introduced by blockchain, we propose the Directed Acyclic Graph-based Asynchronous Federated Learning (DAG-AFL) framework. We develop a tip selection algorithm that considers temporal freshness, node reachability and model accuracy, with a DAG-based trusted verification strategy. Extensive experiments on 3 benchmarking datasets against eight state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate that DAG-AFL significantly improves training efficiency and model accuracy by 22.7% and 6.5% on average, respectively.

Abstract: A widespread belief in the blockchain security community is that automated techniques are only good for detecting shallow bugs, typically of small value. In this paper, we present the techniques and insights that have led us to repeatable success in automatically discovering high-value smart contract vulnerabilities. Our vulnerability disclosures have yielded 10 bug bounties, for a total of over $3M, over high-profile deployed code, as well as hundreds of bugs detected in pre-deployment or under-audit code.
  We argue that the elements of this surprising success are a) a very high-completeness static analysis approach that manages to maintain acceptable precision; b) domain knowledge, provided by experts or captured via statistical inference. We present novel techniques for automatically inferring domain knowledge from statistical analysis of a large corpus of deployed contracts, as well as discuss insights on the ideal precision and warning rate of a promising vulnerability detector. In contrast to academic literature in program analysis, which routinely expects false-positive rates below 50% for publishable results, we posit that a useful analysis for high-value real-world vulnerabilities will likely flag very few programs (under 1%) and will do so with a high false-positive rate (e.g., 95%, meaning that only one-of-twenty human inspections will yield an exploitable vulnerability).

Abstract: Accurate and robust localization is critical for the safe operation of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), especially in complex urban environments where Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are unreliable. This paper presents a novel vision-based cooperative localization algorithm that leverages onboard cameras and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to enable CAVs to estimate their poses, even in occlusion-heavy scenarios such as busy intersections. In particular, we propose a novel decentralized observer for a group of connected agents that includes landmark agents (static or moving) in the environment with known positions and vehicle agents that need to estimate their poses (both positions and orientations). Assuming that (i) there are at least three landmark agents in the environment, (ii) each vehicle agent can measure its own angular and translational velocities as well as relative bearings to at least three neighboring landmarks or vehicles, and (iii) neighboring vehicles can communicate their pose estimates, each vehicle can estimate its own pose using the proposed decentralized observer. We prove that the origin of the estimation error is locally exponentially stable under the proposed observer, provided that the minimal observability conditions are satisfied. Moreover, we evaluate the proposed approach through experiments with real 1/10th-scale connected vehicles and large-scale simulations, demonstrating its scalability and validating the theoretical guarantees in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Smart contract comment generation has gained traction as a means to improve code comprehension and maintainability in blockchain systems. However, evaluating the quality of generated comments remains a challenge. Traditional metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture domain-specific nuances, while human evaluation is costly and unscalable. In this paper, we present \texttt{evalSmarT}, a modular and extensible framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as evaluators. The system supports over 400 evaluator configurations by combining approximately 40 LLMs with 10 prompting strategies. We demonstrate its application in benchmarking comment generation tools and selecting the most informative outputs. Our results show that prompt design significantly impacts alignment with human judgment, and that LLM-based evaluation offers a scalable and semantically rich alternative to existing methods.

<title>\textit{FedABC}: Attention-Based Client Selection for Federated Learning with Long-Term View</title>

Abstract: Native AI support is a key objective in the evolution of 6G networks, with Federated Learning (FL) emerging as a promising paradigm. FL allows decentralized clients to collaboratively train an AI model without directly sharing their data, preserving privacy. Clients train local models on private data and share model updates, which a central server aggregates to refine the global model and redistribute it for the next iteration. However, client data heterogeneity slows convergence and reduces model accuracy, and frequent client participation imposes communication and computational burdens. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{FedABC}, an innovative client selection algorithm designed to take a long-term view in managing data heterogeneity and optimizing client participation. Inspired by attention mechanisms, \textit{FedABC} prioritizes informative clients by evaluating both model similarity and each model's unique contributions to the global model. Moreover, considering the evolving demands of the global model, we formulate an optimization problem to guide \textit{FedABC} throughout the training process. Following the ``later-is-better" principle, \textit{FedABC} adaptively adjusts the client selection threshold, encouraging greater participation in later training stages. Extensive simulations on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that \textit{FedABC} significantly outperforms existing approaches in model accuracy and client participation efficiency, achieving comparable performance with 32\% fewer clients than the classical FL algorithm \textit{FedAvg}, and 3.5\% higher accuracy with 2\% fewer clients than the state-of-the-art. This work marks a step toward deploying FL in heterogeneous, resource-constrained environments, thereby supporting native AI capabilities in 6G networks.

<title>Deep Reputation Scoring in DeFi: zScore-Based Wallet Ranking from Liquidity and Trading Signals</title>

Abstract: As decentralized finance (DeFi) evolves, distinguishing between user behaviors - liquidity provision versus active trading - has become vital for risk modeling and on-chain reputation. We propose a behavioral scoring framework for Uniswap that assigns two complementary scores: a Liquidity Provision Score that assesses strategic liquidity contributions, and a Swap Behavior Score that reflects trading intent, volatility exposure, and discipline. The scores are constructed using rule-based blueprints that decompose behavior into volume, frequency, holding time, and withdrawal patterns. To handle edge cases and learn feature interactions, we introduce a deep residual neural network with densely connected skip blocks inspired by the U-Net architecture. We also incorporate pool-level context such as total value locked (TVL), fee tiers, and pool size, allowing the system to differentiate similar user behaviors across pools with varying characteristics. Our framework enables context-aware and scalable DeFi user scoring, supporting improved risk assessment and incentive design. Experiments on Uniswap v3 data show its usefulness for user segmentation and protocol-aligned reputation systems. Although we refer to our metric as zScore, it is independently developed and methodologically different from the cross-protocol system proposed by Udupi et al. Our focus is on role-specific behavioral modeling within Uniswap using blueprint logic and supervised learning.

<title>How to Save My Gas Fees: Understanding and Detecting Real-world Gas Issues in Solidity Programs</title>

Abstract: The execution of smart contracts on Ethereum, a public blockchain system, incurs a fee called gas fee for its computation and data storage. When programmers develop smart contracts (e.g., in the Solidity programming language), they could unknowingly write code snippets that unnecessarily cause more gas fees. These issues, or what we call gas wastes, can lead to significant monetary losses for users. This paper takes the initiative in helping Ethereum users reduce their gas fees in two key steps. First, we conduct an empirical study on gas wastes in open-source Solidity programs and Ethereum transaction traces. Second, to validate our study findings, we develop a static tool called PeCatch to effectively detect gas wastes in Solidity programs, and manually examine the Solidity compiler's code to pinpoint implementation errors causing gas wastes. Overall, we make 11 insights and four suggestions, which can foster future tool development and programmer awareness, and fixing our detected bugs can save $0.76 million in gas fees daily.

Abstract: This paper introduces a trade ordering rule that aims to reduce intra-block price volatility in Automated Market Maker (AMM) powered decentralized exchanges. The ordering rule introduced here, Clever Look-ahead Volatility Reduction (CLVR), operates under the (common) framework in decentralized finance that allows some entities to observe trade requests before they are settled, assemble them into "blocks", and order them as they like. On AMM exchanges, asset prices are continuously and transparently updated as a result of each trade and therefore, transaction order has high financial value. CLVR aims to order transactions for traders' benefit. Our primary focus is intra-block price stability (minimizing volatility), which has two main benefits for traders: it reduces transaction failure rate and allows traders to receive closer prices to the reference price at which they submit their transactions accordingly. We show that CLVR constructs an ordering which approximately minimizes price volatility with a small computation cost and can be trivially verified externally.

Abstract: Current marketplaces rely on search mechanisms with distributed systems but centralized governance, making them vulnerable to attacks, failures, censorship and biases. While search mechanisms with more decentralized governance (e.g., DeSearch) have been recently proposed, these are still exposed to information head-start attacks (IHS) despite the use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These attacks allow malicious users to gain a head-start over other users for the discovery of new assets in the market, which give them an unfair advantage in asset acquisition. We propose COoL-TEE, a TEE-based provider selection mechanism for distributed search, running in single- or multi-datacenter environments, that is resilient to information head-start attacks. COoL-TEE relies on a Client-TEE collaboration, which enables clients to distinguish between slow providers and malicious ones. Performance evaluations in single- and multi-datacenter environments show that, using COoL-TEE, malicious users respectively gain only up to 2% and 7% of assets more than without IHS, while they can claim 20% or more on top of their fair share in the same conditions with DeSearch.

<title>VGS-ATD: Robust Distributed Learning for Multi-Label Medical Image Classification Under Heterogeneous and Imbalanced Conditions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18657</link>

Abstract: In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong performance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30 datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming its superior efficiency and scalability.

<title>Bridging Cloud Convenience and Protocol Transparency: A Hybrid Architecture for Ethereum Node Operations on Amazon Managed Blockchain</title>

Abstract: As blockchain technologies are increasingly adopted in enterprise and research domains, the need for secure, scalable, and performance-transparent node infrastructure has become critical. While self-hosted Ethereum nodes offer operational control, they often lack elasticity and require complex maintenance. This paper presents a hybrid, service-oriented architecture for deploying and monitoring Ethereum full nodes using Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB), integrated with EC2-based observability, IAM-enforced security policies, and reproducible automation via the AWS Cloud Development Kit. Our architecture supports end-to-end observability through custom EC2 scripts leveraging Web3.py and JSON-RPC, collecting over 1,000 real-time data points-including gas utilization, transaction inclusion latency, and mempool dynamics. These metrics are visualized and monitored through AWS CloudWatch, enabling service-level performance tracking and anomaly detection. This cloud-native framework restores low-level observability lost in managed environments while maintaining the operational simplicity of managed services. By bridging the simplicity of AMB with the transparency required for protocol research and enterprise monitoring, this work delivers one of the first reproducible, performance-instrumented Ethereum deployments on AMB. The proposed hybrid architecture enables secure, observable, and reproducible Ethereum node operations in cloud environments, suitable for both research and production use.

<title>Adapting to Fragmented and Evolving Data: A Fisher Information Perspective</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18996</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.18996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning systems operating in dynamic environments often face \textit{sequential covariate shift} (SCS), where input distributions evolve over time while the conditional distribution remains stable. We introduce FADE (Fisher-based Adaptation to Dynamic Environments), a lightweight and theoretically grounded framework for robust learning under SCS. FADE employs a shift-aware regularization mechanism anchored in Fisher information geometry, guiding adaptation by modulating parameter updates based on sensitivity and stability. To detect significant distribution changes, we propose a Cramer-Rao-informed shift signal that integrates KL divergence with temporal Fisher dynamics. Unlike prior methods requiring task boundaries, target supervision, or experience replay, FADE operates online with fixed memory and no access to target labels. Evaluated on seven benchmarks spanning vision, language, and tabular data, FADE achieves up to 19\% higher accuracy under severe shifts, outperforming methods such as TENT and DIW. FADE also generalizes naturally to federated learning by treating heterogeneous clients as temporally fragmented environments, enabling scalable and stable adaptation in decentralized settings. Theoretical analysis guarantees bounded regret and parameter consistency, while empirical results demonstrate FADE's robustness across modalities and shift intensities.

Abstract: Constraint-based optimization is a cornerstone of robotics, enabling the design of controllers that reliably encode task and safety requirements such as collision avoidance or formation adherence. However, handcrafted constraints can fail in multi-agent settings that demand complex coordination. We introduce ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate, context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines. We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the degree to which it relies on this controller.

Abstract: Energy systems generate vast amounts of data in extremely short time intervals, creating challenges for efficient data management. Traditional data management methods often struggle with scalability and accessibility, limiting their usefulness. More advanced solutions, such as NoSQL databases and cloud-based platforms, have been adopted to address these issues. Still, even these advanced solutions can encounter bottlenecks, which can impact the efficiency of data storage, retrieval, and analysis. This review paper explores the research trends in big data management for energy systems, highlighting the practices, opportunities and challenges. Also, the data regulatory demands are highlighted using chosen reference architectures. The review, in particular, explores the limitations of current storage and data integration solutions and examines how new technologies are applied to the energy sector. Novel insights into emerging technologies, including data spaces, various data management architectures, peer-to-peer data management, and blockchains, are provided, along with practical recommendations for achieving enhanced data sharing and regulatory compliance.

<title>SILS: Strategic Influence on Liquidity Stability and Whale Detection in Concentrated-Liquidity DEXs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19411</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods for identifying impactful liquidity providers (LPs) in Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) rely on broad measures, such as nominal capital size or surface-level activity, which often lead to inaccurate risk analysis. The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed approach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic systemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents a fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a dynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain event logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential Time-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly detection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through the Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that measures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This combined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an LP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used by existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables SILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by traditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective oracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing DeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the underlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the common false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in traditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for proactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their ecosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior.

<title>Finance as Extended Biology: Reciprocity as the Cognitive Substrate of Financial Behavior</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00099v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in economics and artificial intelligence is explaining how financial behaviors-such as credit, insurance, and trade-emerge without formal institutions. We argue that these functions are not products of institutional design, but structured extensions of a single behavioral substrate: reciprocity. Far from being a derived strategy, reciprocity served as the foundational logic of early human societies-governing the circulation of goods, regulation of obligation, and maintenance of long-term cooperation well before markets, money, or formal rules. Trade, commonly regarded as the origin of financial systems, is reframed here as the canonical form of reciprocity: simultaneous, symmetric, and partner-contingent. Building on this logic, we reconstruct four core financial functions-credit, insurance, token exchange, and investment-as expressions of the same underlying principle under varying conditions. By grounding financial behavior in minimal, simulateable dynamics of reciprocal interaction, this framework shifts the focus from institutional engineering to behavioral computation-offering a new foundation for modeling decentralized financial behavior in both human and artificial agents.

<title>Incentivised Orchestrated Training Architecture (IOTA): A Technical Primer for Release</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17766</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.17766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In August 2024, Bittensor's Subnet 9 (SN9) demonstrated that a distributed network of incentivized, permissionless actors could each pretrain large language models (LLMs) ranging from 700 million to 14 billion parameters, while surpassing established baselines. While that work validated blockchain-based decentralized pretraining as viable, it contained core issues: (i) every miner had to fit an entire model locally, and (ii) "winner-takes-all" rewards encouraged model hoarding.
  Here we introduce IOTA (Incentivized Orchestrated Training Architecture), an architecture that addresses these limitations by transforming SN9's previously isolated competitors into a single cooperating unit that can scale arbitrarily while still rewarding each contributor fairly.
  Key preliminary results: (1) Data- and Pipeline-parallel SWARM architecture - An orchestrator distributes model layers across heterogeneous miners and streams activations between them, enabling model sizes to scale with the number of participants rather than being constrained by the VRAM of a single machine; (2) Granular, continuous incentives - Validators measure each miner's contribution and allocate token emissions proportionally; (3) Activation compression - We used model-bottlenecks to cut communication bandwidths of activations by up to 128x, vastly improving training speed; (4) Butterfly All-Reduce - Miners average disjoint parameter slices in O(1) bandwidth, offering linear scalability, redundancy and built-in collusion detection; (5) CLASP (Contribution Loss Assessment via Sampling of Pathways) - A fair attribution scheme assigns credit to miners proportional to their marginal utility and detects exploits, even when contributions are interdependent across the pipeline.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances situational awareness in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Ad hoc networks of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) allow for real-time data sharing, but they face security challenges due to their decentralized nature, making them vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks. This paper introduces a trust-based framework for assured sensor fusion in distributed multi-agent networks, utilizing a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based approach to estimate the trustworthiness of agents and their provided information in a decentralized fashion. Trust-informed data fusion prioritizes fusing data from reliable sources, enhancing resilience and accuracy in contested environments. To evaluate the assured sensor fusion under attacks on system/mission sensing, we present a novel multi-agent aerial dataset built from the Unreal Engine simulator. We demonstrate through case studies improved ISR performance and an ability to detect malicious actors in adversarial settings.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm, where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning (ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged, allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities. In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution. MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across 6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

<title>Towards Microgrid Resilience Enhancement via Mobile Power Sources and Repair Crews: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18095</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.18095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile power sources (MPSs) have been gradually deployed in microgrids as critical resources to coordinate with repair crews (RCs) towards resilience enhancement owing to their flexibility and mobility in handling the complex coupled power-transport systems. However, previous work solves the coordinated dispatch problem of MPSs and RCs in a centralized manner with the assumption that the communication network is still fully functioning after the event. However, there is growing evidence that certain extreme events will damage or degrade communication infrastructure, which makes centralized decision making impractical. To fill this gap, this paper formulates the resilience-driven dispatch problem of MPSs and RCs in a decentralized framework. To solve this problem, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning method featuring a two-level framework is proposed, where the high-level action is used to switch decision-making between power and transport networks, and the low-level action constructed via a hybrid policy is used to compute continuous scheduling and discrete routing decisions in power and transport networks, respectively. The proposed method also uses an embedded function encapsulating system dynamics to enhance learning stability and scalability. Case studies based on IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus power networks are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in load restoration.

Abstract: High renewable penetration has been witnessed in power systems, resulting in reduced system inertia and increasing requirements for frequency response services. Electric vehicles (EVs), owing to their vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities, can provide cost-effective frequency services for transmission system operators (TSOs). However, EVs that are inherently connected to distribution networks may pose voltage security issues for distribution system operators (DSOs) when supporting TSO frequency. To coordinate both TSO frequency and DSO voltage, this paper proposes a two-stage service provision framework for multi-EVs. At stage one, EVs participate in day-ahead TSO-DSO interactions for frequency reserve schedules; at stage two, EVs make real-time dispatching behaviors in distribution networks for reserve delivery while supporting DSO voltage. Considering the potentially large EV number and environment complexity, a decentralized operation paradigm is introduced for real-time EV dispatches at stage two, while a communication-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to reduce the communication overhead during large-scale multi-agent RL training without compromising policy performance. Case studies are carried out on a 6-bus transmission and 33-bus distribution network as well as a 69-bus distribution network to evaluate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method in enabling EVs for frequency service and voltage support.

Abstract: We consider the problem of designing learning-based reactive power controllers that perform voltage regulation in distribution grids while ensuring closed-loop system stability. In contrast to existing methods, where the provably stable controllers are restricted to be decentralized, we propose a unified design framework that enables the controllers to take advantage of an arbitrary communication infrastructure on top of the physical power network. This allows the controllers to incorporate information beyond their local bus, covering existing methods as a special case and leading to less conservative constraints on the controller design. We then provide a design procedure to construct input convex neural network (ICNN) based controllers that satisfy the identified stability constraints by design under arbitrary communication scenarios, and train these controllers using supervised learning. Simulation results on the the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) microgrid testbed illustrate the effectiveness of the framework and highlight the role of communication in improving control performance.

<title>CASPER: Contrastive Approach for Smart Ponzi Scheme Detecter with More Negative Samples</title>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of digital currency trading, fueled by the integration of blockchain technology, has led to both innovation and the emergence of smart Ponzi schemes. A smart Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation in smart contract that uses funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors. Traditional Ponzi scheme detection methods based on deep learning typically rely on fully supervised models, which require large amounts of labeled data. However, such data is often scarce, hindering effective model training. To address this challenge, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework, CASPER (Contrastive Approach for Smart Ponzi detectER with more negative samples), designed to enhance smart Ponzi scheme detection in blockchain transactions. By leveraging contrastive learning techniques, CASPER can learn more effective representations of smart contract source code using unlabeled datasets, significantly reducing both operational costs and system complexity. We evaluate CASPER on the XBlock dataset, where it outperforms the baseline by 2.3% in F1 score when trained with 100% labeled data. More impressively, with only 25% labeled data, CASPER achieves an F1 score nearly 20% higher than the baseline under identical experimental conditions. These results highlight CASPER's potential for effective and cost-efficient detection of smart Ponzi schemes, paving the way for scalable fraud detection solutions in the future.

Abstract: Following the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters increasingly migrated from mainstream social media plat-forms like X (formerly Twitter) to decentralized alternatives such as Bluesky. This study investigates how Congressional Democrats use Bluesky to form networks of influence and disseminate political messaging in a platform environment that lacks algorithmic amplification. We employ a mixed-methods approach that combines social network analysis, expo-nential random graph modeling (ERGM), and transformer-based topic mod-eling (BERTopic) to analyze follows, mentions, reposts, and discourse pat-terns among 182 verified Democratic members of Congress. Our findings show that while party leaders such as Hakeem Jeffries and Elizabeth War-ren dominate visibility metrics, overlooked figures like Marcy Kaptur, Donald Beyer, and Dwight Evans occupy structurally central positions, suggesting latent influence within the digital party ecosystem. ERGM re-sults reveal significant homophily along ideological, state, and leadership lines, with Senate leadership exhibiting lower connectivity. Topic analysis identifies both shared themes (e.g., reproductive rights, foreign conflicts) and subgroup-specific issues, with The Squad showing the most distinct discourse profile. These results demonstrate the potential of decentralized platforms to reshape intra-party communication dynamics and highlight the need for continued computational research on elite political behavior in emerging digital environments.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities, making them essential for several downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning these models at scale remains challenging, particularly in federated environments where data is decentralized and non-iid across clients. Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) reduce computational overhead but struggle with heterogeneous client data, leading to suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose FedVLM, a federated LoRA fine-tuning framework that enables decentralized adaptation of VLMs while preserving model privacy and reducing reliance on centralized training. To further tackle data heterogeneity, we introduce personalized LoRA (pLoRA), which dynamically adapts LoRA parameters to each client's unique data distribution, significantly improving local adaptation while maintaining global model aggregation. Experiments on the RLAIF-V dataset show that pLoRA improves client-specific performance by 24.5% over standard LoRA, demonstrating superior adaptation in non-iid settings. FedVLM provides a scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning VLMs in federated settings, advancing personalized adaptation in distributed learning scenarios.

Abstract: Global health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have exposed critical weaknesses in traditional medical supply chains, including inefficiencies in resource allocation, lack of transparency, and poor adaptability to dynamic disruptions. This paper presents a novel hybrid framework that integrates blockchain technology with a decentralized, large language model (LLM) powered multi-agent negotiation system to enhance the resilience and accountability of medical supply chains during crises. In this system, autonomous agents-representing manufacturers, distributors, and healthcare institutions-engage in structured, context-aware negotiation and decision-making processes facilitated by LLMs, enabling rapid and ethical allocation of scarce medical resources. The off-chain agent layer supports adaptive reasoning and local decision-making, while the on-chain blockchain layer ensures immutable, transparent, and auditable enforcement of decisions via smart contracts. The framework also incorporates a formal cross-layer communication protocol to bridge decentralized negotiation with institutional enforcement. A simulation environment emulating pandemic scenarios evaluates the system's performance, demonstrating improvements in negotiation efficiency, fairness of allocation, supply chain responsiveness, and auditability. This research contributes an innovative approach that synergizes blockchain trust guarantees with the adaptive intelligence of LLM-driven agents, providing a robust and scalable solution for critical supply chain coordination under uncertainty.

Abstract: Federated learning is a paradigm of increasing relevance in real world applications, aimed at building a global model across a network of heterogeneous users without requiring the sharing of private data. We focus on model learning over decentralized architectures, where users collaborate directly to update the global model without relying on a central server. In this context, the current paper proposes a novel approach to collaboratively learn probabilistic generative classifiers with a parametric form. The framework is composed by a communication network over a set of local nodes, each of one having its own local data, and a local updating rule. The proposal involves sharing local statistics with neighboring nodes, where each node aggregates the neighbors' information and iteratively learns its own local classifier, which progressively converges to a global model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the algorithm consistently converges to a globally competitive model across a wide range of network topologies, network sizes, local dataset sizes, and extreme non-i.i.d. data distributions.

Abstract: This paper addresses decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD) over resource-constrained networks by introducing node-based and link-based scheduling strategies to enhance communication efficiency. In each iteration of the D-SGD algorithm, only a few disjoint subsets of nodes or links are randomly activated, subject to a given communication cost constraint. We propose a novel importance metric based on information entropy to determine node and link scheduling probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations, comparing it against state-of-the-art methods, including betweenness centrality (BC) for node scheduling and \textit{MATCHA} for link scheduling. The results show that our method consistently outperforms the BC-based method in the node scheduling case, achieving faster convergence with up to 60\% lower communication budgets. At higher communication budgets (above 60\%), our method maintains comparable or superior performance. In the link scheduling case, our method delivers results that are superior to or on par with those of \textit{MATCHA}.

Abstract: Participatory budgeting is a method of collectively understanding and addressing spending priorities where citizens vote on how a budget is spent, it is regularly run to improve the fairness of the distribution of public funds. Participatory budgeting requires voters to make decisions on projects which can lead to ``choice overload". A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to decision support can make decision making easier for voters by identifying voting strategies that increase the winning proportion of their vote. This novel approach can also support policymakers by highlighting aspects of election design that enable fair compromise on projects. This paper presents a novel, ethically aligned approach to decision support using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning modelling. This paper introduces a novel use of a branching neural network architecture to overcome scalability challenges of multi-agent reinforcement learning in a decentralized way. Fair compromises are found through optimising voter actions towards greater representation of voter preferences in the winning set. Experimental evaluation with real-world participatory budgeting data reveals a pattern in fair compromise: that it is achievable through projects with smaller cost.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become increasingly popular across different sectors, offering a way for clients to work together to train a global model without sharing sensitive data. It involves multiple rounds of communication between the global model and participating clients, which introduces several challenges like high communication costs, heterogeneous client data, prolonged processing times, and increased vulnerability to privacy threats. In recent years, the convergence of federated learning and parameterized quantum circuits has sparked significant research interest, with promising implications for fields such as healthcare and finance. By enabling decentralized training of quantum models, it allows clients or institutions to collaboratively enhance model performance and outcomes while preserving data privacy. Recognizing that Fisher information can quantify the amount of information that a quantum state carries under parameter changes, thereby providing insight into its geometric and statistical properties. We intend to leverage this property to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we propose a Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) algorithm that makes use of the Fisher information computed on local client models, with data distributed across heterogeneous partitions. This approach identifies the critical parameters that significantly influence the quantum model's performance, ensuring they are preserved during the aggregation process. Our research assessed the effectiveness and feasibility of QFL by comparing its performance against other variants, and exploring the benefits of incorporating Fisher information in QFL settings. Experimental results on ADNI and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving better performance and robustness against the quantum federated averaging method.

Abstract: As organizations rapidly migrate to the cloud, the security of cryptographic key management has become a growing concern. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), traditionally seen as the gold standard for securing encryption keys and digital trust, are increasingly challenged by cloud-native threats. Real-world breaches have exposed weaknesses in cloud deployments, including misconfigurations, API abuse, and privilege escalations, allowing attackers to access sensitive key material and bypass protections. These incidents reveal that while the hardware remains secure, the surrounding cloud ecosystem introduces systemic vulnerabilities. This paper analyzes notable security failures involving HSMs and TPMs, identifies common attack vectors, and questions longstanding assumptions about their effectiveness in distributed environments. We explore alternative approaches such as confidential computing, post-quantum cryptography, and decentralized key management. Our findings highlight that while HSMs and TPMs still play a role, modern cloud security requires more adaptive, layered architectures. By evaluating both current weaknesses and emerging models, this research equips cloud architects and security engineers with strategies to reinforce cryptographic trust in the evolving threat landscape.

Abstract: The digital art market faces unprecedented challenges in authenticity verification and copyright protection. This study introduces an integrated framework to address these issues by combining neural style transfer, fractal analysis, and blockchain technology. We generate abstract artworks inspired by Jackson Pollock, using their inherent mathematical complexity to create robust, imperceptible watermarks. Our method embeds these watermarks, derived from fractal and turbulence features, directly into the artwork's structure. This approach is then secured by linking the watermark to NFT metadata, ensuring immutable proof of ownership. Rigorous testing shows our feature-based watermarking achieves a 76.2% average detection rate against common attacks, significantly outperforming traditional methods (27.8-44.0%). This work offers a practical solution for digital artists and collectors, enhancing security and trust in the digital art ecosystem.

Abstract: Unauthorized access remains one of the critical security challenges in the realm of cybersecurity. With the increasing sophistication of attack techniques, the threat of unauthorized access is no longer confined to the conventional ones, such as exploiting weak access control policies. Instead, advanced exploitation strategies, such as session hijacking-based attacks, are becoming increasingly prevalent, posing serious security concerns. Session hijacking enables attackers to take over an already established session between legitimate peers in a stealthy manner, thereby gaining unauthorized access to private resources. Unfortunately, traditional access control mechanisms, such as static access control policies, are insufficient to prevent session hijacking or other advanced exploitation techniques. In this work, we propose a new multi-factor authorization (MFAz) scheme that proactively mitigates unauthorized access attempts both conventional and advanced unauthorized access attacks. The proposed scheme employs fine-grained access control rules (ARs) and verification points (VPs) that are systematically generated from historically granted accesses as the first and second authorization factors, respectively. As a proof-of-concept, we implement the scheme using different techniques. We leverage bloom filter to achieve runtime and storage efficiency, and blockchain to make authorization decisions in a temper-proof and decentralized manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first formal introduction of a multi-factor authorization scheme, which is orthogonal to the multi-factor authentication (MFA) schemes. The effectiveness of our proposed scheme is experimentally evaluated using a smart-city testbed involving different devices with varying computational capacities. The experimental results reveal high effectiveness of the scheme both in security and performance guarantees.

<title>DP2Guard: A Lightweight and Byzantine-Robust Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Scheme for Industrial IoT</title>

Abstract: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) has emerged as a secure distributed Machine Learning (ML) paradigm that aggregates locally trained gradients without exposing raw data. To defend against model poisoning threats, several robustness-enhanced PPFL schemes have been proposed by integrating anomaly detection. Nevertheless, they still face two major challenges: (1) the reliance on heavyweight encryption techniques results in substantial communication and computation overhead; and (2) single-strategy defense mechanisms often fail to provide sufficient robustness against adaptive adversaries. To overcome these challenges, we propose DP2Guard, a lightweight PPFL framework that enhances both privacy and robustness. DP2Guard leverages a lightweight gradient masking mechanism to replace costly cryptographic operations while ensuring the privacy of local gradients. A hybrid defense strategy is proposed, which extracts gradient features using singular value decomposition and cosine similarity, and applies a clustering algorithm to effectively identify malicious gradients. Additionally, DP2Guard adopts a trust score-based adaptive aggregation scheme that adjusts client weights according to historical behavior, while blockchain records aggregated results and trust scores to ensure tamper-proof and auditable training. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets demonstrate that DP2Guard effectively defends against four advanced poisoning attacks while ensuring privacy with reduced communication and computation costs.

Abstract: Mapping deep neural networks (DNNs) to hardware is critical for optimizing latency, energy consumption, and resource utilization, making it a cornerstone of high-performance accelerator design. Due to the vast and complex mapping space, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach-but its effectiveness is often limited by sample inefficiency. We present a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to overcome this challenge. By distributing the search across multiple agents, our framework accelerates exploration. To avoid inefficiencies from training multiple agents in parallel, we introduce an agent clustering algorithm that assigns similar mapping parameters to the same agents based on correlation analysis. This enables a decentralized, parallelized learning process that significantly improves sample efficiency. Experimental results show our MARL approach improves sample efficiency by 30-300x over standard single-agent RL, achieving up to 32.61x latency reduction and 16.45x energy-delay product (EDP) reduction under iso-sample conditions.

Abstract: In an increasingly complex contractual landscape, the demand for transparency, security, and efficiency has intensified. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable nature, addresses these challenges by reducing intermediary costs, minimizing fraud risks, and enhancing system compatibility. Smart contracts, initially conceptualized by Nick Szabo and later implemented on the Ethereum blockchain, automate and secure contractual clauses, offering a robust solution for various industries. However, their complexity and the requirement for advanced programming skills present significant barriers to widespread adoption. This study introduces a multi-level finite state machine model designed to represent and track the execution of smart contracts. Our model aims to simplify smart contract development by providing a formalized framework that abstracts underlying technical complexities, making it accessible to professionals without deep technical expertise. The hierarchical structure of the multi-level finite state machine enhances contract modularity and traceability, facilitating detailed representation and evaluation of functional properties. The paper explores the potential of this multi-level approach, reviewing existing methodologies and tools, and detailing the smart contract generation process with an emphasis on reusable components and modularity. We also conduct a security analysis to evaluate potential vulnerabilities in our model, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the generated smart contracts.

Abstract: Persistent monitoring of dynamic targets is essential in real-world applications such as disaster response, environmental sensing, and wildlife conservation, where mobile agents must continuously gather information under uncertainty. We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.

Abstract: Blockchain systems have been a part of mainstream academic research, and a hot topic at that. It has spread to almost every subfield in the computer science literature, as well as economics and finance. Especially in a world where digital trust is much sought for, blockchains offer a rich variety of desired properties, such as immutability, public auditing, decentralised record keeping, among others. Not only has it been a research topic of its own, the integration of blockchains into other systems has been proposed as solutions in many areas, ranging from grid computing, cloud and fog computing, to internet of things, self driving vehicles , and smart cities. In many cases the primary function attributed to blockchains in these contexts is resource management. Although much attention is paid to this topic, the focus is on single resource allocation scenarios. Even the cases where multiple resource types are to be allocated, are treated as single resource type scenarios, and problems are formulated as allocating standardised bundles consisting of a fixed amount of each of them, such as virtual machines. The present study addresses the problem of allocating multiple resource types among tasks with heterogeneous resource demands with a smart contract adaptation of Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness; an algorithm that approximates Dominant Resource Fairness, without loop iterations, which makes it preferable in the blockchain context because of the block gas limit. We present the resulting algorithm, Autonomous Dominant Resource Fairness, along with the empirical data collected from the tests run on the algorithm. The results show that Autonomous Dominant Resource Fairness is a gas-cost efficient algorithm, which can be used to manage hundreds of resource types for unlimited number of users.

Abstract: In the era of big data applications, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has emerged as a prominent solution that reconcile the tradeoff between optimizing the collective intelligence between decentralized datasets holders and preserving sensitive information to maximum. Existing FGL surveys have contributed meaningfully but largely focus on integrating Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Machine Learning (GML), resulting in early stage taxonomies that emphasis on methodology and simulated scenarios. Notably, a data centric perspective, which systematically examines FGL methods through the lens of data properties and usage, remains unadapted to reorganize FGL research, yet it is critical to assess how FGL studies manage to tackle data centric constraints to enhance model performances. This survey propose a two-level data centric taxonomy: Data Characteristics, which categorizes studies based on the structural and distributional properties of datasets used in FGL, and Data Utilization, which analyzes the training procedures and techniques employed to overcome key data centric challenges. Each taxonomy level is defined by three orthogonal criteria, each representing a distinct data centric configuration. Beyond taxonomy, this survey examines FGL integration with Pretrained Large Models, showcases realistic applications, and highlights future direction aligned with emerging trends in GML.

Abstract: Efficient planning of activities is essential for modern industrial assembly lines to uphold manufacturing standards, prevent project constraint violations, and achieve cost-effective operations. While exact solutions to such challenges can be obtained through Integer Programming (IP), the dependence of the search space on input parameters often makes IP computationally infeasible for large-scale scenarios. Heuristic methods, such as Genetic Algorithms, can also be applied, but they frequently produce suboptimal solutions in extensive cases. This paper introduces a novel mathematical model of a generic industrial assembly line formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), without imposing assumptions on the type of assembly line a notable distinction from most existing models. The proposed model is employed to create a virtual environment for training Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents to optimize task and resource scheduling. To enhance the efficiency of agent training, the paper proposes two innovative tools. The first is an action-masking technique, which ensures the agent selects only feasible actions, thereby reducing training time. The second is a multi-agent approach, where each workstation is managed by an individual agent, as a result, the state and action spaces were reduced. A centralized training framework with decentralized execution is adopted, offering a scalable learning architecture for optimizing industrial assembly lines. This framework allows the agents to learn offline and subsequently provide real-time solutions during operations by leveraging a neural network that maps the current factory state to the optimal action. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating significantly faster convergence to the optimal solution compared to a comparable model-based approach.

Abstract: The next generation of Department of Energy supercomputers will be capable of exascale computation. For these machines, far more computation will be possible than that which can be saved to disk. As a result, users will be unable to rely on post-hoc access to data for uncertainty quantification and other statistical analyses and there will be an urgent need for sophisticated machine learning algorithms which can be trained in situ. Algorithms deployed in this setting must be highly scalable, memory efficient and capable of handling data which is distributed across nodes as spatially contiguous partitions. One suitable approach involves fitting a sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) model independently and in parallel to each spatial partition. The resulting model is scalable, efficient and generally accurate, but produces the undesirable effect of constructing discontinuous response surfaces due to the disagreement between neighboring models at their shared boundary. In this paper, we extend this idea by allowing for a small amount of communication between neighboring spatial partitions which encourages better alignment of the local models, leading to smoother spatial predictions and a better fit in general. Due to our decentralized communication scheme, the proposed extension remains highly scalable and adds very little overhead in terms of computation (and none, in terms of memory). We demonstrate this Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP) approach for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and compare the results to the independent SVGP case.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) appear to be powerful tools to learn state representations for agents in distributed, decentralized multi-agent systems, but generate catastrophically incorrect predictions when nodes update asynchronously during inference. This failure under asynchrony effectively excludes these architectures from many potential applications where synchrony is difficult or impossible to enforce, e.g., robotic swarms or sensor networks. In this work we identify "implicitly-defined" GNNs as a class of architectures which is provably robust to asynchronous "hogwild" inference, adapting convergence guarantees from work in asynchronous and distributed optimization. We then propose a novel implicitly-defined GNN architecture, which we call an 'energy GNN'. We show that this architecture outperforms other GNNs from this class on a variety of synthetic tasks inspired by multi-agent systems.

Abstract: How AI models should deal with political topics has been discussed, but it remains challenging and requires better governance. This paper examines the governance of large language models through individual and collective deliberation, focusing on politically sensitive videos. We conducted a two-step study: interviews with 10 journalists established a baseline understanding of expert video interpretation; 114 individuals through deliberation using InclusiveAI, a platform that facilitates democratic decision-making through decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) mechanisms. Our findings reveal distinct differences in interpretative priorities: while experts emphasized emotion and narrative, the general public prioritized factual clarity, objectivity, and emotional neutrality. Furthermore, we examined how different governance mechanisms - quadratic vs. weighted voting and equal vs. 20/80 voting power - shape users' decision-making regarding AI behavior. Results indicate that voting methods significantly influence outcomes, with quadratic voting reinforcing perceptions of liberal democracy and political equality. Our study underscores the necessity of selecting appropriate governance mechanisms to better capture user perspectives and suggests decentralized AI governance as a potential way to facilitate broader public engagement in AI development, ensuring that varied perspectives meaningfully inform design decisions.

<title>FedStrategist: A Meta-Learning Framework for Adaptive and Robust Aggregation in Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a paradigm for privacy-preserving collaborative AI, but its decentralized nature creates significant vulnerabilities to model poisoning attacks. While numerous static defenses exist, their effectiveness is highly context-dependent, often failing against adaptive adversaries or in heterogeneous data environments. This paper introduces FedStrategist, a novel meta-learning framework that reframes robust aggregation as a real-time, cost-aware control problem. We design a lightweight contextual bandit agent that dynamically selects the optimal aggregation rule from an arsenal of defenses based on real-time diagnostic metrics. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that no single static rule is universally optimal. We show that our adaptive agent successfully learns superior policies across diverse scenarios, including a ``Krum-favorable" environment and against a sophisticated "stealth" adversary designed to neutralize specific diagnostic signals. Critically, we analyze the paradoxical scenario where a non-robust baseline achieves high but compromised accuracy, and demonstrate that our agent learns a conservative policy to prioritize model integrity. Furthermore, we prove the agent's policy is controllable via a single "risk tolerance" parameter, allowing practitioners to explicitly manage the trade-off between performance and security. Our work provides a new, practical, and analyzable approach to creating resilient and intelligent decentralized AI systems.

<title>FORTA: Byzantine-Resilient FL Aggregation via DFT-Guided Krum</title>

Abstract: Secure federated learning enables collaborative model training across decentralized users while preserving data privacy. A key component is secure aggregation, which keeps individual updates hidden from both the server and users, while also defending against Byzantine users who corrupt the aggregation. To this end, Jinhyun So et al. recently developed a Byzantine-resilient secure aggregation scheme using a secret-sharing strategy over finite-field arithmetic. However, such an approach can suffer from numerical errors and overflows when applied to real-valued model updates, motivating the need for secure aggregation methods that operate directly over the real domain. We propose FORTA, a Byzantine-resilient secure aggregation framework that operates entirely in the real domain. FORTA leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) codes for privacy and employs Krum-based outlier detection for robustness. While DFT decoder is error-free under infinite precision, finite precision introduces numerical perturbations that can distort distance estimates and allow malicious updates to evade detection. To address this, FORTA refines Krum using feedback from DFT decoder, improving the selection of trustworthy updates. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that our modification of Krum offers improved robustness and more accurate aggregation than standard Krum.

Abstract: Recent large-scale events like election fraud and financial scams have shown how harmful coordinated efforts by human groups can be. With the rise of autonomous AI systems, there is growing concern that AI-driven groups could also cause similar harm. While most AI safety research focuses on individual AI systems, the risks posed by multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex real-world situations are still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a proof-of-concept to simulate the risks of malicious MAS collusion, using a flexible framework that supports both centralized and decentralized coordination structures. We apply this framework to two high-risk fields: misinformation spread and e-commerce fraud. Our findings show that decentralized systems are more effective at carrying out malicious actions than centralized ones. The increased autonomy of decentralized systems allows them to adapt their strategies and cause more damage. Even when traditional interventions, like content flagging, are applied, decentralized groups can adjust their tactics to avoid detection. We present key insights into how these malicious groups operate and the need for better detection systems and countermeasures. Code is available at https://github.com/renqibing/RogueAgent.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data, making it a promising approach for privacy-sensitive domains. Despite its potential, FL faces significant challenges, particularly in terms of communication overhead and data privacy. Privacy-preserving Techniques (PPTs) such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) have been used to mitigate these concerns. However, these techniques introduce substantial computational and communication costs, limiting their practical deployment. In this work, we explore how Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE), a cryptographic protocol that combines symmetric encryption with HE, can be effectively integrated with FL to address both communication and privacy challenges, paving the way for scalable and secure decentralized learning system.

<title>Byzantine-Robust Decentralized Coordination of LLM Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14928</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14928</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.14928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaboration among multiple large language model (LLM) agents is a promising approach to overcome inherent limitations of single-agent systems, such as hallucinations and single points of failure. As LLM agents are increasingly deployed on open blockchain platforms, multi-agent systems capable of tolerating malicious (Byzantine) agents have become essential.
  Recent Byzantine-robust multi-agent systems typically rely on leader-driven coordination, which suffers from two major drawbacks. First, they are inherently vulnerable to targeted attacks against the leader. If consecutive leaders behave maliciously, the system repeatedly fails to achieve consensus, forcing new consensus rounds, which is particularly costly given the high latency of LLM invocations. Second, an underperforming proposal from the leader can be accepted as the final answer even when higher-quality alternatives are available, as existing methods finalize the leader's proposal once it receives a quorum of votes.
  To address these issues, we propose DecentLLMs, a novel decentralized consensus approach for multi-agent LLM systems, where worker agents generate answers concurrently and evaluator agents independently score and rank these answers to select the best available one. This decentralized architecture enables faster consensus despite the presence of Byzantine agents and consistently selects higher-quality answers through Byzantine-robust aggregation techniques.
  Experimental results demonstrate that DecentLLMs effectively tolerates Byzantine agents and significantly improves the quality of selected answers.

<title>FedWCM: Unleashing the Potential of Momentum-based Federated Learning in Long-Tailed Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving data privacy. Despite its benefits, FL faces challenges with non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, especially in long-tailed scenarios with imbalanced class samples. Momentum-based FL methods, often used to accelerate FL convergence, struggle with these distributions, resulting in biased models and making FL hard to converge. To understand this challenge, we conduct extensive investigations into this phenomenon, accompanied by a layer-wise analysis of neural network behavior. Based on these insights, we propose FedWCM, a method that dynamically adjusts momentum using global and per-round data to correct directional biases introduced by long-tailed distributions. Extensive experiments show that FedWCM resolves non-convergence issues and outperforms existing methods, enhancing FL's efficiency and effectiveness in handling client heterogeneity and data imbalance.

Abstract: Real-time peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity markets dynamically adapt to fluctuations in renewable energy and variations in demand, maximizing economic benefits through instantaneous price responses while enhancing grid flexibility. However, scaling expert guidance for massive personalized prosumers poses critical challenges, including diverse decision-making demands and lack of customized modeling frameworks. This paper proposed an integrated large language model-multi-agent reinforcement learning (LLM-MARL) framework for real-time P2P energy trading to address challenges such as the limited technical capability of prosumers, the lack of expert experience, and security issues of distribution networks. LLMs are introduced as experts to generate personalized strategy, guiding MARL under the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm through imitation learning. A differential attention-based critic network is designed to enhance convergence performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM generated strategies effectively substitute human experts. The proposed multi-agent imitation learning algorithms achieve significantly lower economic costs and voltage violation rates on test sets compared to baselines algorithms, while maintaining robust stability. This work provides an effective solution for real-time P2P electricity market decision-making by bridging expert knowledge with agent learning.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in AI/ML offer exciting opportunities to revolutionize analog design automation through data-driven approaches. In particular, researchers are increasingly fascinated by harnessing the power of generative AI to automate the discovery of novel analog circuit topologies. Unlocking the full potential of generative AI in these data-driven discoveries requires access to large and diverse datasets.Yet, there is a significant barrier in the analog domain--Analog circuit design is inherently proprietary, involving not only confidential circuit structures but also the underlying commercial semiconductor processes. As a result, current generative AI research is largely confined to individual researchers who construct small, narrowly focused private datasets. This fragmentation severely limits collaborative innovation and impedes progress across the research community. To address these challenges, we propose AnalogFed. AnalogFed enables collaborative topology discovery across decentralized clients (e.g., individual researchers or institutions) without requiring the sharing of raw private data. To make this vision practical, we introduce a suite of techniques tailored to the unique challenges of applying FedL in analog design--from generative model development and data heterogeneity handling to privacy-preserving strategies that ensure both flexibility and security for circuit designers and semiconductor manufacturers. Extensive experiments across varying client counts and dataset sizes demonstrate that AnalogFed achieves performance comparable to centralized baselines--while maintaining strict data privacy. Specifically, the generative AI model within AnalogFed achieves state-of-the-art efficiency and scalability in the design of analog circuit topologies.

<title>Joint-Local Grounded Action Transformation for Sim-to-Real Transfer in Multi-Agent Traffic Control</title>

Abstract: Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for managing urban traffic flow and reducing congestion. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an adaptive method for TSC by responding to dynamic traffic patterns, with multi-agent RL (MARL) gaining traction as intersections naturally function as coordinated agents. However, due to shifts in environmental dynamics, implementing MARL-based TSC policies in the real world often leads to a significant performance drop, known as the sim-to-real gap. Grounded Action Transformation (GAT) has successfully mitigated this gap in single-agent RL for TSC, but real-world traffic networks, which involve numerous interacting intersections, are better suited to a MARL framework. In this work, we introduce JL-GAT, an application of GAT to MARL-based TSC that balances scalability with enhanced grounding capability by incorporating information from neighboring agents. JL-GAT adopts a decentralized approach to GAT, allowing for the scalability often required in real-world traffic networks while still capturing key interactions between agents. Comprehensive experiments on various road networks under simulated adverse weather conditions, along with ablation studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of JL-GAT. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/JL-GAT/.

Abstract: This paper investigates how to achieve both low-power operations of sensor nodes and accurate state estimation using Kalman filter for internet of things (IoT) monitoring employing wireless sensor networks under radio resource constraint. We consider two policies used by the base station to collect observations from the sensor nodes: (i) an oblivious policy, based on statistics of the observations, and (ii) a decentralized policy, based on autonomous decision of each sensor based on its instantaneous observation. This work introduces a wake-up receiver and wake-up signaling to both policies to improve the energy efficiency of the sensor nodes. The decentralized policy designed with random access prioritizes transmissions of instantaneous observations that are highly likely to contribute to the improvement of state estimation. Our numerical results show that the decentralized policy improves the accuracy of the estimation in comparison to the oblivious policy under the constraint on the radio resource and consumed energy when the correlation between the processes observed by the sensor nodes is low. We also clarify the degree of correlation in which the superiority of two policies changes.

Abstract: Fine-tuning the large language models (LLMs) are prevented by the deficiency of centralized control and the massive computing and communication overhead on the decentralized schemes. While the typical standard federated learning (FL) supports data privacy, the central server requirement creates a single point of attack and vulnerability to poisoning attacks. Generalizing the result in this direction to 70B-parameter models in the heterogeneous, trustless environments has turned out to be a huge, yet unbroken bottleneck. This paper introduces FLock, a decentralized framework for secure and efficient collaborative LLM fine-tuning. Integrating a blockchain-based trust layer with economic incentives, FLock replaces the central aggregator with a secure, auditable protocol for cooperation among untrusted parties. We present the first empirical validation of fine-tuning a 70B LLM in a secure, multi-domain, decentralized setting. Our experiments show the FLock framework defends against backdoor poisoning attacks that compromise standard FL optimizers and fosters synergistic knowledge transfer. The resulting models show a >68% reduction in adversarial attack success rates. The global model also demonstrates superior cross-domain generalization, outperforming models trained in isolation on their own specialized data.

<title>One Step is Enough: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning based on One-Step Policy Optimization for Order Dispatch on Ride-Sharing Platforms</title>

Abstract: On-demand ride-sharing platforms face the fundamental challenge of dynamically bundling passengers with diverse origins and destinations and matching them with vehicles in real time, all under significant uncertainty. Recently, MARL has emerged as a promising solution for this problem, leveraging decentralized learning to address the curse of dimensionality caused by the large number of agents in the ride-hailing market and the resulting expansive state and action spaces. However, conventional MARL-based ride-sharing approaches heavily rely on the accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values, which becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments. Specifically, most of these approaches adopt an independent paradigm, exacerbating this issue, as each agent treats others as part of the environment, leading to unstable training and substantial estimation bias in value functions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel alternative methods that bypass value function estimation. First, we adapt GRPO to ride-sharing, replacing the PPO baseline with the group average reward to eliminate critic estimation errors and reduce training bias. Second, inspired by GRPO's full utilization of group reward information, we customize the PPO framework for ride-sharing platforms and show that, under a homogeneous fleet, the optimal policy can be trained using only one-step rewards - a method we term One-Step Policy Optimization (OSPO). Experiments on a real-world Manhattan ride-hailing dataset demonstrate that both GRPO and OSPO achieve superior performance across most scenarios, efficiently optimizing pickup times and the number of served orders using simple MLP networks.

Abstract: Smart contracts are trustworthy, immutable, and automatically executed programs on the blockchain. Their execution requires the Gas mechanism to ensure efficiency and fairness. However, due to non-optimal coding practices, many contracts contain Gas waste patterns that need to be optimized. Existing solutions mostly rely on manual discovery, which is inefficient, costly to maintain, and difficult to scale. Recent research uses large language models (LLMs) to explore new Gas waste patterns. However, it struggles to remain compatible with existing patterns, often produces redundant patterns, and requires manual validation/rewriting. To address this gap, we present GasAgent, the first multi-agent system for smart contract Gas optimization that combines compatibility with existing patterns and automated discovery/validation of new patterns, enabling end-to-end optimization. GasAgent consists of four specialized agents, Seeker, Innovator, Executor, and Manager, that collaborate in a closed loop to identify, validate, and apply Gas-saving improvements. Experiments on 100 verified real-world contracts demonstrate that GasAgent successfully optimizes 82 contracts, achieving an average deployment Gas savings of 9.97%. In addition, our evaluation confirms its compatibility with existing tools and validates the effectiveness of each module through ablation studies. To assess broader usability, we further evaluate 500 contracts generated by five representative LLMs across 10 categories and find that GasAgent optimizes 79.8% of them, with deployment Gas savings ranging from 4.79% to 13.93%, showing its usability as the optimization layer for LLM-assisted smart contract development.

Abstract: We present the LLM Economist, a novel framework that uses agent-based modeling to design and assess economic policies in strategic environments with hierarchical decision-making. At the lower level, bounded rational worker agents -- instantiated as persona-conditioned prompts sampled from U.S. Census-calibrated income and demographic statistics -- choose labor supply to maximize text-based utility functions learned in-context. At the upper level, a planner agent employs in-context reinforcement learning to propose piecewise-linear marginal tax schedules anchored to the current U.S. federal brackets. This construction endows economic simulacra with three capabilities requisite for credible fiscal experimentation: (i) optimization of heterogeneous utilities, (ii) principled generation of large, demographically realistic agent populations, and (iii) mechanism design -- the ultimate nudging problem -- expressed entirely in natural language. Experiments with populations of up to one hundred interacting agents show that the planner converges near Stackelberg equilibria that improve aggregate social welfare relative to Saez solutions, while a periodic, persona-level voting procedure furthers these gains under decentralized governance. These results demonstrate that large language model-based agents can jointly model, simulate, and govern complex economic systems, providing a tractable test bed for policy evaluation at the societal scale to help build better civilizations.

Abstract: Low-latency localization is critical in cellular networks to support real-time applications requiring precise positioning. In this paper, we propose a distributed machine learning (ML) framework for fingerprint-based localization tailored to cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, an emerging architecture for 6G networks. The proposed framework enables each access point (AP) to independently train a Gaussian process regression model using local angle-of-arrival and received signal strength fingerprints. These models provide probabilistic position estimates for the user equipment (UE), which are then fused by the UE with minimal computational overhead to derive a final location estimate. This decentralized approach eliminates the need for fronthaul communication between the APs and the central processing unit (CPU), thereby reducing latency. Additionally, distributing computational tasks across the APs alleviates the processing burden on the CPU compared to traditional centralized localization schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed distributed framework achieves localization accuracy comparable to centralized methods, despite lacking the benefits of centralized data aggregation. Moreover, it effectively reduces uncertainty of the location estimates, as evidenced by the 95\% covariance ellipse. The results highlight the potential of distributed ML for enabling low-latency, high-accuracy localization in future 6G networks.

Abstract: Tokenized U.S. Treasuries have emerged as a prominent subclass of real-world assets (RWAs), offering cryptographically enforced, yield-bearing instruments collateralized by sovereign debt and deployed across multiple blockchain networks. While the market has expanded rapidly, empirical analyses of transaction-level behaviour remain limited. This paper conducts a quantitative, function-level dissection of U.S. Treasury-backed RWA tokens including BUIDL, BENJI, and USDY, across multi-chain: mostly Ethereum and Layer-2s. We analyze decoded contract calls to isolate core functional primitives such as issuance, redemption, transfer, and bridge activity, revealing segmentation in behaviour between institutional actors and retail users. To model address-level economic roles, we introduce a curvature-aware representation learning framework using Poincar\'e embeddings and liquidity-based graph features. Our method outperforms baseline models on our RWA Treasury dataset in role inference and generalizes to downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and wallet classification in broader blockchain transaction networks. These findings provide a structured understanding of functional heterogeneity and participant roles in tokenized Treasury in a transaction-level perspective, contributing new empirical evidence to the study of on-chain financialization.

Abstract: With rapid advancements in quantum computing, it is widely believed that there will be quantum hardware capable of compromising classical cryptography and hence, the internet and the current information security infrastructure in the coming decade. This is mainly due to the operational realizations of quantum algorithms such as Grover and Shor, to which the current classical encryption protocols are vulnerable. Blockchains, i.e., blockchain data structures and their data, rely heavily on classical cryptography. One approach to secure blockchain is to attempt to achieve information theoretical security by defining blockchain on quantum technologies. There have been two conceptualizations of blockchains on quantum registers: the time-entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state blockchain and the quantum hypergraph blockchain. On our part, an attempt is made to conceptualize a new quantum blockchain combining features of both these schemes to achieve the absolute security of the time-temporal GHZ blockchain and the scalability and efficiency of the quantum hypergraph blockchain in the proposed quantum blockchain protocol.

Abstract: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have emerged as a novel governance mechanism in blockchain ecosystems, particularly within Decentralized Finance (DeFi). By enabling token holders to propose and vote on protocol changes, these systems promise transparent and equitable decision-making without centralized control. In this paper, we present an in-depth empirical study of the governance protocols of Compound and Uniswap, two of the most widely used DAOs in DeFi. Analyzing over 370 governance proposals and millions of on-chain events from their inception until August 2024, we uncover significant centralization of voting power: as few as 3--5 voters were sufficient to sway the majority of proposals. We also find that the cost of voting disproportionately burdens smaller token holders, and that strategic voting behaviors, such as delayed participation and coalition formation, further distort governance outcomes. Our findings suggest that despite their decentralized ideals, current DAO governance mechanisms fall short in practice.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm, which enables multiple and decentralized clients to collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central aggregator. FL can be a scalable machine learning solution in big data scenarios. Traditional FL relies on the trust assumption of the central aggregator, which forms cohorts of clients honestly. However, a malicious aggregator, in reality, could abandon and replace the client's training models, or insert fake clients, to manipulate the final training results. In this work, we introduce zkFL, which leverages zero-knowledge proofs to tackle the issue of a malicious aggregator during the training model aggregation process. To guarantee the correct aggregation results, the aggregator provides a proof per round, demonstrating to the clients that the aggregator executes the intended behavior faithfully. To further reduce the verification cost of clients, we use blockchain to handle the proof in a zero-knowledge way, where miners (i.e., the participants validating and maintaining the blockchain data) can verify the proof without knowing the clients' local and aggregated models. The theoretical analysis and empirical results show that zkFL achieves better security and privacy than traditional FL, without modifying the underlying FL network structure or heavily compromising the training speed.

Abstract: Airdrops are a popular mechanism used by blockchain protocols to bootstrap communities, reward early adopters, and decentralize token distribution. Despite their widespread adoption, the effectiveness of airdrops in achieving long-term user engagement and ecosystem growth remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of nine major airdrops across Ethereum and Layer-2 ecosystems. Our analysis reveals that a substantial share of tokens--up to 66% in some cases--are rapidly sold, often in recipients' first post-claim transaction. We show that this behavior is largely driven by "airdrop farmers," who strategically optimize eligibility criteria to extract value without contributing meaningfully to the ecosystem. We complement our quantitative findings with a case study of the Arbitrum airdrop, illustrating how short-term activity spikes fail to translate into sustained user involvement. Based on these results, we discuss common design pitfalls--such as Sybil vulnerability, poor incentive alignment, and governance token misuse--and propose actionable guidelines for designing more effective airdrop strategies.

<title>ACFIX: Guiding LLMs with Mined Common RBAC Practices for Context-Aware Repair of Access Control Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06838</link>

Abstract: Smart contracts are susceptible to various security issues, among which access control (AC) vulnerabilities are particularly critical. While existing research has proposed multiple detection tools, the automatic and appropriate repair of AC vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a challenge. Unlike commonly supported vulnerability types by existing repair tools, such as reentrancy, which are usually fixed by template-based approaches, the main obstacle of AC lies in identifying the appropriate roles or permissions amid a long list of non-AC-related source code to generate proper patch code, a task that demands human-level intelligence.
  Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFIX. The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality. To this end, ACFIX involves both offline and online phases. First, during the offline phase, ACFIX mines a taxonomy of common Role-based Access Control (RBAC) practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 pairs mined. Second, during the online phase, ACFIX tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch. This patch will then undergo a validity and effectiveness check. To evaluate ACFIX, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFIX successfully repaired 94.92% of them. This represents a significant improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4, which achieved only 52.54%.

Abstract: Platooning represents an advanced driving technology designed to assist drivers in traffic convoys of varying lengths, enhancing road safety, reducing driver fatigue, and improving fuel efficiency. Sophisticated automated driving assistance systems have facilitated this innovation. Recent advancements in platooning emphasize cooperative mechanisms within both centralized and decentralized architectures enabled by vehicular communication technologies. This study introduces a cooperative route planning optimization framework aimed at promoting the adoption of platooning through a centralized platoon formation strategy at the system level. This approach is envisioned as a transitional phase from individual (ego) driving to fully collaborative driving. Additionally, this research formulates and incorporates travel cost metrics related to fuel consumption, driver fatigue, and travel time, considering regulatory constraints on consecutive driving durations. The performance of these cost metrics has been evaluated using Dijkstra's and A* shortest path algorithms within a network graph framework. The results indicate that the proposed architecture achieves an average cost improvement of 14 % compared to individual route planning for long road trips.

Abstract: Conspiracy theories have long drawn public attention, but their explosive growth on platforms like Telegram during the COVID-19 pandemic raises pressing questions about their impact on societal trust, democracy, and public health. We provide a geographical, temporal and network analysis of the structure of of conspiracy-related German-language Telegram chats in a novel large-scale data set. We examine how information flows between regional user groups and influential broadcasting channels, revealing the interplay between decentralized discussions and content spread driven by a small number of key actors.
  Our findings reveal that conspiracy-related activity spikes during major COVID-19-related events, correlating with societal stressors and mirroring prior research on how crises amplify conspiratorial beliefs. By analysing the interplay between regional, national and transnational chats, we uncover how information flows from larger national or transnational discourse to localised, community-driven discussions. Furthermore, we find that the top 10% of chats account for 94% of all forwarded content, portraying the large influence of a few actors in disseminating information. However, these chats operate independently, with minimal interconnection between each other, primarily forwarding messages to low-traffic groups. Notably, 43% of links shared in the data set point to untrustworthy sources as identified by NewsGuard, a proportion far exceeding their share on other platforms and in other discourse contexts, underscoring the role of conspiracy-related discussions on Telegram as vector for the spread of misinformation.

Abstract: International coordination faces significant friction due to reliance on periodic summits, bilateral consultations, and fragmented communication channels that impede rapid collective responses to emerging global challenges while limiting transparency to constituents. We present the Stated Protocol, a decentralized framework that enables organizations to coordinate through standardized text statements published on their website domains. While applicable to all organizations, this work focuses primarily on the application in international relations, where the protocol enables rapid consensus discovery and collective decision-making without relying on centralized social media platforms. We explore specific applications: (1) faster treaty negotiation through incremental micro-agreements that can be signed digitally within hours rather than months, (2) continuous and transparent operation of international institutions through asynchronous decision-making, (3) coordinated signaling from local governments to national authorities through simultaneous statement publication, and (4) coalition formation among non-governmental organizations through transparent position aggregation.

<title>Demystifying Feature Requests: Leveraging LLMs to Refine Feature Requests in Open-Source Software</title>

Abstract: The growing popularity and widespread use of software applications (apps) across various domains have driven rapid industry growth. Along with this growth, fast-paced market changes have led to constantly evolving software requirements. Such requirements are often grounded in feature requests and enhancement suggestions, typically provided by users in natural language (NL). However, these requests often suffer from defects such as ambiguity and incompleteness, making them challenging to interpret. Traditional validation methods (e.g., interviews and workshops) help clarify such defects but are impractical in decentralized environments like open-source software (OSS), where change requests originate from diverse users on platforms like GitHub. This paper proposes a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect and refine NL defects in feature requests. Our approach automates the identification of ambiguous and incomplete requests and generates clarification questions (CQs) to enhance their usefulness for developers. To evaluate its effectiveness, we apply our method to real-world OSS feature requests and compare its performance against human annotations. In addition, we conduct interviews with GitHub developers to gain deeper insights into their perceptions of NL defects, the strategies they use to address these defects, and the impact of defects on downstream software engineering (SE) tasks.

Abstract: Real-time trajectory planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments remains a key challenge due to high computational demands and the need for fast, adaptive responses. Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with premature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory planner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve swarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to dynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using B-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization complexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent framework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with distributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation. The distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized control, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across several metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and applicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex environmental conditions.

Abstract: Quantum computing poses fundamental risks to classical blockchain systems by undermining widely used cryptographic primitives. In response, two major research directions have emerged: post-quantum blockchains, which integrate quantum-resistant algorithms, and quantum blockchains, which leverage quantum properties such as entanglement and quantum key distribution. This survey reviews key developments in both areas, analyzing their cryptographic foundations, architectural designs, and implementation challenges. This work provides a comparative overview of technical proposals, highlight trade-offs in security, scalability, and deployment, and identify open research problems across hardware, consensus, and network design. The goal is to offer a structured and comprehensive reference for advancing secure blockchain systems in the quantum era.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel class of multi-stage resource allocation games that model real-world scenarios in which profitability depends on the balance between supply and demand, and where higher resource investment leads to greater returns. Our proposed framework, which incorporates the notion of profit loss due to insufficient player participation, gives rise to a Tullock-like functional form of the stage payoff structure when weighted fair proportional resource allocation is applied. We explore both centralized and Nash equilibrium strategies, establish sufficient conditions for their existence and uniqueness, and provide an iterative, semi-decentralized method to compute the Nash equilibrium in games with arbitrarily many players. Additionally, we demonstrate that the framework generalizes instances of several existing models, including Receding Horizon and Blotto games, and present a semi-analytical method for computing the unique Nash equilibrium within the Blotto setup. Our findings are validated through a numerical case study in smart mobility, highlighting the practical relevance and applicability of the proposed model.

Abstract: The rise of blockchain and Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) has gained wide traction. Instead of relying on a traditional centralized data authority, a blockchain system consists of digitally entangled block data shared across a distributed network. The specially designed chain data structure and its consensus mechanism protect blockchain data from being tampered by unauthorized adversaries. However, implementing a full-fledged blockchain system to protect a database can be technically cumbersome. In this work, we introduce an in-database design, named chain table, to protect data integrity without the need for a blockchain system. It features a succinct design without significant technology barriers or storage overhead. To realize rigorous data security, we also propose a set of data writing principles for the chain table. We prove that the chain table, together with the data writing principles, will guarantee flexible data integrity, named table-level data integrity (TDI).

Abstract: Safe Multi-Agent Motion Planning (MAMP) is a significant challenge in robotics. Despite substantial advancements, existing methods often face a dilemma. Decentralized algorithms typically rely on predicting the behavior of other agents, sharing contracts, or maintaining communication for safety, while centralized approaches struggle with scalability and real-time decision-making. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Learning (HJR) for Decentralized Multi-Agent Motion Planning. Our method provides scalable neural HJR modeling to tackle high-dimensional configuration spaces and capture worst-case collision and safety constraints between agents. We further propose a decentralized trajectory optimization framework that incorporates the learned HJR solutions to solve MAMP tasks in real-time. We demonstrate that our method is both scalable and data-efficient, enabling the solution of MAMP problems in higher-dimensional scenarios with complex collision constraints. Our approach generalizes across various dynamical systems, including a 12-dimensional dual-arm setup, and outperforms a range of state-of-the-art techniques in successfully addressing challenging MAMP tasks.

Abstract: The rapid integration of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and Web3 technologies into digital banks and fintech operations has created an integrated environment blending traditional financial systems with decentralised elements. This paper introduces the CryptoNeo Threat Modelling Framework (CNTMF), a proposed framework designed to address the risks in these ecosystems, such as oracle manipulation and cross-chain exploits. CNTMF represents a proposed extension of established methodologies like STRIDE, OWASP Top 10, NIST frameworks, LINDDUN, and PASTA, while incorporating tailored components including Hybrid Layer Analysis, the CRYPTOQ mnemonic for cryptocurrency-specific risks, and an AI-Augmented Feedback Loop. Drawing on real-world data from 2025 incidents, CNTMF supports data-driven mitigation to reduce losses, which totalled approximately $2.47 billion in the first half of 2025 across 344 security events (CertiK via GlobeNewswire, 2025; Infosecurity Magazine, 2025). Its phases guide asset mapping, risk profiling, prioritisation, mitigation, and iterative feedback. This supports security against evolving risks like state-sponsored attacks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.14080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring liveness in a decentralized system, such as PBFT, is critical, because there may not be any single administrator that can restart the system if it encounters a liveness bug. At the same time, liveness is challenging to achieve because any single participant could be malicious, and yet the overall system must make forward progress. While verification is a promising approach for ensuring the absence of bugs, no prior work has been able to verify liveness for an executable implementation of PBFT.
  Shipwright is a verification framework for proving correctness and liveness of distributed systems where some participants might be malicious. Shipwright introduces three techniques that enable formal reasoning about decentralized settings with malicious participants, allow developers to decompose their system and proof in a modular fashion into sub-protocols and sub-proofs, and support sound reasoning about cryptographic signatures that may be embedded in messages. We used Shipwright to implement and verify an initial prototype of agreement on a single log entry in PBFT (with a few limitations) and translate it to an executable implementation in Go. We experimentally demonstrate its operation and liveness both in the common case and in several failure scenarios.

<title>On the Consideration of Vanity Address Generation via Identity-Based Signatures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.12670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An address is indicated as an identifier of the user on the blockchain, and is defined by a hash value of the ECDSA verification key. A vanity address is an address that embeds custom characters such as a name. To generate a vanity address, a classical try-and-error method is employed, and thus the number of characters to be embedded is limited. In this paper, we focus on the functionality of identity-based signatures (IBS) where any strings can be employed as a verification key, and explore whether IBS can be used for generating a vanity address. We attach importance to the fact that it is not realistic to replace ECDSA with key recovery, which is currently employed for issuing transactions in Ethereum, to an IBS scheme. Even if this replacement is possible, it is not a reasonable price for the ease of the vanity address generation. Thus, we pay attention to a generic construction of IBS from signatures, and construct an IBS scheme from ECDSA with key recovery. Though we cannot directly generate a vanity address due to the key recovery functionality of the underlying ECDSA, we can connect any string with an address due to the functionality of IBS that can give additional meaning to the address. We implement our system by Solidity, and demonstrate that the gas cost is almost same as that of the ECDSA signature verification.

<title>A Distributed Generative AI Approach for Heterogeneous Multi-Domain Environments under Data Sharing constraints</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained increasing attention for its ability to enable multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing their raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However, training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings. Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive empirical analysis of the economics and dynamics behind arbitrages between centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEX-DEX) on Ethereum. We refine heuristics to identify arbitrage transactions from on-chain data and introduce a robust empirical framework to estimate arbitrage revenue without knowing traders' actual behaviors on CEX. Leveraging an extensive dataset spanning 19 months from August 2023 to March 2025, we estimate a total of 233.8M USD extracted by 19 major CEX-DEX searchers from 7,203,560 identified CEX-DEX arbitrages. Our analysis reveals increasing centralization trends as three searchers captured three-quarters of both volume and extracted value. We also demonstrate that searchers' profitability is tied to their integration level with block builders and uncover exclusive searcher-builder relationships and their market impact. Finally, we correct the previously underestimated profitability of block builders who vertically integrate with a searcher. These insights illuminate the darkest corner of the MEV landscape and highlight the critical implications of CEX-DEX arbitrages for Ethereum's decentralization.

Abstract: Virtual dynamic environments (VDEs) such as the Metaverse and digital twins (DTs) require proper representation of the interacting entities to map their characteristics within the simulated or augmented space. Keeping these representations accurate and up-to-date is crucial for seamless interaction and system reliability. In this paper, we propose bidirectional age of incorrect information (BAoII) to address this aspect. BAoII quantifies the time-dependent penalty paid by an entity in a VDE due to incorrect or outdated knowledge about itself and the overall dynamically changing space. This extends the concept of age of incorrect information for a bidirectional information exchange, capturing that a VDE requires mutual awareness of the entity's own representation, measured in the virtual space, and what the other entities share about their representations. Using a continuous-time Markov chain model, we derive a closed-form expression for long-term BAoII and identify a transmission cost threshold for optimal update strategies. We describe a trade-off between communication cost and information freshness and validate our model through numerical simulations, demonstrating the impact of BAoII on evaluating system performance and highlighting its relevance for real-time collaboration in the Metaverse and DTs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a dataset and experimental study for decentralized federated learning (DFL) applied to IoT crowdsensing malware detection. The dataset comprises behavioral records from benign and eight malware families. A total of 21,582,484 original records were collected from system calls, file system activities, resource usage, kernel events, input/output events, and network records. These records were aggregated into 30-second windows, resulting in 342,106 features used for model training and evaluation. Experiments on the DFL platform compare traditional machine learning (ML), centralized federated learning (CFL), and DFL across different node counts, topologies, and data distributions. Results show that DFL maintains competitive performance while preserving data locality, outperforming CFL in most settings. This dataset provides a solid foundation for studying the security of IoT crowdsensing environments.

However, quantum noise remains a significant barrier in QFL, since modern quantum devices experience heterogeneous noise levels due to variances in hardware quality and sensitivity to quantum decoherence, resulting in inadequate training performance. To address this issue, we propose SpoQFL, a novel QFL framework that leverages sporadic learning to mitigate quantum noise heterogeneity in distributed quantum systems. SpoQFL dynamically adjusts training strategies based on noise fluctuations, enhancing model robustness, convergence stability, and overall learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that SpoQFL significantly outperforms conventional QFL approaches, achieving superior training performance and more stable convergence.

Abstract: In this paper, we informally introduce the Pulsar proof of stake consensus paper and discuss the relevant design decisions and considerations. The Pulsar protocol we propose is designed to facilitate the creation of a proof of stake sidechain for a proof of work blockchain. We present an overview of a novel composable density-based chain selection rule for proof of stake systems which can be seen as a superset of some standard existing longest chain rules for proof of stake protocols. We discuss the Pulsar protocol in comparison to existing proof of stake protocols and define its benefits over existing designs while defining the limitations of the work. Pulsar is currently implemented in the Mintlayer proof of stake Bitcoin sidechain.

Abstract: We propose a decentralized, learning-based framework for dynamic coalition formation in Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA). Our approach extends MAPPO by integrating spatial action maps, robot motion planning, intention sharing, and task allocation revision to enable effective and adaptive coalition formation. Extensive simulation studies confirm the effectiveness of our model, enabling each robot to rely solely on local information to learn timely revisions of task selections and form coalitions with other robots to complete collaborative tasks. The results also highlight the proposed framework's ability to handle large robot populations and adapt to scenarios with diverse task sets.

Abstract: The very DNA of AI architecture presents conflicting paths: centralized cloud-based models (Software-as-a-Service) versus decentralized edge AI (local processing on consumer devices). This paper analyzes the competitive battleground across computational capability, energy efficiency, and data privacy. Recent breakthroughs show edge AI challenging cloud systems on performance, leveraging innovations like test-time training and mixture-of-experts architectures. Crucially, edge AI boasts a 10,000x efficiency advantage: modern ARM processors consume merely 100 microwatts forinference versus 1 watt for equivalent cloud processing. Beyond efficiency, edge AI secures data sovereignty by keeping processing local, dismantling single points of failure in centralized architectures. This democratizes access throughaffordable hardware, enables offline functionality, and reduces environmental impact by eliminating data transmission costs. The edge AI market projects explosive growth from $9 billion in 2025 to $49.6 billion by 2030 (38.5% CAGR), fueled by privacy demands and real-time analytics. Critical applications including personalized education, healthcare monitoring, autonomous transport, and smart infrastructure rely on edge AI's ultra-low latency (5-10ms versus 100-500ms for cloud). The convergence of architectural innovation with fundamental physics confirms edge AI's distributed approach aligns with efficient information processing, signaling the inevitable emergence of hybrid edge-cloud ecosystems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training on decentralized data without exposing raw data. However, the evaluation phase in FL may leak sensitive information through shared performance metrics. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol that incorporates Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to enable privacy-preserving and verifiable evaluation for FL. Instead of revealing raw loss values, clients generate a succinct proof asserting that their local loss is below a predefined threshold. Our approach is implemented without reliance on external APIs, using self-contained modules for federated learning simulation, ZKP circuit design, and experimental evaluation on both the MNIST and Human Activity Recognition (HAR) datasets. We focus on a threshold-based proof for a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model (for MNIST) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model (for HAR), and evaluate the approach in terms of computational overhead, communication cost, and verifiability.

Abstract: Sanctioning blockchain addresses has become a common regulatory response to malicious activities. However, enforcement on permissionless blockchains remains challenging due to complex transaction flows and sophisticated fund-obfuscation techniques. Using cryptocurrency mixing tool Tornado Cash as a case study, we quantitatively assess the effectiveness of U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions over a 957-day period, covering 6.79 million Ethereum blocks and 1.07 billion transactions. Our analysis reveals that while OFAC sanctions reduced overall Tornado Cash deposit volume by 71.03% to approximately 2 billion USD, attackers still relied on Tornado Cash in 78.33% of Ethereum-related security incidents, underscoring persistent evasion strategies.
  We identify three structural limitations in current sanction enforcement practices: (i) the susceptibility of binary sanction classifications to dusting attacks; (ii) fragmented censorship by blockchain producers; and (iii) the complexity of obfuscation services exploited by users. To address these gaps, we introduce a more practical algorithm for scoring and tracking, grounded in quantitative impurity. On average, our algorithm processes Ethereum blocks within 0.07 $\pm$ 0.03 seconds and achieves 97.61% precision and 74.08% recall when evaluated on the Bybit exploit. Our findings contribute to ongoing discussions around regulatory effectiveness in Decentralized Finance by providing empirical evidence, clarifying enforcement challenges, and informing future compliance strategies in response to sanctions and blockchain-based security risks.

Abstract: Collective human activities like using an Ouija board (or Kokkuri-san) often produce emergent, coherent linguistic outputs unintended by any single participant. While psychological explanations such as the ideomotor effect exist, a computational understanding of how decentralized, implicit linguistic knowledge fuses through shared physical interaction remains elusive. We introduce CoCre-Sam (Collective-Creature Sampling), a framework modeling this phenomenon as collective Langevin dynamics sampling from implicitly fused language models. Each participant is represented as an agent associated with an energy landscape derived from an internal language model reflecting linguistic priors, and agents exert stochastic forces based on local energy gradients. We theoretically prove that the collective motion of the shared pointer (planchette) corresponds to Langevin MCMC sampling from the sum of individual energy landscapes, representing fused collective knowledge. Simulations validate that CoCre-Sam dynamics effectively fuse different models and generate meaningful character sequences, while ablation studies confirm the essential roles of collective interaction and stochasticity. Altogether, CoCre-Sam provides a novel computational mechanism linking individual implicit knowledge, embodied collective action, and emergent linguistic phenomena, grounding these complex interactions in the principles of probabilistic sampling.

<title>LLAMA: Multi-Feedback Smart Contract Fuzzing Framework with LLM-Guided Seed Generation</title>

Abstract: Smart contracts play a pivotal role in blockchain ecosystems, and fuzzing remains an important approach to securing smart contracts. Even though mutation scheduling is a key factor influencing fuzzing effectiveness, existing fuzzers have primarily explored seed scheduling and generation, while mutation scheduling has been rarely addressed by prior work. In this work, we propose a Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Multi-feedback Smart Contract Fuzzing framework (LLAMA) that integrates LLMs, evolutionary mutation strategies, and hybrid testing techniques. Key components of the proposed LLAMA include: (i) a hierarchical prompting strategy that guides LLMs to generate semantically valid initial seeds, coupled with a lightweight pre-fuzzing phase to select high-potential inputs; (ii) a multi-feedback optimization mechanism that simultaneously improves seed generation, seed selection, and mutation scheduling by leveraging runtime coverage and dependency feedback; and (iii) an evolutionary fuzzing engine that dynamically adjusts mutation operator probabilities based on effectiveness, while incorporating symbolic execution to escape stagnation and uncover deeper vulnerabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that LLAMA outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in both coverage and vulnerability detection. Specifically, it achieves 91% instruction coverage and 90% branch coverage, while detecting 132 out of 148 known vulnerabilities across diverse categories. These results highlight LLAMA's effectiveness, adaptability, and practicality in real-world smart contract security testing scenarios.

<title>Fast and Scalable Game-Theoretic Trajectory Planning with Intentional Uncertainties</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.12174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory planning involving multi-agent interactions has been a long-standing challenge in the field of robotics, primarily burdened by the inherent yet intricate interactions among agents. While game-theoretic methods are widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent interactions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating the intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional uncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing game-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive trajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties of agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability. As the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under intentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its agent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain minor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive trajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium can be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we present a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the problem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant outcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of intentional uncertainties. Its scalability surpasses that of existing centralized and decentralized baselines, allowing for real-time interactive trajectory planning in uncertain game settings.

<title>A Bayesian Incentive Mechanism for Poison-Resilient Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, its open-participation nature exposes it to data-poisoning attacks, in which malicious actors submit corrupted model updates to degrade the global model. Existing defenses are often reactive, relying on statistical aggregation rules that can be computationally expensive and that typically assume an honest majority. This paper introduces a proactive, economic defense: a lightweight Bayesian incentive mechanism that makes malicious behavior economically irrational. Each training round is modeled as a Bayesian game of incomplete information in which the server, acting as the principal, uses a small, private validation dataset to verify update quality before issuing payments. The design satisfies Individual Rationality (IR) for benevolent clients, ensuring their participation is profitable, and Incentive Compatibility (IC), making poisoning an economically dominated strategy. Extensive experiments on non-IID partitions of MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrate robustness: with 50% label-flipping adversaries on MNIST, the mechanism maintains 96.7% accuracy, only 0.3 percentage points lower than in a scenario with 30% label-flipping adversaries. This outcome is 51.7 percentage points better than standard FedAvg, which collapses under the same 50% attack. The mechanism is computationally light, budget-bounded, and readily integrates into existing FL frameworks, offering a practical route to economically robust and sustainable FL ecosystems.

<title>On One-Shot Signatures, Quantum vs Classical Binding, and Obfuscating Permutations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12456</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.12456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-shot signatures (OSS) were defined by Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, and Zhandry (STOC'20). These allow for signing exactly one message, after which the signing key self-destructs, preventing a second message from ever being signed. While such an object is impossible classically, Amos et al observe that OSS may be possible using quantum signing keys by leveraging the no-cloning principle. OSS has since become an important conceptual tool with many applications in decentralized settings and for quantum cryptography with classical communication. OSS are also closely related to separations between classical-binding and collapse-binding for post-quantum hashing and commitments. Unfortunately, the only known OSS construction due to Amos et al. was only justified in a classical oracle model, and moreover their justification was ultimately found to contain a fatal bug. Thus, the existence of OSS, even in a classical idealized model, has remained open.
  We give the first standard-model OSS, with provable security assuming (sub-exponential) indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and LWE. This also gives the first standard-model separation between classical and collapse-binding post-quantum commitments/hashing, solving a decade-old open problem. Along the way, we also give the first construction with unconditional security relative to a classical oracle. To achieve our standard-model construction, we develop a notion of permutable pseudorandom permutations (permutable PRPs), and show how they are useful for translating oracle proofs involving random permutations into obfuscation-based proofs. In particular, obfuscating permutable PRPs gives a trapdoor one-way permutation that is \emph{full-domain}, solving another decade-old-problem of constructing this object from (sub-exponential) iO and one-way functions.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents in environments involving human interaction has increasingly raised security concerns. Consequently, understanding the circumstances behind an event becomes critical, requiring the development of capabilities to justify their behaviors to non-expert users. Such explanations are essential in enhancing trustworthiness and safety, acting as a preventive measure against failures, errors, and misunderstandings. Additionally, they contribute to improving communication, bridging the gap between the agent and the user, thereby improving the effectiveness of their interactions. This work presents an accountability and explainability architecture implemented for ROS-based mobile robots. The proposed solution consists of two main components. Firstly, a black box-like element to provide accountability, featuring anti-tampering properties achieved through blockchain technology. Secondly, a component in charge of generating natural language explanations by harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) over the data contained within the previously mentioned black box. The study evaluates the performance of our solution in three different scenarios, each involving autonomous agent navigation functionalities. This evaluation includes a thorough examination of accountability and explainability metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in using accountable data from robot actions to obtain coherent, accurate and understandable explanations, even when facing challenges inherent in the use of autonomous agents in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Blockchain enables novel, trustworthy Process-Aware Information Systems (PAISs) by enforcing the security, robustness, and traceability of operations. In particular, transparency ensures that all information exchanges are openly accessible, fostering trust within the system. Although this is a desirable property to enable notarization and auditing activities, it also represents a limitation for such cases where confidentiality is a requirement since interactions involve sensitive data. Current solutions rely on obfuscation techniques or private infrastructures, hindering the enforcement capabilities of smart contracts and the public verifiability of transactions. Against this background, we propose CONFETTY, an architecture for blockchain-based PAISs to preserve confidentiality and transparency. Smart contracts enact, enforce and store public interactions, while attribute-based encryption techniques are adopted to specify access grants to confidential information. We assess the security of our solution through a systematic threat model analysis and evaluate its practical feasibility by gauging the performance of our implemented prototype in different scenarios from the literature.

<title>Generative Emergent Communication: Large Language Model is a Collective World Model</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to capture extensive world knowledge, yet how this is achieved without direct sensorimotor experience remains a fundamental puzzle. This study proposes a novel theoretical solution by introducing the Collective World Model hypothesis. We argue that an LLM does not learn a world model from scratch; instead, it learns a statistical approximation of a collective world model that is already implicitly encoded in human language through a society-wide process of embodied, interactive sense-making. To formalize this process, we introduce generative emergent communication (Generative EmCom), a framework built on the Collective Predictive Coding (CPC). This framework models the emergence of language as a process of decentralized Bayesian inference over the internal states of multiple agents. We argue that this process effectively creates an encoder-decoder structure at a societal scale: human society collectively encodes its grounded, internal representations into language, and an LLM subsequently decodes these symbols to reconstruct a latent space that mirrors the structure of the original collective representations. This perspective provides a principled, mathematical explanation for how LLMs acquire their capabilities. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) the formalization of the Generative EmCom framework, clarifying its connection to world models and multi-agent reinforcement learning, and 2) its application to interpret LLMs, explaining phenomena such as distributional semantics as a natural consequence of representation reconstruction. This work provides a unified theory that bridges individual cognitive development, collective language evolution, and the foundations of large-scale AI.

Abstract: Traditional social media platforms, once envisioned as digital town squares, now face growing criticism over corporate control, content moderation, and privacy concerns. Events such as Twitter's acquisition (now X) and major policy changes have pushed users toward alternative platforms like Mastodon and Threads. However, this diversification has led to user dispersion and fragmented discussions across the walled gardens of social media platforms. To address these issues, federation protocols like ActivityPub have been adopted, with Mastodon leading efforts to build decentralized yet interconnected networks. In March 2024, Threads joined this federation by introducing its Fediverse Sharing service, which enables interactions such as posts, replies, and likes between Threads and Mastodon users as if on a unified platform. Building on this development, we study the interactions between 20,000+ Threads users and 20,000+ Mastodon users over a ten-month period. Our work lays the foundation for research on cross-platform interactions and federation-driven platform integration.

<title>From Semantic Web and MAS to Agentic AI: A Unified Narrative of the Web of Agents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static, document-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users' behalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become more capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across different communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered frameworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the Semantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation obscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic understanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive evolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and the MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations of earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To systematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery mechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent where others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift in the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic Web) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model (LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable and adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new protocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open, trustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies in solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance for the emerging WoA.

<title>FAFO: Over 1 million TPS on a single node running EVM while still Merkleizing every block</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current blockchain execution throughput is limited by data contention, reducing execution layer parallelism. Fast Ahead-of-Formation Optimization (FAFO) is the first blockchain transaction scheduler to address this problem by reordering transactions before block formation for maximum concurrency. FAFO uses CPU-optimized cache-friendly Bloom filters to efficiently detect conflicts and schedule parallel transaction execution at high throughput and low overhead.
  We integrate the Rust EVM client (REVM) into FAFO and achieve over 1.1 million native ETH transfers per second and over half a million ERC20 transfers per second on a single node (Table 1), with 91% lower cost compared to state-of-the-art sharded execution. Unlike many other existing high throughput blockchain execution clients, FAFO uses QMDB to Merkleize world state after every block, enabling light clients and stateless validation for ZK-based vApps. FAFO scales with minimal synchronization overhead, scaling linearly with additional CPU resources until it fully exploits the maximum parallelism of the underlying transaction flow. FAFO proves that the high throughput necessary to support future decentralized applications can be achieved with a streamlined execution layer and innovations in blockchain transaction scheduler design. FAFO is open-sourced at https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/fafo.

Abstract: Cloud storage introduces critical privacy challenges for encrypted data retrieval, where fuzzy multi-keyword search enables approximate matching while preserving data confidentiality. Existing solutions face fundamental trade-offs between security and efficiency: linear-search mechanisms provide adaptive security but incur prohibitive overhead for large-scale data, while tree-based indexes improve performance at the cost of branch leakage vulnerabilities.
  To address these limitations, we propose DVFS - a dynamic verifiable fuzzy search service with three core innovations: (1) An \textit{adaptive-secure fuzzy search} method integrating locality-sensitive hashing with virtual binary trees, eliminating branch leakage while reducing search complexity from linear to sublinear ($O(\log n)$ time); (2) A \textit{dual-repository version control} mechanism supporting dynamic updates with forward privacy, preventing information leakage during operations; (3) A \textit{blockchain-based verification system} that ensures correctness and completeness via smart contracts, achieving $O(\log n)$ verification complexity.
  Our solution advances secure encrypted retrieval by simultaneously resolving the security-performance paradox and enabling trustworthy dynamic operations.

Abstract: Decentralized trading of real-world alternative assets (e.g., gold) requires bridging physical asset custody with blockchain systems while meeting strict requirements for compliance, liquidity, and risk management. We present GoldMine OS, a research oriented architecture that employs multiple specialized AI agents to automate and secure the tokenization and exchange of physical gold into a blockchain based stablecoin ("OZ"). Our approach combines on chain smart contracts for critical risk controls with off chain AI agents for decision making, blending the transparency and reliability of blockchains with the flexibility of AI driven automation. We describe four cooperative agents (Compliance, Token Issuance, Market Making, and Risk Control) and a coordinating core, and evaluate the system through simulation and a controlled pilot deployment. In experiments the prototype delivers on demand token issuance in under 1.2 s, more than 100 times faster than manual workflows. The Market Making agent maintains tight liquidity with spreads often below 0.5 percent even under volatile conditions. Fault injection tests show resilience: an oracle price spoofing attack is detected and mitigated within 10 s, and a simulated vault mis reporting halts issuance immediately with minimal user impact. The architecture scales to 5000 transactions per second with 10000 concurrent users in benchmarks. These results indicate that an AI agent based decentralized exchange for alternative assets can satisfy rigorous performance and safety requirements. We discuss broader implications for democratizing access to traditionally illiquid assets and explain how our governance model -- multi signature agent updates and on chain community voting on risk parameters -- provides ongoing transparency, adaptability, and formal assurance of system integrity.

Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning approach that enables multiple devices (i.e., agents) to train a shared model cooperatively without exchanging raw data. This technique keeps data localized on user devices, ensuring privacy and security, while each agent trains the model on their own data and only shares model updates. The communication overhead is a significant challenge due to the frequent exchange of model updates between the agents and the central server. In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient federated learning scheme that utilizes low-rank approximation of neural network gradients and quantization to significantly reduce the network load of the decentralized learning process with minimal impact on the model's accuracy.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has undergone significant development since its inception in 2016, advancing from basic algorithms to complex methodologies tailored to address diverse challenges and use cases. However, research and benchmarking of novel FL techniques against a plethora of established state-of-the-art solutions remain challenging. To streamline this process, we introduce FLsim, a comprehensive FL simulation framework designed to meet the diverse requirements of FL workflows in the literature. FLsim is characterized by its modularity, scalability, resource efficiency, and controlled reproducibility of experimental outcomes. Its easy to use interface allows users to specify customized FL requirements through job configuration, which supports: (a) customized data distributions, ranging from non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data to independent and identically distributed (iid) data, (b) selection of local learning algorithms according to user preferences, with complete agnosticism to ML libraries, (c) choice of network topology illustrating communication patterns among nodes, (d) definition of model aggregation and consensus algorithms, and (e) pluggable blockchain support for enhanced robustness. Through a series of experimental evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of FLsim in simulating a diverse range of state-of-the-art FL experiments. We envisage that FLsim would mark a significant advancement in FL simulation frameworks, offering unprecedented flexibility and functionality for researchers and practitioners alike.

<title>Immutability Does Not Guarantee Trust: A Formal and Logical Refutation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08844</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is frequently claimed in blockchain discourse that immutability guarantees trust. This paper rigorously refutes that assertion. We define immutability as the cryptographic persistence of historical states in an append-only data structure and contrast it with trust, understood as a rational epistemic expectation under uncertainty. Employing predicate logic, automata-theoretic models, and epistemic game-theoretic analysis, we demonstrate that immutability neither entails nor implies correctness, fairness, or credibility. Through formal constructions and counterexamples--including predictive fraud schemes and the phenomenon of garbage permanence--we show that the belief conflates structural and epistemic domains. Immutability preserves all data equally, regardless of veracity. Therefore, the assertion that immutability guarantees trust collapses under the weight of formal scrutiny.

Abstract: As archives turn to artificial intelligence to manage growing volumes of digital records, privacy risks inherent in current AI data practices raise critical concerns about data sovereignty and ethical accountability. This paper explores how privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) and Web3 architectures can support archives to preserve control over sensitive content while still being able to make it available for access by researchers. We present Clio-X, a decentralized, privacy-first Web3 digital solution designed to embed PETs into archival workflows and support AI-enabled reference and access. Drawing on a user evaluation of a medium-fidelity prototype, the study reveals both interest in the potential of the solution and significant barriers to adoption related to trust, system opacity, economic concerns, and governance. Using Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation theory, we analyze the sociotechnical dimensions of these barriers and propose a path forward centered on participatory design and decentralized governance through a Clio-X Decentralized Autonomous Organization. By integrating technical safeguards with community-based oversight, Clio-X offers a novel model to ethically deploy AI in cultural heritage contexts.

Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) has introduced a new era of permissionless financial innovation but also led to unprecedented market manipulation. Without centralized oversight, malicious actors coordinate shilling campaigns and pump-and-dump schemes across various platforms. We propose a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for decentralized manipulation detection, modeling the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a dynamic adversarial game. This framework identifies suspicious patterns using delayed token price reactions as financial indicators.Our method introduces three innovations: (1) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance learning stability in sparse-reward and partially observable settings; (2) a theory-based reward function inspired by rational expectations and information asymmetry, differentiating price discovery from manipulation noise; and (3) a multi-modal agent pipeline that integrates LLM-based semantic features, social graph signals, and on-chain market data for informed decision-making.The framework is integrated within the Symphony system, a decentralized multi-agent architecture enabling peer-to-peer agent execution and trust-aware learning through distributed logs, supporting chain-verifiable evaluation. Symphony promotes adversarial co-evolution among strategic actors and maintains robust manipulation detection without centralized oracles, enabling real-time surveillance across global DeFi ecosystems.Trained on 100,000 real-world discourse episodes and validated in adversarial simulations, Hide-and-Shill achieves top performance in detection accuracy and causal attribution. This work bridges multi-agent systems with financial surveillance, advancing a new paradigm for decentralized market intelligence. All resources are available at the Hide-and-Shill GitHub repository to promote open research and reproducibility.

Abstract: Transparency is one of the key benefits of public blockchains. However, the public visibility of transactions potentially compromises users' privacy. The fundamental challenge is to balance the intrinsic benefits of blockchain openness with the vital need for individual confidentiality. The proposal suggests creating a confidential version of wrapped Ethereum (cWETH) fully within the application layer. The solution combines the Elliptic Curve (EC) Twisted ElGamal-based commitment scheme to preserve confidentiality and the EC Diffie-Hellman (DH) protocol to introduce accessibility limited by the commitment scheme. To enforce the correct generation of commitments, encryption, and decryption, zk-SNARKs are utilized.

Abstract: The digitization of democratic processes promises greater accessibility but presents challenges in terms of security, privacy, and verifiability. Existing electronic voting systems often rely on centralized architectures, creating single points of failure and forcing too much trust in authorities, which contradicts democratic principles. This research addresses the challenge of creating a secure, private e-voting system with minimized trust dependencies designed for the most versatile personal device: the smartphone. We introduce SmartphoneDemocracy, a novel e-voting protocol that combines three key technologies: the emerging European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet for Sybil-resistant identity verification, Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy-preserving validation, and a peer-to-peer blockchain (TrustChain) for a resilient, serverless public bulletin board. Our protocol enables voters to register and cast ballots anonymously and verifiably directly from their smartphones. We provide a detailed protocol design, a security analysis against a defined threat model, and a performance evaluation demonstrating that the computational and network overhead is feasible for medium- to large-scale elections. By developing and prototyping this system, we demonstrate a viable path to empower citizens with a trustworthy, accessible, and user-controlled digital voting experience.

Abstract: We present PromptChain, a decentralized Web3 architecture that establishes AI prompts as first-class digital assets with verifiable ownership, version control, and monetization capabilities. Current centralized platforms lack mechanisms for proper attribution, quality assurance, or fair compensation for prompt creators. PromptChain addresses these limitations through a novel integration of IPFS for immutable storage, smart contracts for governance, and token incentives for community curation. Our design includes: (1) a comprehensive metadata schema for cross-model compatibility, (2) a stake-weighted validation mechanism to align incentives, and (3) a token economy that rewards contributors proportionally to their impact. The proposed architecture demonstrates how decentralized systems could potentially match centralized alternatives in efficiency while providing superior ownership guarantees and censorship resistance through blockchain-anchored provenance tracking. By decoupling prompts from specific AI models or outputs, this work establishes the foundation for an open ecosystem of human-AI collaboration in the Web3 era, representing the first systematic treatment of prompts as standalone digital assets with dedicated decentralized infrastructure.

<title>Endorsement-Driven Blockchain SSI Framework for Dynamic IoT Ecosystems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.09859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) offers significant potential for managing identities in the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling decentralized authentication and credential management without reliance on centralized entities. However, existing SSI frameworks often limit credential issuance and revocation to trusted entities, such as IoT manufacturers, which restricts flexibility in dynamic IoT ecosystems. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based SSI framework that allows any individual with a verifiable trust linkage to act as a credential issuer, ensuring decentralized and scalable identity management. Our framework incorporates a layered architecture, where trust is dynamically established through endorsement-based calculations and maintained via a hierarchical chain-of-trust mechanism. Blockchain serves as the Verifiable Data Registry, ensuring transparency and immutability of identity operations, while smart contracts automate critical processes such as credential issuance, verification, and revocation. A proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that the proposed framework is feasible and incurs minimal overheads compared to the baseline, making it well-suited for dynamic and resource-constrained IoT environments.

<title>A New Incentive Model For Content Trust</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.09972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper outlines an incentive-driven and decentralized approach to verifying the veracity of digital content at scale. Widespread misinformation, an explosion in AI-generated content and reduced reliance on traditional news sources demands a new approach for content authenticity and truth-seeking that is fit for a modern, digital world. By using smart contracts and digital identity to incorporate 'trust' into the reward function for published content, not just engagement, we believe that it could be possible to foster a self-propelling paradigm shift to combat misinformation through a community-based governance model. The approach described in this paper requires that content creators stake financial collateral on factual claims for an impartial jury to vet with a financial reward for contribution. We hypothesize that with the right financial and social incentive model users will be motivated to participate in crowdsourced fact-checking and content creators will place more care in their attestations. This is an exploratory paper and there are a number of open issues and questions that warrant further analysis and exploration.

arXiv:2507.10149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mathematically rigorous framework for identifying and completing Coincidence of Wants (CoW) cycles in decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators. Unlike existing auction based systems such as CoWSwap, our approach introduces an asset matrix formulation that not only verifies feasibility using oracle prices and formal conservation laws but also completes partial CoW cycles of swap orders that are discovered using graph traversal and are settled using imbalance correction. We define bridging orders and show that the resulting execution is slippage free and capital preserving for LPs. Applied to real world Arbitrum swap data, our algorithm demonstrates efficient discovery of CoW cycles and supports the insertion of synthetic orders for atomic cycle closure. This work can be thought of as the detailing of a potential delta-neutral strategy by liquidity providing market makers: a structured CoW cycle execution.

Abstract: Federated Learning has emerged as a leading paradigm for decentralized, privacy-preserving learning, particularly relevant in the era of interconnected edge devices equipped with sensors. However, the practical implementation of Federated Learning faces three primary challenges: the need for human involvement in costly data labelling processes for target adaptation, covariate shift in client device data collection due to environmental factors affecting sensors, leading to discrepancies between source and target samples, and the impracticality of continuous or regular model updates in resource-constrained environments due to limited data transmission capabilities and technical constraints on channel availability and energy efficiency. To tackle these issues, we expand upon an efficient and scalable Federated Learning framework tailored for real-world client adaptation in industrial settings. This framework leverages a pre-trained source model comprising a deep backbone, an adaptation module, and a classifier running on a powerful server. By freezing the backbone and classifier during client adaptation on resource-constrained devices, we allow the domain adaptive linear layer to handle target domain adaptation, thus minimizing overall computational overhead. Furthermore, this setup, designated as FedAcross+, is extended to encompass the processing of streaming data, thereby rendering the solution suitable for non-stationary environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedAcross+ in achieving competitive adaptation on low-end client devices with limited target samples, successfully addressing the challenge of domain shift. Moreover, our framework accommodates sporadic model updates within resource-constrained environments, ensuring practical and seamless deployment.

<title>Multi-Robot Cooperative Herding through Backstepping Control Barrier Functions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10249</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel cooperative herding strategy through backstepping control barrier functions (CBFs), which coordinates multiple herders to herd a group of evaders safely towards a designated goal region. For the herding system with heterogeneous groups involving herders and evaders, the behavior of the evaders can only be influenced indirectly by the herders' motion, especially when the evaders follow an inverse dynamics model and respond solely to repulsive interactions from the herders. This indirect interaction mechanism inherently renders the overall system underactuated. To address this issue, we first construct separate CBFs for the dual objectives of goal reaching and collision avoidance, which ensure both herding completion and safety guarantees. Then, we reformulate the underactuated herding dynamics into a control-affine structure and employ a backstepping approach to recursively design control inputs for the hierarchical barrier functions, avoiding taking derivatives of the higher-order system. Finally, we present a cooperative herding strategy based on backstepping CBFs that allow herders to safely herd multiple evaders into the goal region. In addition, centralized and decentralized implementations of the proposed algorithm are developed, further enhancing its flexibility and applicability. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and safety of the proposed strategy in multi-robot herding.

arXiv:2507.10325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without centralizing raw data. However, practical FL deployments often face a key realistic challenge: Clients participate intermittently in server aggregation and with unknown, possibly biased participation probabilities. Most existing convergence results either assume full-device participation, or rely on knowledge of (in fact uniform) client availability distributions -- assumptions that rarely hold in practice. In this work, we characterize the optimization problem that consistently adheres to the stochastic dynamics of the well-known \emph{agnostic Federated Averaging (FedAvg)} algorithm under random (and variably-sized) client availability, and rigorously establish its convergence for convex, possibly nonsmooth losses, achieving a standard rate of order $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ denotes the aggregation horizon. Our analysis provides the first convergence guarantees for agnostic FedAvg under general, non-uniform, stochastic client participation, without knowledge of the participation distribution. We also empirically demonstrate that agnostic FedAvg in fact outperforms common (and suboptimal) weighted aggregation FedAvg variants, even with server-side knowledge of participation weights.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cooperative and decentralized collision avoidance algorithm (CoDe) for small-scale UAV swarms consisting of up to three UAVs. CoDe improves energy efficiency of UAVs by achieving effective cooperation among UAVs. Moreover, CoDe is specifically tailored for UAV's operations by addressing the challenges faced by existing schemes, such as ineffectiveness in selecting actions from continuous action spaces and high computational complexity. CoDe is based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), and finds cooperative policies by incorporating a novel credit assignment scheme. The novel credit assignment scheme estimates the contribution of an individual by subtracting a baseline from the joint action value for the swarm. The credit assignment scheme in CoDe outperforms other benchmarks as the baseline takes into account not only the importance of a UAV's action but also the interrelation between UAVs. Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted against existing MARL-based and conventional heuristic-based algorithms to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Payload transport over flat terrain via multi-wheel robot carriers is well-understood, highly effective, and configurable. In this paper, our goal is to provide similar effectiveness and configurability for transport over rough terrain that is more suitable for legs rather than wheels. For this purpose, we consider multi-biped robot carriers, where wheels are replaced by multiple bipedal robots attached to the carrier. Our main contribution is to design a decentralized controller for such systems that can be effectively applied to varying numbers and configurations of rigidly attached bipedal robots without retraining. We present a reinforcement learning approach for training the controller in simulation that supports transfer to the real world. Our experiments in simulation provide quantitative metrics showing the effectiveness of the approach over a wide variety of simulated transport scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate the controller in the real-world for systems composed of two and three Cassie robots. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a scalable multi-biped payload transport system.

Abstract: Centralized version control systems (VCS) are vital for software development but pose risks of data loss and ownership disputes. While blockchain offers a decentralized alternative, existing solutions are often hindered by high latency, compromising the real-time collaboration essential for modern workflows. This study introduces a novel hybrid architecture combining the security of the Ethereum blockchain and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) with two key contributions: 1) Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) to create a trust-minimized model for key distribution, and 2) an authoritative-first, optimistic-fallback retrieval protocol utilizing a temporary middleware to decouple the user experience from blockchain confirmation delays. We implemented a full prototype and conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation on the public Sepolia testnet. Our results demonstrate that this architecture not only provides a secure, auditable, and resilient platform for source code hosting but also achieves highly competitive user-perceived performance. Our user-perceived push time reduces submission latency by up to 49% compared to a standard git push for common repository sizes, proving that a well-designed decentralized VCS can balance the core tenets of security and decentralization with the practical need for speed and efficiency.

To support this argument, we first examine the unique properties of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts that could lead to these new vectors of harm. Next, we describe each of these new vectors of harm in detail. Finally, we conclude with a call for more technical research aimed at preventing and mitigating these harms and, thereby making it safer to endow AI agents with cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.

Abstract: Open banking framework enables third party providers to access financial data across banking institutions, leading to unprecedented innovations in the financial sector. However, some open banking standards remain susceptible to severe technological risks, including unverified data sources, inconsistent data integrity, and lack of immutability. In this paper, we propose a layered architecture that provides assurance in data trustworthiness with three distinct levels of trust, covering source validation, data-level authentication, and tamper-proof storage. The first layer guarantees the source legitimacy using decentralized identity and verifiable presentation, while the second layer verifies data authenticity and consistency using cryptographic signing. Lastly, the third layer guarantees data immutability through the Tangle, a directed acyclic graph distributed ledger. We implemented a proof-of-concept implementation of our solution to evaluate its performance, where the results demonstrate that the system scales linearly with a stable throughput, exhibits a 100% validation rate, and utilizes under 35% of CPU and 350 MiB memory. Compared to a real-world open banking implementation, our solution offers significantly reduced latency and stronger data integrity assurance. Overall, our solution offers a practical and efficient system for secure data sharing in financial ecosystems while maintaining regulatory compliance.

Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with Internet of Things (IoT) networks offers promising solutions for efficient data collection. However, the limited energy capacity of UAVs remains a significant challenge. In this case, laser beam directors (LBDs) have emerged as an effective technology for wireless charging of UAVs during operation, thereby enabling sustained data collection without frequent returns to charging stations (CSs). In this work, we investigate the age of information (AoI) optimization in LBD-powered UAV-assisted IoT networks, where multiple UAVs collect data from distributed IoTs while being recharged by laser beams. We formulate a joint optimization problem that aims to minimize the peak AoI while determining optimal UAV trajectories and laser charging strategies. This problem is particularly challenging due to its non-convex nature, complex temporal dependencies, and the need to balance data collection efficiency with energy consumption constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-agent proximal policy optimization with temporal memory and multi-agent coordination (MAPPO-TM) framework. Specifically, MAPPO-TM incorporates temporal memory mechanisms to capture the dynamic nature of UAV operations and facilitates effective coordination among multiple UAVs through decentralized learning while considering global system objectives. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MAPPO-TM algorithm outperforms conventional approaches in terms of peak AoI minimization and energy efficiency. Ideally, the proposed algorithm achieves up to 15.1% reduction in peak AoI compared to conventional multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) methods.

<title>FedP3E: Privacy-Preserving Prototype Exchange for Non-IID IoT Malware Detection in Cross-Silo Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: As IoT ecosystems continue to expand across critical sectors, they have become prominent targets for increasingly sophisticated and large-scale malware attacks. The evolving threat landscape, combined with the sensitive nature of IoT-generated data, demands detection frameworks that are both privacy-preserving and resilient to data heterogeneity. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution by enabling decentralized model training without exposing raw data. However, standard FL algorithms such as FedAvg and FedProx often fall short in real-world deployments characterized by class imbalance and non-IID data distributions -- particularly in the presence of rare or disjoint malware classes. To address these challenges, we propose FedP3E (Privacy-Preserving Prototype Exchange), a novel FL framework that supports indirect cross-client representation sharing while maintaining data privacy. Each client constructs class-wise prototypes using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), perturbs them with Gaussian noise, and transmits only these compact summaries to the server. The aggregated prototypes are then distributed back to clients and integrated into local training, supported by SMOTE-based augmentation to enhance representation of minority malware classes. Rather than relying solely on parameter averaging, our prototype-driven mechanism enables clients to enrich their local models with complementary structural patterns observed across the federation -- without exchanging raw data or gradients. This targeted strategy reduces the adverse impact of statistical heterogeneity with minimal communication overhead. We evaluate FedP3E on the N-BaIoT dataset under realistic cross-silo scenarios with varying degrees of data imbalance.

<title>AdeptHEQ-FL: Adaptive Homomorphic Encryption for Federated Learning of Hybrid Classical-Quantum Models with Dynamic Layer Sparing</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency, especially in non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL framework that integrates (i) a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture for expressive decentralized learning, (ii) an adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation scheme leveraging differentially private validation accuracies, (iii) selective homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure aggregation of sensitive model layers, and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx 25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces communication overhead by freezing less important layers, demonstrating the efficiency and practicality of our privacy-preserving, resource-aware design for FL.

<title>PILOC: A Pheromone Inverse Guidance Mechanism and Local-Communication Framework for Dynamic Target Search of Multi-Agent in Unknown Environments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07376</link>

arXiv:2507.07376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Search and Rescue (MASAR) plays a vital role in disaster response, exploration, and reconnaissance. However, dynamic and unknown environments pose significant challenges due to target unpredictability and environmental uncertainty. To tackle these issues, we propose PILOC, a framework that operates without global prior knowledge, leveraging local perception and communication. It introduces a pheromone inverse guidance mechanism to enable efficient coordination and dynamic target localization. PILOC promotes decentralized cooperation through local communication, significantly reducing reliance on global channels. Unlike conventional heuristics, the pheromone mechanism is embedded into the observation space of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), supporting indirect agent coordination based on environmental cues. We further integrate this strategy into a DRL-based multi-agent architecture and conduct extensive experiments. Results show that combining local communication with pheromone-based guidance significantly boosts search efficiency, adaptability, and system robustness. Compared to existing methods, PILOC performs better under dynamic and communication-constrained scenarios, offering promising directions for future MASAR applications.

arXiv:2507.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning (FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator, leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks, HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise grade viability.

<title>The Trust Fabric: Decentralized Interoperability and Economic Coordination for the Agentic Web</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07901</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.07901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fragmentation of AI agent ecosystems has created urgent demands for interoperability, trust, and economic coordination that current protocols -- including MCP (Hou et al., 2025), A2A (Habler et al., 2025), ACP (Liu et al., 2025), and Cisco's AGP (Edwards, 2025) -- cannot address at scale. We present the Nanda Unified Architecture, a decentralized framework built around three core innovations: fast DID-based agent discovery through distributed registries, semantic agent cards with verifiable credentials and composability profiles, and a dynamic trust layer that integrates behavioral attestations with policy compliance. The system introduces X42/H42 micropayments for economic coordination and MAESTRO, a security framework incorporating Synergetics' patented AgentTalk protocol (US Patent 12,244,584 B1) and secure containerization. Real-world deployments demonstrate 99.9 percent compliance in healthcare applications and substantial monthly transaction volumes with strong privacy guarantees. By unifying MIT's trust research with production deployments from Cisco and Synergetics, we show how cryptographic proofs and policy-as-code transform agents into trust-anchored participants in a decentralized economy (Lakshmanan, 2025; Sha, 2025). The result enables a globally interoperable Internet of Agents where trust becomes the native currency of collaboration across both enterprise and Web3 ecosystems.

Abstract: Dataspaces are designed to support sovereign, trusted and decentralized data exchange between participants forming an ecosystem. They are standardized by initiatives such as the International Data Spaces Association or Gaia-X and have gained adoption in several domains such as mobility, manufacturing, tourism or culture. In dataspaces, participants use connectors to communicate peer-to-peer. The Eclipse Dataspace Components (EDC) Connector is a broadly adopted, open-source implementation that adheres to the standards and is supported by a large community. As dataspaces in general, it focuses on the exchange of data assets with associated usage policies and does not support services. In practice, however, there is demand for dataspace-based services and conceptual arguments support their inclusion in dataspaces. In this paper, we propose an abstraction layer for providing generic services within dataspaces. Adopters can use this layer to easily develop own services, seamlessly integrated with the existing dataspace technology. Besides, we present an initial implementation of this service architecture for the EDC Connector and demonstrate its practical applicability.

Abstract: In swarm robotics, decentralized control is often proposed as a more scalable and fault-tolerant alternative to centralized control. However, centralized behaviors are often faster and more efficient than their decentralized counterparts. In any given application, the goals and constraints of the task being solved should guide the choice to use centralized control, decentralized control, or a combination of the two. Currently, the exact trade-offs that exist between centralization and decentralization are not well defined. In this paper, we study comparative performance assessment between centralization and decentralization in the example task of sweep coverage, across five different types of multi-robot control structures: random walk, decentralized with beacons, hybrid formation control using self-organizing hierarchy, centralized formation control, and predetermined. In all five approaches, the coverage task is completed by a group of ground robots. In each approach, except for the random walk, the ground robots are assisted by UAVs, acting as supervisors or beacons. We compare the approaches in terms of three performance metrics for which centralized approaches are expected to have an advantage -- coverage completeness, coverage uniformity, and sweep completion time -- and two metrics for which decentralized approaches are expected to have an advantage -- scalability (4, 8, or 16 ground robots) and fault tolerance (0%, 25%, 50%, or 75% ground robot failure).

Abstract: Federated learning can solve the privacy protection problem in distributed data mining and machine learning, and how to protect the ownership, use and income rights of all parties involved in federated learning is an important issue. This paper proposes a federated learning data ownership confirmation mechanism based on blockchain and smart contract, which uses decentralized blockchain technology to save the contribution of each participant on the blockchain, and distributes the benefits of federated learning results through the blockchain. In the local simulation environment of the blockchain, the relevant smart contracts and data structures are simulated and implemented, and the feasibility of the scheme is preliminarily demonstrated.

Abstract: Wallets are access points for the digital economys value creation. Wallets for blockchains store the end-users cryptographic keys for administrating their digital assets and enable access to blockchain Web3 systems. Web3 delivers new service opportunities. This chapter focuses on the Web3 enabled release of value through the lens of wallets. Wallets may be implemented as software apps on smartphones, web apps on desktops, or hardware devices. Wallet users request high security, ease of use, and access of relevance from their wallets. Increasing connectivity, functionality, autonomy, personal support, and offline capability make the wallet into the user's Universal Access Device for any digital asset. Through wallet based services, the owner obtains enhanced digital empowerment. The new Web3 solutionareas, Identity and Decentralisation, enable considerable societal effects, and wallets are an integral part of these. One example is self sovereign identity solutions combined with wallet borne AI for personalised support, empowering the enduser beyond anything previously known. Improved welfare is foreseen globally through enlarged markets with collaborative services with drastically lowered transaction costs compared to today, the expected vastly increased levels of automation in society necessitate enhanced enduser protection. As wallets are considered a weak spot for security, improving overall security through blockchains is essential.

Abstract: Rugsafe introduces a comprehensive protocol aimed at mitigating the risks of rug pulls in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By utilizing cryptographic security measures and economic incentives, the protocol provides a secure multichain system for recovering assets and transforming rugged tokens into opportunities and rewards. Foundational to Rugsafe are specialized vaults where rugged tokens can be securely deposited, and anticoin tokens are issued as receipts. These anticoins are designed to be inversely pegged to the price movement of the underlying rugged token. Users can utilize these anticoins within the ecosystem or choose to burn them, further securing the protocol and earning additional rewards. The supply of the native Rugsafe token is dynamically adjusted based on the volume, value, and activity of rugged tokens, ensuring stability and resilience. By depositing rugged tokens into a vault on several chains, and by burning anticoins, users receive incentives on the RugSafe chain. This protocol's vaults are designed to work in heterogenous blockchain ecosystems, offering a practical and effective solution to one of the most significant challenges in the cryptocurrency market.

<title>A Single Merging Suffices: Recovering Server-based Learning Performance in Decentralized Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06542</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.06542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized learning provides a scalable alternative to traditional parameter-server-based training, yet its performance is often hindered by limited peer-to-peer communication. In this paper, we study how communication should be scheduled over time, including determining when and how frequently devices synchronize. Our empirical results show that concentrating communication budgets in the later stages of decentralized training markedly improves global generalization. Surprisingly, we uncover that fully connected communication at the final step, implemented by a single global merging, is sufficient to match the performance of server-based training. We further show that low communication in decentralized learning preserves the \textit{mergeability} of local models throughout training. Our theoretical contributions, which explains these phenomena, are first to establish that the globally merged model of decentralized SGD can converge faster than centralized mini-batch SGD. Technically, we novelly reinterpret part of the discrepancy among local models, which were previously considered as detrimental noise, as constructive components that accelerate convergence. This work challenges the common belief that decentralized learning generalizes poorly under data heterogeneity and limited communication, while offering new insights into model merging and neural network loss landscapes.

<title>Coordinated Fast Frequency Regulation in Dynamic Virtual Power Plants via Disturbance Estimation</title>

Abstract: In the context of dynamic virtual power plants (DVPPs), the integration of frequency containment reserve (FCR) and fast frequency control (FFC) enabled via local compensation of power imbalance represents a significant advancement in decentralized frequency regulation. However, they still have to cope with the limited power and energy capacities associated with commonly available storage solutions. This work combines a disturbance estimation based decentralized local control with distributed imbalance compensation in the event of local shortfall. The layered architecture facilitates fast local corrections in power setpoints while enabling coordination between neighbouring DVPP nodes to leverage the aggregated capacity, ensuring scalable and efficient operation suitable for renewable-heavy future grids. The proposed approach is validated on an illustrative 4-bus system with a high percentage of renewables.

<title>FOLC-Net: A Federated-Optimized Lightweight Architecture for Enhanced MRI Disease Diagnosis across Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal Views</title>

Abstract: The framework is designed to improve performance in the analysis of combined as well as single anatomical perspectives for MRI disease diagnosis. It specifically addresses the performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, particularly when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal anatomical planes. The paper introduces the FOLC-Net framework, which incorporates a novel federated-optimized lightweight architecture with approximately 1.217 million parameters and a storage requirement of only 0.9 MB. FOLC-Net integrates Manta-ray foraging optimization (MRFO) mechanisms for efficient model structure generation, global model cloning for scalable training, and ConvNeXt for enhanced client adaptability. The model was evaluated on combined multi-view data as well as individual views, such as axial, coronal, and sagittal, to assess its robustness in various medical imaging scenarios. Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different data to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The results show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the challenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of 92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of study method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally, FOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing a more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized environments. FOLC-Net addresses the limitations of existing SOTA models by providing a framework that ensures better adaptability to individual views while maintaining strong performance in multi-view settings. The incorporation of MRFO, global model cloning, and ConvNeXt ensures that FOLC-Net performs better in real-world medical applications.

Abstract: Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) offer a promising mechanism to protect Australian and Indigenous artists' copyright. They represent and transfer the value of artwork in digital form. Before adopting NFTs to protect Australian artwork, we in this paper investigate them empericially. We focus on examining the details of NFT structure. We start from the underlying structure of NFTs to show how they represent copyright for both artists and production owners, as well as how they aim to safeguard or secure the value of digital artworks. We then involve data collection from various types of sources with different storage methods, including on-chain, centralized, and decentralized systems. Based on both metadata and artwork content, we present our analysis and discussion on the following key issues: copyright, security and artist identification. The final results of the evaluation, unfortnately, show that the NFT is NOT ready to protect Australian and Indigenous artists' copyright.

Abstract: Decentralized learning offers a promising approach to crowdsource data consumptions and computational workloads across geographically distributed compute interconnected through peer-to-peer networks, accommodating the exponentially increasing demands. However, proper incentives are still in absence, considerably discouraging participation. Our vision is that a fair incentive mechanism relies on fair attribution of contributions to participating nodes, which faces non-trivial challenges arising from the localized connections making influence ``cascade'' in a decentralized network. To overcome this, we design the first method to estimate \textbf{D}ata \textbf{I}nfluence \textbf{C}ascad\textbf{E} (DICE) in a decentralized environment. Theoretically, the framework derives tractable approximations of influence cascade over arbitrary neighbor hops, suggesting the influence cascade is determined by an interplay of data, communication topology, and the curvature of loss landscape. DICE also lays the foundations for applications including selecting suitable collaborators and identifying malicious behaviors.

Abstract: We study the problem of online personalized decentralized learning with $N$ statistically heterogeneous clients collaborating to accelerate local training. An important challenge in this setting is to select relevant collaborators to reduce gradient variance while mitigating the introduced bias. To tackle this, we introduce a gradient-based collaboration criterion, allowing each client to dynamically select peers with similar gradients during the optimization process. Our criterion is motivated by a refined and more general theoretical analysis of the All-for-one algorithm, proved to be optimal in Even et al. (2022) for an oracle collaboration scheme. We derive excess loss upper-bounds for smooth objective functions, being either strongly convex, non-convex, or satisfying the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition; our analysis reveals that the algorithm acts as a variance reduction method where the speed-up depends on a sufficient variance. We put forward two collaboration methods instantiating the proposed general schema; and we show that one variant preserves the optimality of All-for-one. We validate our results with experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Our proposed architecture addresses the shortcomings of existing blockchain-based FL solutions by reducing computational and communication overheads while maintaining data privacy and security. We assess the performance of our system through a series of experiments, showcasing its potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning tasks in IoT settings.

Abstract: The Federated Learning paradigm facilitates effective distributed machine learning in settings where training data is decentralized across multiple clients. As the popularity of the strategy grows, increasingly complex real-world problems emerge, many of which require balancing conflicting demands such as fairness, utility, and resource consumption. Recent works have begun to recognise the use of a multi-objective perspective in answer to this challenge. However, this novel approach of combining federated methods with multi-objective optimisation has never been discussed in the broader context of both fields. In this work, we offer a first clear and systematic overview of the different ways the two fields can be integrated. We propose a first taxonomy on the use of multi-objective methods in connection with Federated Learning, providing a targeted survey of the state-of-the-art and proposing unambiguous labels to categorise contributions. Given the developing nature of this field, our taxonomy is designed to provide a solid basis for further research, capturing existing works while anticipating future additions. Finally, we outline open challenges and possible directions for further research.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our asymmetric optimization strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared component is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods. The code is available at https://github.com/sajjad-ucsb/pFedMMA.

Abstract: We present A1, an agentic execution driven system that transforms any LLM into an end-to-end exploit generator. A1 has no hand-crafted heuristics and provides the agent with six domain-specific tools that enable autonomous vulnerability discovery. The agent can flexibly leverage these tools to understand smart contract behavior, generate exploit strategies, test them on blockchain states, and refine approaches based on execution feedback. All outputs are concretely validated to eliminate false positives.
  The evaluation across 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain demonstrates a 62.96% (17 out of 27) success rate on the VERITE benchmark. Beyond the VERITE dataset, A1 identified 9 additional vulnerable contracts, with 5 cases occurring after the strongest model's training cutoff date. Across all 26 successful cases, A1 extracts up to 8.59 million USD per case and 9.33 million USD total. Through 432 experiments across six LLMs, we analyze iteration-wise performance showing diminishing returns with average marginal gains of +9.7%, +3.7%, +5.1%, and +2.8% for iterations 2-5 respectively, with per-experiment costs ranging $0.01-$3.59. A Monte Carlo analysis of 19 historical attacks shows success probabilities of 85.9%-88.8% without detection delays.
  We investigate whether an attacker or a defender benefits most from deploying A1 as a continuous on-chain scanning system. Our model shows that OpenAI's o3-pro maintains profitability up to a 30.0 days scanning delay at 0.100% vulnerability incidence rates, while faster models require >=1.000% rates to break-even. The findings exposes a troubling asymmetry: at 0.1% vulnerability rates, attackers achieve an on-chain scanning profitability at a $6000 exploit value, while defenders require $60000, raising fundamental questions about whether AI agents inevitably favor exploitation over defense.

Abstract: The integration of Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) presents a compelling pathway for training more powerful, large-scale artificial intelligence models (LAMs) on decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, efficient federated training of these complex MoE-structured LAMs is hindered by significant system-level challenges, particularly in managing the interplay between heterogeneous client resources and the sophisticated coordination required for numerous specialized experts. This article highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust quantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically considers varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wise load balancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent client-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these systemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training mechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way for the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in edge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency.

<title>A Formal Refutation of the Blockchain Trilemma</title>

Abstract: The so-called blockchain trilemma asserts the impossibility of simultaneously achieving scalability, security, and decentralisation within a single blockchain protocol. In this paper, we formally refute that proposition. Employing predicate logic, formal automata theory, computational complexity analysis, and graph-theoretic measures of relay topology--specifically Baran's model of network path redundancy--we demonstrate that the trilemma constitutes a category error, conflates distinct analytical domains, and relies upon unproven causal assumptions. We further expose its reliance on composition fallacies drawn from flawed system implementations. A constructive counterexample is presented: a blockchain protocol exhibiting unbounded transaction throughput, cryptographic security under adversarial load, and multipath decentralised propagation. This example is not hypothetical but grounded in protocol design enabled by compact block relay, SPV verification, and IPv6 multicast. The trilemma is revealed not as a law of protocol architecture, but as a heuristic fallacy sustained by imprecision and design defeatism.

<title>Communication-Efficient Module-Wise Federated Learning for Grasp Pose Detection in Cluttered Environments</title>

Abstract: Grasp pose detection (GPD) is a fundamental capability for robotic autonomy, but its reliance on large, diverse datasets creates significant data privacy and centralization challenges. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but its application to GPD is hindered by the substantial communication overhead of large models, a key issue for resource-constrained robots. To address this, we propose a novel module-wise FL framework that begins by analyzing the learning dynamics of the GPD model's functional components. This analysis identifies slower-converging modules, to which our framework then allocates additional communication effort. This is realized through a two-phase process: a standard full-model training phase is followed by a communication-efficient phase where only the identified subset of slower-converging modules is trained and their partial updates are aggregated. Extensive experiments on the GraspNet-1B dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms standard FedAvg and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy for a given communication budget. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a physical robot validate our approach, showing a superior grasp success rate compared to baseline methods in cluttered scenes. Our work presents a communication-efficient framework for training robust, generalized GPD models in a decentralized manner, effectively improving the trade-off between communication cost and model performance.

Abstract: Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a paradigm for digital identity management that offers unique privacy advantages. A key technology in SSI is Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and their associated metadata, DID Documents (DDOs). DDOs contain crucial verification material such as the public keys of the entity identified by the DID (i.e., the DID subject) and are often anchored on a distributed ledger to ensure security and availability. Long-lived DIDs need to support updates (e.g., key rotation). Ideally, only the DID subject should authorize DDO updates. However, in practice, update capabilities may be shared or delegated. While the DID specification acknowledges such scenarios, it does not define how updates should be authorized when multiple entities jointly control a DID (i.e., group control). This article examines the implementation of an on-chain, trustless mechanism enabling DID controllers under group control to program their governance rules. The main research question is the following: Can a technical mechanism be developed to orchestrate on-chain group control of a DDO in a ledger-agnostic and adaptable manner?

Abstract: This paper presents Wrapless -- a lending protocol that enables the collateralization of bitcoins without requiring a trusted wrapping mechanism. The protocol facilitates a "loan channel" on the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing bitcoins to be locked as collateral for loans issued on any blockchain that supports Turing-complete smart contracts. The protocol is designed in a way that makes it economically irrational for each involved party to manipulate the loan rules. There is still a significant research area to bring the protocol closer to traditional AMM financial instruments.

Abstract: Blockchain bridges have become essential infrastructure for enabling interoperability across different blockchain networks, with more than $24B monthly bridge transaction volume. However, their growing adoption has been accompanied by a disproportionate rise in security breaches, making them the single largest source of financial loss in Web3. For cross-chain ecosystems to be robust and sustainable, it is essential to understand and address these vulnerabilities. In this study, we present a comprehensive systematization of blockchain bridge design and security. We define three bridge security priors, formalize the architectural structure of 13 prominent bridges, and identify 23 attack vectors grounded in real-world blockchain exploits. Using this foundation, we evaluate 43 representative attack scenarios and introduce a layered threat model that captures security failures across source chain, off-chain, and destination chain components.
  Our analysis at the static code and transaction network levels reveals recurring design flaws, particularly in access control, validator trust assumptions, and verification logic, and identifies key patterns in adversarial behavior based on transaction-level traces. To support future development, we propose a decision framework for bridge architecture design, along with defense mechanisms such as layered validation and circuit breakers. This work provides a data-driven foundation for evaluating bridge security and lays the groundwork for standardizing resilient cross-chain infrastructure.

Abstract: This paper focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of Large Language Models at solving embodied robotic tasks using the Meta PARTNER benchmark. Meta PARTNR provides simplified environments and robotic interactions within randomized indoor kitchen scenes. Each randomized kitchen scene is given a task where two robotic agents cooperatively work together to solve the task. We evaluated multiple frontier models on Meta PARTNER environments. Our results indicate that reasoning models like OpenAI o3-mini outperform non-reasoning models like OpenAI GPT-4o and Llama 3 when operating in PARTNR's robotic embodied environments. o3-mini displayed outperform across centralized, decentralized, full observability, and partial observability configurations. This provides a promising avenue of research for embodied robotic development.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified modeling, control, and estimation framework for the quadruple-tank process, a benchmark multivariable system that exhibits either minimum phase or nonminimum phase behavior depending on valve flow ratios. A decentralized PI control strategy is employed to regulate water levels, while a distributed state estimation scheme is developed using local Luenberger observers and inter-agent communication. Each observer uses only local output measurements and exchanges information with neighboring nodes over a strongly connected communication graph. To address the limitations of partial observability, the observer design incorporates an observability decomposition and consensus-based coupling that ensures convergence to the true system state. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating accurate state reconstruction and stable closed loop performance under both minimum-phase and nonminimum phase configurations. These results highlight the potential of combining decentralized control with distributed estimation for scalable, networked control of complex multivariable systems.

<title>StreamDiffusion: A Pipeline-level Solution for Real-time Interactive Generation</title>

Abstract: We introduce StreamDiffusion, a real-time diffusion pipeline designed for interactive image generation. Existing diffusion models are adept at creating images from text or image prompts, yet they often fall short in real-time interaction. This limitation becomes particularly evident in scenarios involving continuous input, such as Metaverse, live video streaming, and broadcasting, where high throughput is imperative. To address this, we present a novel approach that transforms the original sequential denoising into the batching denoising process. Stream Batch eliminates the conventional wait-and-interact approach and enables fluid and high throughput streams. To handle the frequency disparity between data input and model throughput, we design a novel input-output queue for parallelizing the streaming process. Moreover, the existing diffusion pipeline uses classifier-free guidance(CFG), which requires additional U-Net computation. To mitigate the redundant computations, we propose a novel residual classifier-free guidance (RCFG) algorithm that reduces the number of negative conditional denoising steps to only one or even zero. Besides, we introduce a stochastic similarity filter(SSF) to optimize power consumption. Our Stream Batch achieves around 1.5x speedup compared to the sequential denoising method at different denoising levels. The proposed RCFG leads to speeds up to 2.05x higher than the conventional CFG. Combining the proposed strategies and existing mature acceleration tools makes the image-to-image generation achieve up-to 91.07fps on one RTX4090, improving the throughputs of AutoPipline developed by Diffusers over 59.56x. Furthermore, our proposed StreamDiffusion also significantly reduces the energy consumption by 2.39x on one RTX3060 and 1.99x on one RTX4090, respectively.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2412.20866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the inherent immutability of blockchain technology, smart contract updates require their deployment at new addresses rather than modifying existing ones, thus fragmenting version histories and creating critical blind spots for analyses. Indeed, for example, this fragmentation severely hinders security researchers ability to track vulnerability lifecycles across contract versions. While platforms like Etherscan provide detailed information about Ethereum smart contracts, they lack crucial functionality to trace predecessor-successor relationships within smart contract lineages, preventing systematic analysis of how vulnerabilities emerge, propagate, and potentially remain unresolved across versions.To address the challenge of tracing smart contract lineages, we adopt a Design Science Research (DSR) approach and introduce ContractTrace, an automated infrastructure that accurately identifies and links versions of smart contracts into coherent lineages. This tool enables the construction of lineageSet, an up-to-date, open-source dataset specifically designed to support security research on vulnerability, defect or any other property evolution patterns in smart contracts. Through a security-focused case study we demonstrate how ContractTrace reveals previously obscured vulnerability life-cycles within smart contract lineages, tracking whether critical security flaws persist or get resolved across versions. This capability is essential for understanding vulnerability propagation patterns and evaluating the effectiveness of security patches in blockchain environments. In the evaluation phase of our DSR approach, we validated our lineage detection methodology against an alternative approach using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to cluster contract versions, confirming the security relevance and accuracy of our technique.

Abstract: Conthereum is a concurrent Ethereum solution for intra-block parallel transaction execution, enabling validators to utilize multi-core infrastructure and transform the sequential execution model of Ethereum into a parallel one. This shift significantly increases throughput and transactions per second (TPS), while ensuring conflict-free execution in both proposer and attestor modes and preserving execution order consistency in the attestor. At the heart of Conthereum is a novel, lightweight, high-performance scheduler inspired by the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSS). We propose a custom greedy heuristic algorithm, along with its efficient implementation, that solves this formulation effectively and decisively outperforms existing scheduling methods in finding suboptimal solutions that satisfy the constraints, achieve minimal makespan, and maximize speedup in parallel execution. Additionally, Conthereum includes an offline phase that equips its real-time scheduler with a conflict analysis repository obtained through static analysis of smart contracts, identifying potentially conflicting functions using a pessimistic approach. Building on this novel scheduler and extensive conflict data, Conthereum outperforms existing concurrent intra-block solutions. Empirical evaluations show near-linear throughput gains with increasing computational power on standard 8-core machines. Although scalability deviates from linear with higher core counts and increased transaction conflicts, Conthereum still significantly improves upon the current sequential execution model and outperforms existing concurrent solutions under a wide range of conditions.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether Bittensor can be considered the Bitcoin of decentralized Artificial Intelligence by directly comparing its tokenomics, decentralization properties, consensus mechanism, and incentive structure against those of Bitcoin. Leveraging on-chain data from all 64 active Bittensor subnets, we first document considerable concentration in both stake and rewards. We further show that rewards are overwhelmingly driven by stake, highlighting a clear misalignment between quality and compensation. As a remedy, we put forward a series of two-pronged protocol-level interventions. For incentive realignment, our proposed solutions include performance-weighted emission split, composite scoring, and a trust-bonus multiplier. As for mitigating security vulnerability due to stake concentration, we propose and empirically validate stake cap at the 88th percentile, which elevates the median coalition size required for a 51-percent attack and remains robust across daily, weekly, and monthly snapshots.

Abstract: The rapid growth of distributed energy resources (DERs), including rooftop solar and energy storage, is transforming the grid edge, where distributed technologies and customer-side systems increasingly interact with the broader power grid. DER aggregators, entities that coordinate and optimize the actions of many small-scale DERs, play a key role in this transformation. This paper presents a hybrid Mean-Field Control (MFC) and Mean-Field Game (MFG) framework for integrating DER aggregators into wholesale electricity markets. Unlike traditional approaches that treat market prices as exogenous, our model captures the feedback between aggregators' strategies and locational marginal prices (LMPs) of electricity. The MFC component optimizes DER operations within each aggregator, while the MFG models strategic interactions among multiple aggregators. To account for various uncertainties, we incorporate reinforcement learning (RL), which allows aggregators to learn optimal bidding strategies in dynamic market conditions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a mean-field equilibrium and validate the framework through a case study of the Oahu Island power system. Results show that our approach reduces price volatility and improves market efficiency, offering a scalable and decentralized solution for DER integration in wholesale markets.

Abstract: Programmable blockchains have long been a hot research topic given their tremendous use in decentralized applications. Smart contracts, using blockchains as their underlying technology, inherit the desired properties such as verifiability, immutability, and transparency, which make it a great suit in trustless environments.
  In this thesis, we consider several decentralized protocols to be built on blockchains, specifically using smart contracts on Ethereum. We used algorithmic and cryptographic tools in our implementations to further improve the level of security and efficiency beyond the state-of-the-art works. We proposed a new approach called Blind Vote, which is an untraceable, secure, efficient, secrecy-preserving, and fully on-chain electronic voting protocol based on the well-known concept of Chaum's blind signatures. We illustrate that our approach achieves the same security guarantees as previous methods such as Tornado Vote [1], while consuming significantly less gas. Thus, we provide a cheaper and considerably more gas-efficient alternative for anonymous blockchain-based voting. On the other hand, we propose a new family of algorithms for private, trustless auctions that protect bidder identities and bid values while remaining practical for smart contract execution. We ensure trustlessness by running the auction logic in a smart contract, thereby eliminating reliance on any single trusted party. This approach prevents bid tampering, front-running, and collusion by enforcing immutability and decentralized verification of bids. The resulting protocol uniquely combines efficiency, trustlessness, and enduring bid privacy, offering a scalable and secure solution for blockchain-based marketplaces and other decentralized applications.

Abstract: Federated learning with differential privacy suffers from two major costs: each client must transmit $d$-dimensional gradients every round, and the magnitude of DP noise grows with $d$. Yet empirical studies show that gradient updates exhibit strong temporal correlations and lie in a $k$-dimensional subspace with $k \ll d$. Motivated by this, we introduce DOME, a decentralized DP optimization framework in which each client maintains a compact sketch to project gradients into $\mathbb{R}^k$ before privatization and Secure Aggregation. This reduces per-round communication from order $d$ to order $k$ and moves towards a gradient approximation mean-squared error of $\sigma^2 k$. To allow the sketch to span new directions and prevent it from collapsing onto historical gradients, we augment it with random probes orthogonal to historical directions. We prove that our overall protocol satisfies $(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy.

Abstract: Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is crucial for ensuring grid stability and optimizing power generation, particularly in increasingly decentralized and complex systems. While classical approaches such as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail to capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by directly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of GNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP, TransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two real-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our experiments show that while complex architectures like GATv2 and TransformerConv do not consistently outperform their simpler counterparts, models such as GCN and APPNP achieve strong results in low-data or highly disaggregated settings. Nonetheless, the vanilla GAT remains highly competitive across both datasets and offers an additional interpretability layer via attention mechanisms. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights, revealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and meteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is not universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial dependencies are prominent. Finally, we benchmark ensemble-based expert aggregation strategies, showing that uniform or learned combinations can enhance robustness and outperform individual models under data heterogeneity.

Abstract: This work presents a novel decentralized protocol for digital estate planning that integrates advances distributed computing, and cryptography. The original proof-of-concept was constructed using purely solidity contracts. Since then, we have enhanced the implementation into a layer-1 protocol that uses modern interchain communication to connect several heterogeneous chain types. A key contribution of this research is the implementation of several modern cryptographic primitives to support various forms of claims for information validation. These primitives introduce an unmatched level of privacy to the process of digital inheritance. We also demonstrate on a set of heterogeneous smart contracts, following the same spec, on each chain to serve as entry points, gateways, or bridge contracts that are invoked via a path from the will module on our protocol, to the contract. This ensures a fair and secure distribution of digital assets in accordance with the wishes of the decedent without the requirement of moving their funds. This research further extends its innovations with a user interaction model, featuring a check-in system and account abstraction process, which enhances flexibility and user-friendliness without compromising on security. By developing a dedicated permissionless blockchain that is secured by a network of validators, and interchain relayers, the proposed protocol signifies a transformation in the digital estate planning industry and illustrates the potential of blockchain technology in revolutionizing traditional legal and personal spheres. Implementing a cryptoeconomic network at the core of inheritance planning allows for unique incentive compatible economic mechanisms to be constructed.

Abstract: Humans naturally swing their arms during locomotion to regulate whole-body dynamics, reduce angular momentum, and help maintain balance. Inspired by this principle, we present a limb-level multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables coordinated whole-body control of humanoid robots through emergent arm motion. Our approach employs separate actor-critic structures for the arms and legs, trained with centralized critics but decentralized actors that share only base states and centroidal angular momentum (CAM) observations, allowing each agent to specialize in task-relevant behaviors through modular reward design. The arm agent guided by CAM tracking and damping rewards promotes arm motions that reduce overall angular momentum and vertical ground reaction moments, contributing to improved balance during locomotion or under external perturbations. Comparative studies with single-agent and alternative multi-agent baselines further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on a humanoid platform, achieving robust performance across diverse locomotion tasks, including flat-ground walking, rough terrain traversal, and stair climbing.

Abstract: South Korea's City P illustrates how lofty goals of digital solidarity can falter when challenged by local governance realities. Drawing on Hansmann's ownership theory, collaborative governance concepts, and platform cooperativism, we conducted a qualitative case study involving policy documents, independent assessments, and 11 in-depth interviews with residents, officials, and technology developers. Findings reveal a marked disconnect between the initiative's stated emphasis on community co-ownership and the actual power dynamics that largely favored government agencies and external firms. Although blockchain and integrated digital tools were meant to enhance transparency and inclusivity, stakeholders--especially elderly residents--experienced confusion and mistrust. We argue that genuine collaboration in digital solidarity economies requires not only robust technical designs but also culturally resonant ownership structures, substantive inclusion of local voices, and transparent governance mechanisms. The City P case underscores the necessity of addressing heterogeneous digital capacities, aligning funding and incentives with grassroots empowerment, and mitigating performative participation to ensure meaningful and sustainable outcomes in community-based digital innovation.

<title>Static Analysis for Detecting Transaction Conflicts in Ethereum Smart Contracts</title>

Abstract: Ethereum smart contracts operate in a concurrent environment where multiple transactions can be submitted simultaneously. However, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) enforces sequential execution of transactions within each block to prevent conflicts arising from concurrent access to the same state variables. Although this approach guarantees correct behavior, it limits the ability of validators to leverage multi-core architectures for faster transaction processing, thus restricting throughput. Existing solutions introduce concurrency by allowing simultaneous transaction execution combined with runtime conflict detection and rollback mechanisms to maintain correctness. However, these methods incur significant overhead due to continuous conflict tracking and transaction reversion. Recently, alternative approaches have emerged that aim to predict conflicts statically, before execution, by analyzing smart contract code for potential transaction interactions. Despite their promise, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that examine static conflict detection and its broader implications in specific smart contracts. This paper fills this important gap by proposing a novel static analysis method to detect potential transaction conflicts in Ethereum smart contracts. Our method identifies read-write, write-write, and function call conflicts between transaction pairs by analyzing state variable access patterns in Solidity contracts. We implement a tool that parses contract code and performs conflict detection. Evaluation on a dataset of real-world Ethereum smart contracts demonstrates that our approach achieves high precision in identifying potential conflicts. By enabling proactive conflict detection, our tool supports further design of transaction scheduling strategies that reduce runtime failures, enhance validator throughput, and contribute to blockchain scalability.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to ecosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication protocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular Open Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols. Unlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents (agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge representations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key innovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central coordination.

<title>NourID+: A Digital Energy Identity Framework for Efficient Subsidy Allocation in Morocco</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04424</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce NourID+, a digital energy identity framework that addresses Morocco's need for trusted energy subsidy allocation through authenticated digital identity integration. NourID+ creates a strong foundation for future subsidy programs by unifying three government-issued and digitalized credentials: Moroccan national identity cards (CIN), cadastral plans, and property ownership certificates are transformed into unique digital energy IDs (DE-IDs) that map authenticated identities with specific properties and their energy consumption patterns. The system supports three property ownership profiles: farmers (landowners), entrepreneurs (factory or company owners), and households (house owners), as energy consumption is directly related to land ownership. NourID+ provides dual access through a government portal allowing officials to process DE-ID generation requests, as well as a citizen portal for DE-ID usage and energy monitoring. Our framework supports CIN upload with facial biometric matching, automated property retrieval through government APIs, and government officer approval workflow for DE-ID generation. After evaluation of the system, we demonstrate a reduction in verification time from weeks to minutes, with 98% accuracy of document validation. The proposed solution allows for targeted subsidy allocation of electricity based on actual consumption needs rather than estimations, potentially improving the efficiency of Morocco's significant energy subsidy expenditure.

<title>Truthful, Credible, and Optimal Auctions for Matroids via Blockchains and Commitments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04592</link>

Abstract: We consider a revenue-optimizing auctioneer in single-dimensional environments with matroid feasibility constraints. Akbarpour and Li (2020) argue that any revenue-optimal, truthful, and credible mechanism requires unbounded communication. Recent works (Ferreira and Weinberg, 2020; Essaidi et al., 2022; Chitra et al., 2024) circumvent their impossibility for the single-item setting through the use of cryptographic commitments and blockchains. We extend their results to matroid feasibility constraints.
  At a high level, the two-round Deferred-Revelation Auction (DRA) discussed by Ferreira and Weinberg (2020) and Chitra et al., (2024) requires each bidder to submit a deposit, which is slashed upon presenting verifiable evidence indicating a deviation from the behaviour prescribed by the mechanism. We prove that the DRA satisfies truthfulness, credibility and revenue-optimality for all matroid environments when bidders' values are drawn from $\alpha$-strongly regular distributions for $\alpha > 0$. Further, we argue that the DRA is not credible for any feasibility constraint beyond matroids and for any smaller deposits than suggested by previous literature even in single-item environments.
  Finally, we modify the Ascending Deferred-Revelation Auction (ADRA) for single-item settings proposed by Essaidi et al., (2022) for arbitrary bidder value distributions. We implement a deferred-revelation variant of the deferred-acceptance auction for matroids due to Bikhchandani et al., (2011), which requires the same bounded communication as the ADRA.

<title>Operator-based machine learning framework for generalizable prediction of unsteady treatment dynamics in stormwater infrastructure</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04682</link>

Abstract: Stormwater infrastructures are decentralized urban water-management systems that face highly unsteady hydraulic and pollutant loadings from episodic rainfall-runoff events. Accurately evaluating their in-situ treatment performance is essential for cost-effective design and planning. Traditional lumped dynamic models (e.g., continuously stirred tank reactor, CSTR) are computationally efficient but oversimplify transport and reaction processes, limiting predictive accuracy and insight. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) resolves detailed turbulent transport and pollutant fate physics but incurs prohibitive computational cost for unsteady and long-term simulations. To address these limitations, this study develops a composite operator-based neural network (CPNN) framework that leverages state-of-the-art operator learning to predict the spatial and temporal dynamics of hydraulics and particulate matter (PM) in stormwater treatment. The framework is demonstrated on a hydrodynamic separator (HS), a common urban treatment device. Results indicate that the CPNN achieves R2 > 0.8 for hydraulic predictions in 95.2% of test cases; for PM concentration predictions, R2 > 0.8 in 72.6% of cases and 0.4 < R2 < 0.8 in 22.6%. The analysis identifies challenges in capturing dynamics under extreme low-flow conditions, owing to their lower contribution to the training loss. Exploiting the automatic-differentiation capability of the CPNN, sensitivity analyses quantify the influence of storm event loading on PM transport. Finally, the potential of the CPNN framework for continuous, long-term evaluation of stormwater infrastructure performance is discussed, marking a step toward robust, climate-aware planning and implementation.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. While LLM-MAS exhibit strong collaborative abilities, the security risks in their communication and coordination remain underexplored. We bridge this gap by systematically investigating intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS, and design four representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while maintaining high concealment. These attacks are evaluated in centralized, decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, GSM8K, arithmetic, and biographies, demonstrate that they exhibit strong disruptive capabilities. To identify these threats, we propose a psychology-based detection framework AgentXposed, which combines the HEXACO personality model with the Reid Technique, using progressive questionnaire inquiries and behavior-based monitoring. Experiments conducted on six types of attacks show that our detection framework effectively identifies all types of malicious behaviors. The detection rate for our intention-hiding attacks is slightly lower than that of the two baselines, Incorrect Fact Injection and Dark Traits Injection, demonstrating the effectiveness of intention concealment. Our findings reveal the structural and behavioral risks posed by intention-hiding attacks and offer valuable insights into securing LLM-based multi-agent systems through psychological perspectives, which contributes to a deeper understanding of multi-agent safety. The code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AgentXposed-F814.

<title>Bullshark on Narwhal: Implementation-level Workflow Analysis of Round-based DAG Consensus in Theory and Practice</title>

arXiv:2507.04956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Round-based DAGs enable high-performance Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus, yet their technical advantages remain underutilized due to their short history. While research on consensus protocols is active in both academia and industry, many studies overlook implementation-level algorithms, leaving actual performance unclear - particularly for theoretical protocols whose practical performance cannot often be evaluated. Bullshark, a Round-based DAG BFT protocol on Narwhal mempool, achieves optimal performance: 297,000 transactions per second with 2-second latency. We analyze the algorithm's workflow, from transaction submission to blockchain commitment, breaking it down layer by layer at the functional level and delineating the key features and interactions of the Bullshark and Narwhal components. Future work aims to improve performance in Byzantine fault environments and optimize trade-offs in the CAP theorem.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Darwinian Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) methodology formacroeconomic forecasting that leverages evolutionary principles to achieve remarkablecomputational efficiency and emergent realism. Unlike conventional DSGE and ABM approachesthat rely on complex behavioral rules derived from large firm analysis, our framework employssimple "common sense" rules representative of small firms directly serving final consumers. Themethodology treats households as the primary drivers of economic dynamics, with firms adaptingthrough market-based natural selection within limited interaction neighborhoods. We demonstrate that this approach, when constrained by Input-Output table structures,generates realistic economic patterns including wealth distributions, firm size distributions, andsectoral employment patterns without extensive parameter calibration. Using FIGARO Input-Output tables for 46 countries and focusing on Austria as a case study, we show that the modelreproduces empirical regularities while maintaining computational efficiency on standard laptopsrather than requiring supercomputing clusters. Key findings include: (1) emergence of realistic firm and employment distributions fromminimal behavioral assumptions, (2) accurate reproduction of the initial Social Accounting Matrixvalues through evolutionary dynamics, (3) successful calibration using only 5-6 country-specificparameters to complement the FIGARO data, and (4) computational performance enabling fullsimulations on consumer hardware. These results suggest that evolutionary ABM approaches canprovide robust policy insights by capturing decentralized market adaptations while avoiding thecomputational complexity of traditional DSGE and comprehensive ABM models.

Abstract: We introduce semitopologies, a generalisation of point-set topology that removes the restriction that intersections of open sets need necessarily be open.
  The intuition is that points are participants in some distributed system, and an open set is a collection of participants that can collaborate to update their local state by taking a distributed collaborative action; we call this an actionable coalition. What constitutes an actionable coalition depends on what actions we want to model. Intuitive examples include 'a group of people that is collectively strong enough to lift a rock', where the state update is very simply 'holding rock low' to 'holding rock high' and this update is common to all participants in the actionable coalition. Or, consider 'two people wishing to barter a can of juice for a bar of chocolate', in which case the coalition is any such pair and the state updates differ between participants to flip them between 'has/has no juice' and 'has/has no chocolate'. A characteristic of these systems is that state updates are local to the coalition, voluntary, may vary between participants, and are not assumed subject to permission or synchronisation by a central authority. Peer-to-peer computer networks, including filesharing and blockchain systems, provide motivating examples from computing.
  This monograph presents a comprehensive view of semitopologies which includes point-set semitopology, algebra, and logic inspired by these considerations. This is interesting in and of itself and it provides a conceptual framework within which to understand a useful class of distributed systems.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrates into diverse areas, particularly in content generation, ensuring rightful ownership and ethical use becomes paramount, AI service providers are expected to prioritize responsibly sourcing training data and obtaining licenses from data owners. However, existing studies primarily center on safeguarding static copyrights, which simply treat metadata/datasets as non-fungible items with transferable/trading capabilities, neglecting the dynamic nature of training procedures that can shape an ongoing trajectory. In this paper, we present \textsc{IBis}, a blockchain-based framework tailored for AI model training workflows. Our design can dynamically manage copyright compliance and data provenance in decentralized AI model training processes, ensuring that intellectual property rights are respected throughout iterative model enhancements and licensing updates. Technically, \textsc{IBis} integrates on-chain registries for datasets, licenses and models, alongside off-chain signing services to facilitate collaboration among multiple participants. Further, \textsc{IBis} provides APIs designed for seamless integration with existing contract management software, minimizing disruptions to established model training processes. We implement \textsc{IBis} using Daml on the Canton blockchain. Evaluation results showcase the feasibility and scalability of \textsc{IBis} across varying numbers of users, datasets, models, and licenses.

<title>Curvature-Aligned Federated Learning (CAFe): Harmonizing Loss Landscapes for Fairness Without Demographics</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training, making it well-suited for decentralized human-sensing applications. Ensuring fairness in FL is challenging, as current methods rely on sensitive attribute knowledge, which conflicts with FL's privacy principles. Additionally, sensitive attributes in human-sensing data may be unknown or latent. To address this, we introduce Curvature-Aligned Federated Learning (CAFe), a theoretically grounded approach that achieves fairness in FL without requiring sensitive attribute knowledge, a concept termed "Fairness without Demographics" (FWD). CAFe introduces loss-landscape curvature regularization during local training and clients' loss-landscape sharpness-aware aggregation to align curvature both within and across clients, enabling a strong balance between higher fairness and performance. CAFe is especially suitable for real-world human-sensing FL scenarios involving single or multi-user edge devices with unknown or multiple bias factors. We validated CAFe through theoretical and empirical justifications, and comprehensive evaluations using three real-world datasets and a live real-world FL deployment with a heterogeneous testbed of resource-constrained devices. Additionally, we conduct sensitivity analyses on local training data volume, client sampling, communication overhead, resource costs, and runtime performance to demonstrate its feasibility for practical FL edge device deployment.

Abstract: This paper introduces a blockchain-based insurance scheme that integrates parametric and collaborative elements. A pool of investors, referred to as surplus providers, locks funds in a smart contract, enabling blockchain users to underwrite parametric insurance contracts. These contracts automatically trigger compensation when predefined conditions are met. The collaborative aspect is embodied in the generation of tokens, which are distributed to surplus providers. These tokens represent each participant's share of the surplus and grant voting rights for management decisions. The smart contract is developed in Solidity, a high-level programming language for the Ethereum blockchain, and deployed on the Sepolia testnet, with data processing and analysis conducted using Python. In addition, open-source code is provided and main research challenges are identified, so that further research can be carried out to overcome limitations of this first proof of concept.

Abstract: 5G networks provide secure and reliable information transmission services for the Internet of Everything, thus paving the way for 6G networks, which is anticipated to be an AI-based network, supporting unprecedented intelligence across applications. Abundant computing resources will establish the 6G Computing Power Network (CPN) to facilitate ubiquitous intelligent services. In this article, we propose BECS, a computing sharing mechanism based on evolutionary algorithm and blockchain, designed to balance task offloading among user devices, edge devices, and cloud resources within 6G CPN, thereby enhancing the computing resource utilization. We model computing sharing as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to improve resource utilization while balancing other issues. To tackle this NP-hard problem, we devise a kernel distance-based dominance relation and incorporated it into the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III, significantly enhancing the diversity of the evolutionary population. In addition, we propose a pseudonym scheme based on zero-knowledge proof to protect the privacy of users participating in computing sharing. Finally, the security analysis and simulation results demonstrate that BECS can fully and effectively utilize all computing resources in 6G CPN, significantly improving the computing resource utilization while protecting user privacy.

Abstract: Decentralized data sovereignty and secure data exchange are regarded as foundational pillars of the new era. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a promising solution that enables fine-grained access control in data sharing. Recently, Hohenberger et al. (Eurocrypt 2023) introduced registered ABE (RABE) to eliminate trusted authority and gain decentralization. Users generate their own public and secret keys and then register their keys and attributes with a transparent key curator. However, RABE still suffers from heavy decryption overhead. A natural approach to address this issue is to outsource decryption to a decryption cloud server (DCS). In this work, we propose the first auditable RABE scheme with reliable outsourced decryption (ORABE) based on blockchain. First, we achieve verifiability of transform ciphertext via a verifiable tag mechanism. Then, the exemptibility, which ensures that the DCS escapes false accusations, is guaranteed by zero knowledge fraud proof under the optimistic assumption. Additionally, our system achieves fairness and auditability to protect the interests of all parties through blockchain. Finally, we give concrete security and theoretical analysis and evaluate our scheme on Ethereum to demonstrate feasibility and efficiency.

Abstract: Distributed backdoor attacks (DBA) have shown a higher attack success rate than centralized attacks in centralized federated learning (FL). However, it has not been investigated in the decentralized FL. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate that, while directly applying DBA to decentralized FL, the attack success rate depends on the distribution of attackers in the network architecture. Considering that the attackers can not decide their location, this paper aims to achieve a high attack success rate regardless of the attackers' location distribution. Specifically, we first design a method to detect the network by predicting the distance between any two attackers on the network. Then, based on the distance, we organize the attackers in different clusters. Lastly, we propose an algorithm to \textit{dynamically} embed local patterns decomposed from a global pattern into the different attackers in each cluster. We conduct a thorough empirical investigation and find that our method can, in benchmark datasets, outperform both centralized attacks and naive DBA in different decentralized frameworks.

arXiv:2210.04334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper designs methods for decentralized multiple hypothesis testing on graphs that are equipped with provable guarantees on the false discovery rate (FDR). We consider the setting where distinct agents reside on the nodes of an undirected graph, and each agent possesses p-values corresponding to one or more hypotheses local to its node. Each agent must individually decide whether to reject one or more of its local hypotheses by only communicating with its neighbors, with the joint aim that the global FDR over the entire graph must be controlled at a predefined level. We propose a simple decentralized family of Query-Test-Exchange (QuTE) algorithms and prove that they can control FDR under independence or positive dependence of the p-values. Our algorithm reduces to the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) algorithm when after graph-diameter rounds of communication, and to the Bonferroni procedure when no communication has occurred or the graph is empty. To avoid communicating real-valued p-values, we develop a quantized BH procedure, and extend it to a quantized QuTE procedure. QuTE works seamlessly in streaming data settings, where anytime-valid p-values may be continually updated at each node. Last, QuTE is robust to arbitrary dropping of packets, or a graph that changes at every step, making it particularly suitable to mobile sensor networks involving drones or other multi-agent systems. We study the power of our procedure using a simulation suite of different levels of connectivity and communication on a variety of graph structures, and also provide an illustrative real-world example.

<title>Can Artificial Intelligence solve the blockchain oracle problem? Unpacking the Challenges and Possibilities</title>

Abstract: The blockchain oracle problem, which refers to the challenge of injecting reliable external data into decentralized systems, remains a fundamental limitation to the development of trustless applications. While recent years have seen a proliferation of architectural, cryptographic, and economic strategies to mitigate this issue, no one has yet fully resolved the fundamental question of how a blockchain can gain knowledge about the off-chain world. In this position paper, we critically assess the role artificial intelligence (AI) can play in tackling the oracle problem. Drawing from both academic literature and practitioner implementations, we examine how AI techniques such as anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance can enhance oracle systems. We observe that while AI introduces powerful tools for improving data quality, source selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on unverifiable off-chain inputs. Therefore, this study supports the idea that AI should be understood as a complementary layer of inference and filtering within a broader oracle design, not a substitute for trust assumptions.

Abstract: Homomorphic ring signature schemes combine the strong anonymity of ring signatures with the computability of homomorphic signatures, demonstrating significant potential in scenarios requiring both anonymous data provenance and verifiable homomorphic computation (e.g., confidential blockchain transactions and secure multi-party computation). However, no feasible homomorphic ring signature scheme currently exists.
  In this work, we propose the first lattice-based linearly homomorphic ring signature scheme. Proven secure in the standard model under the small integer solution (SIS) assumption, our scheme achieves strong anonymity under full key exposure and unforgeability against insider corruption attacks. As the first unified framework for ring signatures and linear homomorphic signatures, this construction provides a post-quantum-secure solution for the aforementioned applications, advancing the development of privacy-enhanced homomorphic computation.

Abstract: The emerging Web3 has great potential to provide worldwide decentralized services powered by global-range data-driven networks in the future. To ensure the security of Web3 services among diverse user entities, a decentralized identity (DID) system is essential. Especially, a user's access request to Web3 services can be treated as a DID transaction within the blockchain, executed through a consensus mechanism. However, a critical implementation issue arises in the current Web3, i.e., how to deploy network nodes to serve users on a global scale. To address this issue, emerging Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems, such as Starlink, offer a promising solution. With their global coverage and high reliability, these communication satellites can complement terrestrial networks as Web3 deployment infrastructures. In this case, this paper develops three hybrid satellite-ground modes to deploy the blockchain-enabled DID system for Web3 users. Three modes integrate ground nodes and satellites to provide flexible and continuous DID services for worldwide users. Meanwhile, to evaluate the effectiveness of the present hybrid deployment modes, we analyze the complete DID consensus performance of blockchain on three hybrid satellite-ground modes. Moreover, we conduct numerical and simulation experiments to verify the effectiveness of three hybrid satellite-ground modes. The impacts of various system parameters are thoroughly analyzed, providing valuable insights for implementing the worldwide Web3 DID system in real-world network environments.

Abstract: Immutability is a core design goal of permissionless public blockchain systems. However, rewrites are more common than is normally understood, and the risk of rewrite, cyberattack, exploit or black swan event is also high. Taking the position that strict immutability is neither possible on these networks nor the observed reality, this paper uses thematic analysis of node operator interviews to examine the limits of immutability in light of rewrite events. The end result is a qualitative definition of the conditional immutability found on these networks, which we call Practical Immutability. This is immutability contingent on the legitimate governance demands of the network, where network stakeholders place their trust in the governance topology of a network to lend it legitimacy, and thus manage ledger state.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models, we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

<title>TUC-PPO: Team Utility-Constrained Proximal Policy Optimization for Spatial Public Goods Games</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02675</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02675</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.02675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Team Utility-Constrained Proximal Policy Optimization (TUC-PPO), a new deep reinforcement learning framework. It extends Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by integrating team welfare objectives specifically for spatial public goods games. Unlike conventional approaches where cooperation emerges indirectly from individual rewards, TUC-PPO instead optimizes a bi-level objective integrating policy gradients and team utility constraints. Consequently, all policy updates explicitly incorporate collective payoff thresholds. The framework preserves PPO's policy gradient core while incorporating constrained optimization through adaptive Lagrangian multipliers. Therefore, decentralized agents dynamically balance selfish and cooperative incentives. The comparative analysis demonstrates superior performance of this constrained deep reinforcement learning approach compared to unmodified PPO and evolutionary game theory baselines. It achieves faster convergence to cooperative equilibria and greater stability against invasion by defectors. The framework formally integrates team objectives into policy updates. This work advances multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for social dilemmas while providing new computational tools for evolutionary game theory research.

Abstract: From viral jokes to a billion-dollar phenomenon, meme coins have become one of the most popular segments in cryptocurrency markets. Unlike utility-focused crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, meme coins derive value primarily from community sentiment, making them vulnerable to manipulation. This study presents a cross-chain analysis of the meme coin ecosystem, examining 34,988 tokens across Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Solana, and Base. We characterize the tokenomics of meme coins and track their growth in a three-month longitudinal analysis. We discover that among high-return tokens (>100%), an alarming 82.6% show evidence of extensive use of artificial growth strategies designed to create a misleading appearance of market interest. These include wash trading and a form of manipulation we define as Liquidity Pool-Based Price Inflation (LPI), where small strategic purchases trigger dramatic price increases. We also find evidence of schemes designed to profit at the expense of investors, such as pump and dumps and rug pulls. In particular, most of the tokens involved had previously experienced wash trading or LPI, indicating how initial manipulations often set the stage for later exploitation. These findings reveal that manipulations are widespread among high-performing meme coins and suggest that their dramatic gains are often likely driven by coordinated efforts rather than natural market dynamics.

Abstract: Distributed learning has many computational benefits but is vulnerable to attacks from a subset of devices transmitting incorrect information. This paper investigates Byzantine-resilient algorithms in a decentralized setting, where devices communicate directly in a peer-to-peer manner within a communication network. We leverage the so-called dual approach for decentralized optimization and propose a Byzantine-robust algorithm. We provide convergence guarantees in the average consensus subcase, discuss the potential of the dual approach beyond this subcase, and re-interpret existing algorithms using the dual framework. Lastly, we experimentally show the soundness of our method.

<title>DARTS: A Dual-View Attack Framework for Targeted Manipulation in Federated Sequential Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Federated recommendation (FedRec) preserves user privacy by enabling decentralized training of personalized models, but this architecture is inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Significant research has been conducted on targeted attacks in FedRec systems, motivated by commercial and social influence considerations. However, much of this work has largely overlooked the differential robustness of recommendation models. Moreover, our empirical findings indicate that existing targeted attack methods achieve only limited effectiveness in Federated Sequential Recommendation(FSR) tasks. Driven by these observations, we focus on investigating targeted attacks in FSR and propose a novel dualview attack framework, named DV-FSR. This attack method uniquely combines a sampling-based explicit strategy with a contrastive learning-based implicit gradient strategy to orchestrate a coordinated attack. Additionally, we introduce a specific defense mechanism tailored for targeted attacks in FSR, aiming to evaluate the mitigation effects of the attack method we proposed. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach on representative sequential models. Our codes are publicly available.

<title>Rational Censorship Attack: Breaking Blockchain with a Blackboard</title>

Abstract: Censorship resilience is a fundamental assumption underlying the security of blockchain protocols. Additionally, the analysis of blockchain security from an economic and game theoretic perspective has been growing in popularity in recent years. In this work, we present a surprising rational censorship attack on blockchain censorship resilience when we adopt the analysis of blockchain security from a game theoretic lens and assume all users are rational. In our attack, a colluding group with sufficient voting power censors the remainder nodes such that the group alone can gain all the rewards from maintaining the blockchain. We show that if nodes are rational, coordinating this attack just requires a public read and write blackboard and we formally model the attack using a game theoretic framework. Furthermore, we note that to ensure the success of the attack, nodes need to know the total true voting power held by the colluding group. We prove that the strategy to join the rational censorship attack and also for nodes to honestly declare their power is a subgame perfect equilibrium in the corresponding extensive form game induced by our attack. Finally, we discuss the implications of the attack on blockchain users and protocol designers as well as some potential countermeasures.

<title>EDGChain-E: A Decentralized Git-Based Framework for Versioning Encrypted Energy Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.01615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new decentralized framework, named EDGChain-E (Encrypted-Data-Git Chain for Energy), designed to manage version-controlled, encrypted energy data using blockchain and the InterPlanetary File System. The framework incorporates a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to orchestrate collaborative data governance across the lifecycle of energy research and operations, such as smart grid monitoring, demand forecasting, and peer-to-peer energy trading. In EDGChain-E, initial commits capture the full encrypted datasets-such as smart meter readings or grid telemetry-while subsequent updates are tracked as encrypted Git patches, ensuring integrity, traceability, and privacy. This versioning mechanism supports secure collaboration across multiple stakeholders (e.g., utilities, researchers, regulators) without compromising sensitive or regulated information. We highlight the framework's capability to maintain FAIR-compliant (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) provenance of encrypted data. By embedding hash-based content identifiers in Merkle trees, the system enables transparent, auditable, and immutable tracking of data changes, thereby supporting reproducibility and trust in decentralized energy applications.

<title>EGNInfoLeaker: Unveiling the Risks of Public Key Reuse and User Identity Leakage in Blockchain</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.01635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Ethereum's discovery protocols (Discv4/ Discv5) incorporate robust cryptographic designs to protect user privacy, real-world deployment reveals critical vulnerabilities when users deviate from security guidelines. In this paper, we design a system called EGNInfoLeaker. Our study is the first work that uncovers widespread public key reuse across Ethereum's peer-to-peer networks - a practice that fundamentally undermines the protocol's privacy guarantees. Through systematic analysis of 300 real-world network snapshots, we identify 83 users controlling 483 service nodes via public key reuse, enabling precise de-anonymization through IP correlation. Using evidence collected by EGNInfoLeaker, our Graph-Based Identity Association Algorithm links users to network entities and generates comprehensive user profiles. For User27, it exposes the public key, IP, network ID, location (country/region/city), and ISP/ORG details. The EGNInfoLeaker system demonstrates how such cryptographic misuse transforms theoretical anonymity into practical identity leakage, exposing users to surveillance and targeted attacks. These findings establish that protocol security depends not only on sound design but also on strict user compliance. Going forward, our detection framework provides a foundation for enhancing real-world privacy preservation in decentralized networks.

<title>Distance-based Relative Orbital Transition for Satellite Swarm Array Deployment Under J2 Perturbation</title>

arXiv:2507.01769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an autonomous guidance and control strategy for a satellite swarm that enables scalable distributed space structures for innovative science and business opportunities. The averaged $J_2$ orbital parameters that describe the drift and periodic orbital motion were derived along with their target values to achieve a distributed space structure in a decentralized manner. This enabled the design of a distance-based orbital stabilizer to ensure autonomous deployment into a monolithic formation of a coplanar equidistant configuration on a user-defined orbital plane. Continuous formation control was assumed to be achieved through fuel-free actuation, such as satellite magnetic field interaction and differential aerodynamic forces, thereby maintaining long-term formation stability without thruster usage. A major challenge for such actuation systems is the potential loss of control capability due to increasing inter-satellite distances resulting from unstable orbital dynamics, particularly for autonomous satellite swarms. To mitigate this risk, our decentralized deployment controller minimized drift distance during unexpected communication outages. As a case study, we consider the deployment of palm-sized satellites into a coplanar equidistant formation in a $J_2$-perturbed orbit. Moreover, centralized grouping strategies are presented.

Yet, their significant computational demands raise issues of environmental impact and the risk of centralized control in their development. We put forward a vision towards decentralized and sustainable foundation model training that leverages the collective compute of sparingly used connected edge AI devices. We present the rationale behind our vision, particularly in support of its sustainability benefit. We further outline a set of challenges that need to be addressed to turn this vision into reality.

Abstract: This work views the multi-agent system and its surrounding environment as a co-evolving system, where the behavior of one affects the other. The goal is to take both agent actions and environment configurations as decision variables, and optimize these two components in a coordinated manner to improve some measure of interest. Towards this end, we consider the problem of decentralized multi-agent navigation in a cluttered environment, where we assume that the layout of the environment is reconfigurable. By introducing two sub-objectives -- multi-agent navigation and environment optimization -- we propose an agent-environment co-optimization problem and develop a coordinated algorithm that alternates between these sub-objectives to search for an optimal synthesis of agent actions and environment configurations; ultimately, improving the navigation performance. Due to the challenge of explicitly modeling the relation between the agents, the environment and their performance therein, we leverage policy gradient to formulate a model-free learning mechanism within the coordinated framework. A formal convergence analysis shows that our coordinated algorithm tracks the local minimum solution of an associated time-varying non-convex optimization problem. Experiments corroborate theoretical findings and show the benefits of co-optimization. Interestingly, the results also indicate that optimized environments can offer structural guidance to de-conflict agents in motion.

<title>On the Trade-off between Flatness and Optimization in Distributed Learning</title>

arXiv:2406.20006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical framework to evaluate and compare the performance of stochastic gradient algorithms for distributed learning in relation to their behavior around local minima in nonconvex environments. Previous works have noticed that convergence toward flat local minima tend to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms. This work discovers three interesting results. First, it shows that decentralized learning strategies are able to escape faster away from local minima and favor convergence toward flatter minima relative to the centralized solution. Second, in decentralized methods, the consensus strategy has a worse excess-risk performance than diffusion, giving it a better chance of escaping from local minima and favoring flatter minima. Third, and importantly, the ultimate classification accuracy is not solely dependent on the flatness of the local minimum but also on how well a learning algorithm can approach that minimum. In other words, the classification accuracy is a function of both flatness and optimization performance. In this regard, since diffusion has a lower excess-risk than consensus, when both algorithms are trained starting from random initial points, diffusion enhances the classification accuracy. The paper examines the interplay between the two measures of flatness and optimization error closely. One important conclusion is that decentralized strategies deliver in general enhanced classification accuracy because they strike a more favorable balance between flatness and optimization performance compared to the centralized solution.

<title>Thunderbolt: Concurrent Smart Contract Execution with Non-blocking Reconfiguration for Sharded DAGs</title>

Abstract: Sharding has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing blockchain system scalability. However, existing sharding approaches face unique challenges when applied to Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based protocols that integrate expressive smart contract processing. Current solutions predominantly rely on coordination mechanisms like 2PC and require transaction read/write sets to optimize parallel execution. These requirements introduce two fundamental limitations: 1) additional coordination phases incur latency overhead, and 2) pre-declaration of read/write sets proves impractical for Turing-complete smart contracts with dynamic access patterns.
  This paper presents Thunderbolt, a novel sharding architecture for both single-shard transactions (Single-shard TXs) and cross-shard transactions (Cross-shard TXs) and enables nonblocking reconfiguration to ensure system liveness. Our design introduces 4 key innovations: 1) each replica serves dual roles as a full-shard representative and transaction proposer, employing the Execution-Order-Validation (EOV) model for Single-shard TXs and Order-Execution (OE) model for Cross-shard TXs. 2) we develop a DAG-based coordination protocol that establishes deterministic ordering between two transaction types while preserving concurrent execution capabilities. 3) we implement a dynamic concurrency controller that schedules Single-shard TXs without requiring prior knowledge of read/write sets, enabling runtime dependency resolution. 4) Thunderbolt introduces a nonblocking shard reconfiguration mechanism to address censorship attacks by featuring frequent shard re-assignment without impeding the construction of DAG nor blocking consensus. Thunderbolt achieves a 50x throughput improvement with 64 replicas compared to serial execution in the Tusk framework.

Abstract: In the era of Web3, decentralized technologies have emerged as the cornerstone of a new digital paradigm. Backed by a decentralized blockchain architecture, the Web3 space aims to democratize all aspects of the web. From data-sharing to learning models, outsourcing computation is an established, prevalent practice. Verifiable computation makes this practice trustworthy as clients/users can now efficiently validate the integrity of a computation. As verifiable computation gets considered for applications in the Web3 space, decentralization is crucial for system reliability, ensuring that no single entity can suppress clients. At the same time, however, decentralization needs to be balanced with efficiency: clients want their computations done as quickly as possible.
  Motivated by these issues, we study the trade-off between decentralization and efficiency when outsourcing computational tasks to strategic, rational solution providers. Specifically, we examine this trade-off when the client employs (1) revelation mechanisms, i.e. auctions, where solution providers bid their desired reward for completing the task by a specific deadline and then the client selects which of them will do the task and how much they will be rewarded, and (2) simple, non-revelation mechanisms, where the client commits to the set of rules she will use to map solutions at specific times to rewards and then solution providers decide whether they want to do the task or not. We completely characterize the power and limitations of revelation and non-revelation mechanisms in our model.

<title>Adaptive Traffic Signal Control based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Case Study on a simulated real-world corridor</title>

Abstract: Previous studies that have formulated multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control have primarily used value-based RL methods. However, recent literature has shown that policy-based methods may perform better in partially observable environments. Additionally, RL methods remain largely untested for real-world normally signal timing plans because of the simplifying assumptions common in the literature. The current study attempts to address these gaps and formulates a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO) algorithm to implement adaptive and coordinated traffic control along an arterial corridor. The formulated MA-PPO has a centralized-critic architecture under a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. Agents are designed to allow selection and implementation of up to eight signal phases, as commonly implemented in field controllers. The formulated algorithm is tested on a simulated real-world seven intersection corridor. The speed of convergence for each agent was found to depend on the size of the action space, which depends on the number and sequence of signal phases. The performance of the formulated MA-PPO adaptive control algorithm is compared with the field implemented actuated-coordinated signal control (ASC), modeled using PTV-Vissim-MaxTime software in the loop simulation (SILs). The trained MA-PPO performed significantly better than the ASC for all movements. Compared to ASC the MA-PPO showed 2% and 24% improvements in travel time in the primary and secondary coordination directions, respectively. For cross streets movements MA-PPO also showed significant crossing time reductions. Volume sensitivity experiments revealed that the formulated MA-PPO demonstrated good stability, robustness, and adaptability to changes in traffic demand.

Abstract: Alternative Assets tokenization is transforming non-traditional financial instruments are represented and traded on the web. However, ensuring trustworthiness in web-based tokenized ecosystems poses significant challenges, from verifying off-chain asset data to enforcing regulatory compliance. This paper proposes an AI-governed agent architecture that integrates intelligent agents with blockchain to achieve web-trustworthy tokenization of alternative assets. In the proposed architecture, autonomous agents orchestrate the tokenization process (asset verification, valuation, compliance checking, and lifecycle management), while an AI-driven governance layer monitors agent behavior and enforces trust through adaptive policies and cryptoeconomic incentives. We demonstrate that this approach enhances transparency, security, and compliance in asset tokenization, addressing key concerns around data authenticity and fraud. A case study on tokenizing real estate assets illustrates how the architecture mitigates risks (e.g., fraudulent listings and money laundering) through real-time AI anomaly detection and on-chain enforcement. Our evaluation and analysis suggest that combining AI governance with multi-agent systems and blockchain can significantly bolster trust in tokenized asset ecosystems. This work offers a novel framework for trustworthy asset tokenization on the web and provides insights for practitioners aiming to deploy secure, compliant tokenization platforms.

Abstract: Non Fungible Tokens have changed digital ownership and how creators earn money. Between 2021 and 2024, the market value exceeded 40 billion. However, the fast growth of the NFT ecosystem has revealed serious issues in managing intellectual property rights. There is a lot of confusion about the difference between owning an NFT and owning the copyright for the underlying content. This research looks at the gap between traditional copyright laws and blockchain-based transactions. We use a mixed methods approach to analyze this disconnect. We create a new IP rights matrix that clearly shows how copyright law relates to NFT ownership structures. Additionally, we include a business model taxonomy that sorts new commercial applications by their IP risk and sustainability factors. By examining important legal cases, smart contracts, and interviews with stakeholders, we find key problems in enforcing laws across different regions, standardizing licenses, and assessing business opportunities.

<title>Collaborative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Elastic Cloud Resource Scaling</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of rapid resource variation and highly uncertain task loads in cloud computing environments. It proposes an optimization method for elastic cloud resource scaling based on a multi-agent system. The method deploys multiple autonomous agents to perceive resource states in parallel and make local decisions. While maintaining the distributed nature of the system, it introduces a collaborative value function to achieve global coordination. This improves the responsiveness of resource scheduling and enhances overall system performance. To strengthen system foresight, a lightweight state prediction model is designed. It assists agents in identifying future workload trends and optimizes the selection of scaling actions. For policy training, the method adopts a centralized training and decentralized execution reinforcement learning framework. This enables agents to learn effectively and coordinate strategies under conditions of incomplete information. The paper also constructs typical cloud scenarios, including multi-tenancy and burst traffic, to evaluate the proposed method. The evaluation focuses on resource isolation, service quality assurance, and robustness. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-agent scaling strategy outperforms existing methods in resource utilization, SLA violation control, and scheduling latency. The results demonstrate strong adaptability and intelligent regulation. This provides an efficient and reliable new approach to solving the problem of elastic resource scaling in complex cloud platforms.

<title>Decentralized Pliable Index Coding For Federated Learning In Intelligent Transportation Systems</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning is a promising option for data privacy and security in ITS, because it allows edge devices, Road Side Units (RSUs), and Central Server (CS) to jointly train the machine learning model. Since RSU collects data from the vehicles passing through its range, the local data of each RSU will have a non-IID distribution, which adversely affects the convergence speed and accuracy of FL training. Generating synthetic data locally at individual nodes, followed by data shuffling among the nodes, is a promising approach to address the Non-IID data problem. In this work, we propose pliable index coding (PIC) solutions for efficient data shuffling among the nodes in an FL system. In PIC($S$) problems, a client is satisfied if it can retrieve any $S$ new messages not originally present in its side-information. We particularly consider decentralized pliable index coding problems (DPIC) where the clients communicate among themselves without a central server to model the data shuffling in FL. A class of DPIC, known as Consecutive Decentralized Pliable Index Coding (CDPIC($S$,$K$)), where each client has $K$ consecutive messages as side-information, is considered. For CDPIC($S$,$K$) problems, pliable index code designs are provided for any value of $K$ and $S$, and optimality proofs for some of the cases are established. Further, these CDPIC solutions are applied for data shuffling in FL, to transform the local data distribution towards IID progressively with each transmission, thereby enhancing the performance of FL. The improvement in the accuracy and convergence of the most popular FL technique, FedAvg, and a promising federated submodel technique, CELL (Communication Efficient Lottery Learning), are analysed by providing different degrees of data shuffling using the proposed CDPIC schemes.

<title>PANDAS: Peer-to-peer, Adaptive Networking for Data Availability Sampling within Ethereum Consensus Timebounds</title>

Abstract: Layer-2 protocols can assist Ethereum's limited throughput, but globally broadcasting layer-2 data limits their scalability. The Danksharding evolution of Ethereum aims to support the selective distribution of layer-2 data, whose availability in the network is verified using randomized data availability sampling (DAS). Integrating DAS into Ethereum's consensus process is challenging, as pieces of layer-2 data must be disseminated and sampled within four seconds of the beginning of each consensus slot. No existing solution can support dissemination and sampling under such strict time bounds.
  We propose PANDAS, a practical approach to integrate DAS with Ethereum under Danksharding's requirements without modifying its protocols for consensus and node discovery. PANDAS disseminates layer-2 data and samples its availability using lightweight, direct exchanges. Its design accounts for message loss, node failures, and unresponsive participants while anticipating the need to scale out the Ethereum network. Our evaluation of PANDAS's prototype in a 1,000-node cluster and simulations for up to 20,000 peers shows that it allows layer-2 data dissemination and sampling under planetary-scale latencies within the 4-second deadline.

Abstract: We study N-player finite games with costs perturbed due to time-varying disturbances in the underlying system and to that end, we propose the concept of Robust Correlated Equilibrium that generalizes the definition of Correlated Equilibrium. Conditions under which the Robust Correlated Equilibrium exists are specified, and a decentralized algorithm for learning strategies that are optimal in the sense of Robust Correlated Equilibrium is proposed. The primary contribution of the paper is the convergence analysis of the algorithm and to that end, we propose a modification of the celebrated Blackwell's Approachability theorem to games with costs that are not just time-average, as in the original Blackwell's Approachability Theorem, but also include the time-average of previous algorithm iterates. The designed algorithm is applied to a practical water distribution network with pumps being the controllers and their costs being perturbed by uncertain consumption due to the consumers. Simulation results show that each controller achieves no regret, and empirical distributions converge to the Robust Correlated Equilibrium.

Abstract: This paper reconceptualises peer review as structured public commentary. Traditional academic validation is hindered by anonymity, latency, and gatekeeping. We propose a transparent, identity-linked, and reproducible system of scholarly evaluation anchored in open commentary. Leveraging blockchain for immutable audit trails and AI for iterative synthesis, we design a framework that incentivises intellectual contribution, captures epistemic evolution, and enables traceable reputational dynamics. This model empowers fields from computational science to the humanities, reframing academic knowledge as a living process rather than a static credential.

<title>SABRE-FL: Selective and Accurate Backdoor Rejection for Federated Prompt Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning has emerged as a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving paradigm for adapting large vision-language models like CLIP across decentralized clients. However, the security implications of this setup remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first study of backdoor attacks in Federated Prompt Learning. We show that when malicious clients inject visually imperceptible, learnable noise triggers into input images, the global prompt learner becomes vulnerable to targeted misclassification while still maintaining high accuracy on clean inputs. Motivated by this vulnerability, we propose SABRE-FL, a lightweight, modular defense that filters poisoned prompt updates using an embedding-space anomaly detector trained offline on out-of-distribution data. SABRE-FL requires no access to raw client data or labels and generalizes across diverse datasets. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that malicious clients can be reliably identified and filtered using an embedding-based detector. Across five diverse datasets and four baseline defenses, SABRE-FL outperforms all baselines by significantly reducing backdoor accuracy while preserving clean accuracy, demonstrating strong empirical performance and underscoring the need for robust prompt learning in future federated systems.

Abstract: In the current paradigm of digital personalized services, the centralized management of personal data raises significant privacy concerns, security vulnerabilities, and diminished individual autonomy over sensitive information. Despite their efficiency, traditional centralized architectures frequently fail to satisfy rigorous privacy requirements and expose users to data breaches and unauthorized access risks. This pressing challenge calls for a fundamental paradigm shift in methodologies for collecting, storing, and utilizing personal data across diverse sectors, including education, healthcare, and finance.
  This paper introduces a novel decentralized, privacy-preserving architecture that handles heterogeneous personal information, ranging from educational credentials to health records and financial data. Unlike traditional models, our system grants users complete data ownership and control, allowing them to selectively share information without compromising privacy. The architecture's foundation comprises advanced privacy-enhancing technologies, including secure enclaves and federated learning, enabling secure computation, verification, and data sharing. The system supports diverse functionalities, including local computation, model training, and privacy-preserving data sharing, while ensuring data credibility and robust user privacy.

<title>FairMarket-RL: LLM-Guided Fairness Shaping for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Peer-to-Peer Markets</title>

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is increasingly recognized as a key mechanism for decentralized market regulation, yet existing approaches often lack robust frameworks to ensure fairness. This paper presents FairMarket-RL, a novel hybrid framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable fairness-aware trading agents. In a simulated P2P microgrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time fairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics: Fairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness scores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled {\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that replaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints. Agents are trained using Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and achieve equitable outcomes, fulfilling over 90% of buyer demand, maintaining fair seller margins, and consistently reaching FTB and FBS scores above 0.80. The training process demonstrates that fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer shortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers. With its language-based critic, the framework scales naturally, and its extension to a large power distribution system with household prosumers illustrates its practical applicability. FairMarket-RL thus offers a scalable, equity-driven solution for autonomous trading in decentralized energy systems.

<title>Trusted Routing for Blockchain-Enabled Low-Altitude Intelligent Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.22745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the scalability and portability, the low-altitude intelligent networks (LAINs) are essential in various fields such as surveillance and disaster rescue. However, in LAINs, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are characterized by the distributed topology and high dynamic mobility, and vulnerable to security threats, which may degrade the routing performance for data transmission. Hence, how to ensure the routing stability and security of LAINs is a challenge. In this paper, we focus on the routing process in LAINs with multiple UAV clusters and propose the blockchain-enabled zero-trust architecture to manage the joining and exiting of UAVs. Furthermore, we formulate the routing problem to minimize the end-to-end (E2E) delay, which is an integer linear programming and intractable to solve. Therefore, considering the distribution of LAINs, we reformulate the routing problem into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process. With the proposed soft hierarchical experience replay buffer, the multi-agent double deep Q-network based adaptive routing algorithm is designed. Finally, simulations are conducted and numerical results show that the total E2E delay of the proposed mechanism decreases by 22.38\% than the benchmark on average.

<title>Momentum-based Accelerated Algorithm for Distributed Optimization under Sector-Bound Nonlinearity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.22855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed optimization advances centralized machine learning methods by enabling parallel and decentralized learning processes over a network of computing nodes. This work provides an accelerated consensus-based distributed algorithm for locally non-convex optimization using the gradient-tracking technique. The proposed algorithm (i) improves the convergence rate by adding momentum towards the optimal state using the heavy-ball method, while (ii) addressing general sector-bound nonlinearities over the information-sharing network. The link nonlinearity includes any sign-preserving odd sector-bound mapping, for example, log-scale data quantization or clipping in practical applications. For admissible momentum and gradient-tracking parameters, using perturbation theory and eigen-spectrum analysis, we prove convergence even in the presence of sector-bound nonlinearity and for locally non-convex cost functions. Further, in contrast to most existing weight-stochastic algorithms, we adopt weight-balanced (WB) network design. This WB design and perturbation-based analysis allow to handle dynamic directed network of agents to address possible time-varying setups due to link failures or packet drops.

<title>Hierarchical Decentralized Stochastic Control for Cyber-Physical Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.22971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized architecture for control of Cyber-Physical Systems. The architecture consists of $N$ independent sub-processes, a global controller, and $N$ local controllers, each formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The global controller, operating at a slower timescale optimizes the infinite-horizon discounted cumulative reward under budget constraints. For the local controllers, operating at a faster timescale, we propose two different optimization frameworks, namely the COpt and FOpt. In the COpt framework, the local controller also optimizes an infinite-horizon MDP, while in the FOpt framework, the local controller optimizes a finite-horizon MDP. The FOpt framework mimics a federal structure, where the local controllers have more autonomy in their decision making. First, the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for both these frameworks is established. Then, various relationships between the two frameworks are studied, including a bound on the difference between the two optimal value functions. Additionally, sufficiency conditions are provided such that the two frameworks lead to the same optimal values.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) is transforming traditional power grid networks, which require new approaches for managing decentralized energy production and consumption. Microgrids (MGs) provide a promising solution by enabling localized control over energy generation, storage, and distribution. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based methodology for optimizing microgrid energy management. Specifically, we propose an RL agent that learns optimal energy trading and storage policies by leveraging historical data on energy production, consumption, and market prices. A digital twin (DT) is used to simulate the energy storage system dynamics, incorporating degradation factors to ensure a realistic emulation of the analysed setting. Our approach is validated through an experimental campaign using real-world data from a power grid located in the Italian territory. The results indicate that the proposed RL-based strategy outperforms rule-based methods and existing RL benchmarks, offering a robust solution for intelligent microgrid management.

Abstract: FastSet is an actor-based distributed protocol for decentralized finance and settlement, which is inspired from blockchains. Account holders cooperate by making claims, which can include payments, holding and transferring assets, accessing and updating shared data, medical records, digital identity, and mathematical theorems, among many others. The claims are signed by their owners and are broadcast to a decentralized network of validators, which validate and settle them. Validators replicate the global state of the accounts and need not communicate with each other. In sharp contrast to blockchains, strong consistency is purposely given up as a requirement. Yet, many if not most of the blockchain benefits are preserved. The protocol is proved to be correct, despite its massively parallel nature.

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a common abstraction of multi-robot trajectory planning problems, where multiple homogeneous robots simultaneously move in the shared environment. While solving MAPF optimally has been proven to be NP-hard, scalable, and efficient, solvers are vital for real-world applications like logistics, search-and-rescue, etc. To this end, decentralized suboptimal MAPF solvers that leverage machine learning have come on stage. Building on the success of the recently introduced MAPF-GPT, a pure imitation learning solver, we introduce MAPF-GPT-DDG. This novel approach effectively fine-tunes the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. Leveraging a novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training while significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments demonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF solvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across many testing scenarios. Remarkably, it can work with MAPF instances involving up to 1 million agents in a single environment, setting a new milestone for scalability in MAPF domains.

<title>FedCLAM: Client Adaptive Momentum with Foreground Intensity Matching for Federated Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized training approach that keeps data under stakeholder control while achieving superior performance over isolated training. While inter-institutional feature discrepancies pose a challenge in all federated settings, medical imaging is particularly affected due to diverse imaging devices and population variances, which can diminish the global model's effectiveness. Existing aggregation methods generally fail to adapt across varied circumstances. To address this, we propose FedCLAM, which integrates \textit{client-adaptive momentum} terms derived from each client's loss reduction during local training, as well as a \textit{personalized dampening factor} to curb overfitting. We further introduce a novel \textit{intensity alignment} loss that matches predicted and ground-truth foreground distributions to handle heterogeneous image intensity profiles across institutions and devices. Extensive evaluations on two datasets show that FedCLAM surpasses eight cutting-edge methods in medical segmentation tasks, underscoring its efficacy. The code is available at https://github.com/siomvas/FedCLAM.

<title>Fair Data Exchange at Near-Plaintext Efficiency</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.14944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fair Data Exchange (FDE) protocol (CCS '24) provides atomic pay-per-file transfers with constant-size proofs, yet existing implementations remain unscalably slow (about 1 second per 4 KiB) and inflate ciphertexts by 10--50x. We introduce an FDE implementation that achieves near-plaintext speeds and sizes, making fair exchange practical even for gigabyte-scale files.
  Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we observe that a KZG commitment to polynomial evaluations implicitly (and without modification) also binds to the Reed--Solomon (RS) codeword of its coefficients, enabling sound and efficient randomized verification. Second, while heavyweight encryption schemes such as exponential ElGamal enable compact proofs linking ciphertexts to the commitment, they are unnecessary for direct data recovery.
  Exploiting these insights, we apply a lightweight hash-derived mask to the entire RS-extended codeword, and perform ElGamal encryption only on a pseudorandom \Theta(lambda) subset of symbols, where lambda is the security parameter (e.g., 128). Data recovery occurs by simply removing the lightweight masks, with ElGamal ciphertexts serving exclusively for verification proofs. A heavyweight (but constant-time) zk-SNARK ensures consistency between these two encryption layers at sampled positions, sharply reducing bandwidth overhead and computational cost.
  In addition, we show how a constant-time (and precomputable) zk-SNARK linking a BLS12-381 secret key to a secp256k1 hash pre-image resolves Bitcoin's elliptic-curve mismatch, enabling fully off-chain execution via the Lightning Network. This can reduce transaction fees from roughly $10 to under $0.01 and shortens transaction latency from tens of seconds on Ethereum down to about a second or less.

Abstract: Hitchhiking, a spontaneous and decentralized mode of travel, has long eluded systematic study due to its informal nature. This paper presents and analyzes the largest known structured dataset of hitchhiking rides, comprising over 63,000 entries collected over nearly two decades through platforms associated with hitchwiki.org and lately on hitchmap.com. By leveraging crowd-sourced contributions, the dataset captures key spatiotemporal and strategic aspects of hitchhiking. This work documents the dataset's origins, evolution, and community-driven maintenance, highlighting its Europe-centric distribution, seasonal patterns, and reliance on a small number of highly active contributors. Through exploratory analyses, I examine waiting times, user behavior, and comment metadata, shedding light on the lived realities of hitchhikers. While the dataset has inherent biases and limitations - such as demographic skew and unverifiable entries it offers a rare and valuable window into an alternative form of mobility. I conclude by outlining future directions for enriching the dataset and advancing research on hitchhiking as both a transportation practice and cultural phenomenon.

Abstract: With the increasing multimodal knowledge privatization requirements, multimodal knowledge graphs in different institutes are usually decentralized, lacking of effective collaboration system with both stronger reasoning ability and transmission safety guarantees. In this paper, we propose the Federated Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (FedMKGC) task, aiming at training over federated MKGs for better predicting the missing links in clients without sharing sensitive knowledge. We propose a framework named MMFeD3-HidE for addressing multimodal uncertain unavailability and multimodal client heterogeneity challenges of FedMKGC. (1) Inside the clients, our proposed Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding model (HidE) recovers the complete multimodal distributions from incomplete entity embeddings constrained by available modalities. (2) Among clients, our proposed Multimodal FeDerated Dual Distillation (MMFeD3) transfers knowledge mutually between clients and the server with logit and feature distillation to improve both global convergence and semantic consistency. We propose a FedMKGC benchmark for a comprehensive evaluation, consisting of a general FedMKGC backbone named MMFedE, datasets with heterogeneous multimodal information, and three groups of constructed baselines. Experiments conducted on our benchmark validate the effectiveness, semantic consistency, and convergence robustness of MMFeD3-HidE.

Abstract: The volatility and complex dynamics of cryptocurrency markets present unique challenges for accurate price forecasting. This research proposes a hybrid deep learning and machine learning model that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for cryptocurrency price prediction. The LSTM component captures temporal dependencies in historical price data, while XGBoost enhances prediction by modeling nonlinear relationships with auxiliary features such as sentiment scores and macroeconomic indicators. The model is evaluated on historical datasets of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Litecoin, incorporating both global and localized exchange data. Comparative analysis using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Min-Max Normalized Root Mean Square Error (MinMax RMSE) demonstrates that the LSTM+XGBoost hybrid consistently outperforms standalone models and traditional forecasting methods. This study underscores the potential of hybrid architectures in financial forecasting and provides insights into model adaptability across different cryptocurrencies and market contexts.

Abstract: Current blockchain protocols (e.g., Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake) secure the ledger yet cannot measure validator trustworthiness, allowing subtle misconduct that is especially damaging in decentralized-finance (DeFi) settings. We introduce Proof-of-Behavior (PoB), a consensus model that (i) gives each action a layered utility score -- covering motivation and outcome, (ii) adapts validator weights using recent scores, and (iii) applies decentralized verification with proportional slashing. The reward design is incentive-compatible, yielding a Nash equilibrium in which honest behavior maximizes long-run pay-offs. Simulated DeFi experiments (loan-fraud detection, reputation-weighted validation) show that PoB cuts fraud acceptance by more than 90%, demotes malicious validators within two rounds, and improves proposer fairness versus standard PoS, all with no more than a 5% throughput overhead. By linking consensus influence to verifiably trustworthy conduct, PoB offers a scalable, regulation-friendly foundation for secure and fair blockchain governance in financial applications.

Abstract: The industrial market continuously needs reliable solutions to secure autonomous systems. Especially as these systems become more complex and interconnected, reliable security solutions are becoming increasingly important. One promising solution to tackle this challenge is using smart contracts designed to meet contractual conditions, avoid malicious errors, secure exchanges, and minimize the need for reliable intermediaries. However, smart contracts are immutable. Moreover, there are different smart contract execution architectures (namely Order-Execute and Execute-Order-Validate) that have different throughputs. In this study, we developed an evaluation model for assessing the security of reliable smart contract execution. We then developed a realistic smart contract enabled IoT energy case study. Finally, we simulate the developed case study to evaluate several smart contract security vulnerabilities reported in the literature. Our results show that the Execute-Order-Validate architecture is more promising regarding reliability and security.

Abstract: The rapid rise of open-weight and open-source foundation models is intensifying the obligation and reshaping the opportunity to make AI systems safe. This paper reports outcomes from the Columbia Convening on AI Openness and Safety (San Francisco, 19 Nov 2024) and its six-week preparatory programme involving more than forty-five researchers, engineers, and policy leaders from academia, industry, civil society, and government. Using a participatory, solutions-oriented process, the working groups produced (i) a research agenda at the intersection of safety and open source AI; (ii) a mapping of existing and needed technical interventions and open source tools to safely and responsibly deploy open foundation models across the AI development workflow; and (iii) a mapping of the content safety filter ecosystem with a proposed roadmap for future research and development. We find that openness -- understood as transparent weights, interoperable tooling, and public governance -- can enhance safety by enabling independent scrutiny, decentralized mitigation, and culturally plural oversight. However, significant gaps persist: scarce multimodal and multilingual benchmarks, limited defenses against prompt-injection and compositional attacks in agentic systems, and insufficient participatory mechanisms for communities most affected by AI harms. The paper concludes with a roadmap of five priority research directions, emphasizing participatory inputs, future-proof content filters, ecosystem-wide safety infrastructure, rigorous agentic safeguards, and expanded harm taxonomies. These recommendations informed the February 2025 French AI Action Summit and lay groundwork for an open, plural, and accountable AI safety discipline.

Our framework offers practical, industry-ready solutions for maintaining robust and secure microservices. Practitioners and researchers can customize the framework to enhance system stability, reduce downtime, and monitor broader system quality attributes such as system performance level, resilience, security, and anomaly management, among others.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into health and biomedical systems necessitates robust frameworks for transparency, accountability, and ethical compliance. Existing frameworks often rely on human-readable, manual documentation which limits scalability, comparability, and machine interpretability across projects and platforms. They also fail to provide a unique, verifiable identity for AI models to ensure their provenance and authenticity across systems and use cases, limiting reproducibility and stakeholder trust. This paper introduces the concept of the AI Model Passport, a structured and standardized documentation framework that acts as a digital identity and verification tool for AI models. It captures essential metadata to uniquely identify, verify, trace and monitor AI models across their lifecycle - from data acquisition and preprocessing to model design, development and deployment. In addition, an implementation of this framework is presented through AIPassport, an MLOps tool developed within the ProCAncer-I EU project for medical imaging applications. AIPassport automates metadata collection, ensures proper versioning, decouples results from source scripts, and integrates with various development environments. Its effectiveness is showcased through a lesion segmentation use case using data from the ProCAncer-I dataset, illustrating how the AI Model Passport enhances transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory readiness while reducing manual effort. This approach aims to set a new standard for fostering trust and accountability in AI-driven healthcare solutions, aspiring to serve as the basis for developing transparent and regulation compliant AI systems across domains.

<title>Sheaf-Based Decentralized Multimodal Learning for Next-Generation Wireless Communication Systems</title>

Abstract: In large-scale communication systems, increasingly complex scenarios require more intelligent collaboration among edge devices collecting various multimodal sensory data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment and improve decision-making accuracy. However, conventional federated learning (FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities. Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att, which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.

Abstract: We propose \textit{OpenAlpha}, a community-led strategy validation framework for decentralised capital management on a host blockchain network, which integrates game-theoretic validation, adversarial auditing, and market-based belief aggregation. This work formulates treasury deployment as a capital optimisation problem under verification costs and strategic misreporting, and operationalises it through a decision waterfall that sequences intention declaration, strategy proposal, prediction-market validation, dispute resolution, and capital allocation. Each phase of this framework's validation process embeds economic incentives to align proposer, verifier, and auditor behaviour, producing confidence scores that may feed into a capital allocation rule. While OpenAlpha is designed for capital strategy assessment, its validation mechanisms are composable and extend naturally to evaluating external decentralised applications (DApps), enabling on-chain scrutiny of DApp performance, reliability, and integration risk. This architecture allows for adaptive, trust-minimised capital deployment without reliance on centralised governance or static audits.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for learning from decentralized data in privacy-constrained scenarios.However, system and statistical challenges hinder its real-world applicability, requiring efficient learning from edge devices and robustness to data heterogeneity. Despite significant research efforts, existing approaches often degrade severely due to the joint effect of heterogeneity and partial client participation. In particular, while momentum appears as a promising approach for overcoming statistical heterogeneity, in current approaches its update is biased towards the most recently sampled clients. As we show in this work, this is the reason why it fails to outperform FedAvg, preventing its effective use in real-world large-scale scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel Generalized Heavy-Ball Momentum (GHBM) and theoretically prove it enables convergence under unbounded data heterogeneity in cyclic partial participation, thereby advancing the understanding of momentum's effectiveness in FL. We then introduce adaptive and communication-efficient variants of GHBM that match the communication complexity of FedAvg in settings where clients can be stateful. Extensive experiments on vision and language tasks confirm our theoretical findings, demonstrating that GHBM substantially improves state-of-the-art performance under random uniform client sampling, particularly in large-scale settings with high data heterogeneity and low client participation. Code is available at https://rickzack.github.io/GHBM.

Abstract: \textit{DPLib} is an open-source MATLAB-based benchmark library created to support research and development in distributed and decentralized power system analysis and optimization. Distributed and decentralized methods offer scalability, privacy preservation, and resilience to single points of failure, making them increasingly important for modern power systems. However, unlike centralized tools such as MATPOWER, no general-purpose, reproducible data library package currently exists for distributed power system studies. DPLib fills this gap by providing a standard power system library featuring over 20 multi-region benchmark test cases of varying sizes, along with a graph-based partitioning toolkit that decomposes any MATPOWER test system into multiple electrically coherent regions. The partitioning toolkit, an easy-to-use MATLAB code, generates standardized \texttt{.mat} and \texttt{.m} files, along with region visualizations for intuitive understanding. We also provide modular, easy-to-use distributed optimal power flow (OPF) solvers: an alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM)-based DC-OPF solver implemented in YALMIP, and an ADMM-based AC-OPF solver leveraging IPOPT. These solvers validate the generated test systems for distributed optimization applications. Numerical results validate the generated test cases, establishing DPLib as a foundation for reproducible distributed power system research.

<title>BLOCKS: Blockchain-supported Cross-Silo Knowledge Sharing for Efficient LLM Services</title>

Abstract: The hallucination problem of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly drawn attention. Augmenting LLMs with external knowledge is a promising solution to address this issue. However, due to privacy and security concerns, a vast amount of downstream task-related knowledge remains dispersed and isolated across various "silos," making it difficult to access. To bridge this knowledge gap, we propose a blockchain-based external knowledge framework that coordinates multiple knowledge silos to provide reliable foundational knowledge for large model retrieval while ensuring data security. Technically, we distill knowledge from local data into prompts and execute transactions and records on the blockchain. Additionally, we introduce a reputation mechanism and cross-validation to ensure knowledge quality and provide incentives for participation. Furthermore, we design a query generation framework that provides a direct API interface for large model retrieval. To evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on various knowledge sources. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves efficient LLM service knowledge sharing in blockchain environments.

Abstract: The advent of 5G and beyond has brought increased performance networks, facilitating the deployment of services closer to the user. To meet performance requirements such services require specialized hardware, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). However, FPGAs are often deployed in unprotected environments, leaving the user's applications vulnerable to multiple attacks. With the rise of quantum computing, which threatens the integrity of widely-used cryptographic algorithms, the need for a robust security infrastructure is even more crucial. In this paper we introduce a hybrid hardware-software solution utilizing remote attestation to securely configure FPGAs, while integrating Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) algorithms for enhanced security. Additionally, to enable trustworthiness across the whole edge computing continuum, our solution integrates a blockchain infrastructure, ensuring the secure storage of any security evidence. We evaluate the proposed secure configuration process under different PQC algorithms in two FPGA families, showcasing only 2% overheard compared to the non PQC approach.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC. Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects. Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100 billion parameters.

<title>Enabling Bitcoin Smart Contracts on the Internet Computer</title>

Abstract: There is growing interest in providing programmatic access to the value locked in Bitcoin, which famously offers limited programmability itself. Various approaches have been put forth in recent years, with the vast majority of proposed mechanisms either building new functionality on top of Bitcoin or leveraging a bridging mechanism to enable smart contracts that make use of ``wrapped'' bitcoins on entirely different platforms.
  In this work, an architecture is presented that follows a different approach. The architecture enables the execution of Turing-complete Bitcoin smart contracts on the Internet Computer (IC), a blockchain platform for hosting and executing decentralized applications. Instead of using a bridge, IC and Bitcoin nodes interact directly, eliminating potential security risks that the use of a bridge entails. This integration requires novel concepts, in particular to reconcile the probabilistic nature of Bitcoin with the irreversibility of finalized state changes on the IC, which may be of independent interest.
  In addition to the presentation of the architecture, we provide evaluation results based on measurements of the Bitcoin integration running on mainnet. The evaluation results demonstrate that, with finalization in a few seconds and low execution costs, this integration enables complex Bitcoin-based decentralized applications that were not practically feasible or economically viable before.

<title>Rational Miner Behaviour, Protocol Stability, and Time Preference: An Austrian and Game-Theoretic Analysis of Bitcoin's Incentive Environment</title>

Abstract: This paper integrates Austrian capital theory with repeated game theory to examine strategic miner behaviour under different institutional conditions in blockchain systems. It shows that when protocol rules are mutable, effective time preference rises, undermining rational long-term planning and cooperative equilibria. Using formal game-theoretic analysis and Austrian economic principles, the paper demonstrates how mutable protocols shift miner incentives from productive investment to political rent-seeking and influence games. The original Bitcoin protocol is interpreted as an institutional anchor: a fixed rule-set enabling calculability and low time preference. Drawing on the work of Bohm-Bawerk, Mises, and Hayek, the argument is made that protocol immutability is essential for restoring strategic coherence, entrepreneurial confidence, and sustainable network equilibrium.

arXiv:2506.20992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a formal game-theoretic model to examine how protocol mutability disrupts cooperative mining behaviour in blockchain systems. Using a repeated game framework with stochastic rule shocks, we show that even minor uncertainty in institutional rules increases time preference and induces strategic deviation. Fixed-rule environments support long-term investment and stable equilibrium strategies; in contrast, mutable protocols lead to short-termism, higher discounting, and collapse of coordinated engagement. Simulation results identify instability zones in the parameter space where rational mining gives way to extractive or arbitrage conduct. These findings support an Austrian economic interpretation: calculability requires rule stability. Institutional noise undermines the informational basis for productive action. We conclude that protocol design must be treated as a constitutional economic constraint, not a discretionary variable, if sustainable cooperation is to emerge in decentralised systems.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating within Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs) encounter security challenges due to the dynamic and distributed nature of these networks. Previous studies focused predominantly on centralized intrusion detection, assuming a central entity responsible for storing and analyzing data from all devices. However, these approaches face challenges including computation and storage costs, along with a single point of failure risk, threatening data privacy and availability. The widespread dispersion of data across interconnected devices underscores the need for decentralized approaches. This paper introduces the Federated Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (FL-IDS), addressing challenges encountered by centralized systems in FANETs. FL-IDS reduces computation and storage costs for both clients and the central server, which is crucial for resource-constrained UAVs. Operating in a decentralized manner, FL-IDS enables UAVs to collaboratively train a global intrusion detection model without sharing raw data, thus avoiding delay in decisions based on collected data, as is often the case with traditional methods. Experimental results demonstrate FL-IDS's competitive performance with Central IDS (C-IDS) while mitigating privacy concerns, with the Bias Towards Specific Clients (BTSC) method further enhancing FL-IDS performance even at lower attacker ratios. Comparative analysis with traditional intrusion detection methods, including Local IDS (L-IDS), sheds light on the strengths of FL-IDS. This study significantly contributes to UAV security by introducing a privacy-aware, decentralized intrusion detection approach tailored to UAV networks. Moreover, by introducing a realistic dataset for FANETs and federated learning, our approach differs from others lacking high dynamism and 3D node movements or accurate federated data federations.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer trading and the move to decentralized grids have reshaped the energy markets in the United States. Notwithstanding, such developments lead to new challenges, mainly regarding the safety and authenticity of energy trade. This study aimed to develop and build a secure, intelligent, and efficient energy transaction system for the decentralized US energy market. This research interlinks the technological prowess of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) in a novel way to solve long-standing challenges in the distributed energy market, specifically those of security, fraudulent behavior detection, and market reliability. The dataset for this research is comprised of more than 1.2 million anonymized energy transaction records from a simulated peer-to-peer (P2P) energy exchange network emulating real-life blockchain-based American microgrids, including those tested by LO3 Energy and Grid+ Labs. Each record contains detailed fields of transaction identifier, timestamp, energy volume (kWh), transaction type (buy/sell), unit price, prosumer/consumer identifier (hashed for privacy), smart meter readings, geolocation regions, and settlement confirmation status. The dataset also includes system-calculated behavior metrics of transaction rate, variability of energy production, and historical pricing patterns. The system architecture proposed involves the integration of two layers, namely a blockchain layer and artificial intelligence (AI) layer, each playing a unique but complementary function in energy transaction securing and market intelligence improvement. The machine learning models used in this research were specifically chosen for their established high performance in classification tasks, specifically in the identification of energy transaction fraud in decentralized markets.

arXiv:2506.19892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables nodes to collaboratively train models without a central server, introducing new vulnerabilities since each node independently selects peers for model aggregation. Malicious nodes may exploit this autonomy by sending corrupted models (model poisoning), delaying model submissions (delay attack), or flooding the network with excessive messages, negatively affecting system performance. Existing solutions often depend on rigid configurations or additional infrastructures such as blockchain, leading to computational overhead, scalability issues, or limited adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes RepuNet, a decentralized reputation system that categorizes threats in DFL and dynamically evaluates node behavior using metrics like model similarity, parameter changes, message latency, and communication volume. Nodes' influence in model aggregation is adjusted based on their reputation scores. RepuNet was integrated into the Nebula DFL platform and experimentally evaluated with MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets under non-IID distributions, using federations of up to 25 nodes in both fully connected and random topologies. Different attack intensities, frequencies, and activation intervals were tested. Results demonstrated that RepuNet effectively detects and mitigates malicious behavior, achieving F1 scores above 95% for MNIST scenarios and approximately 76% for CIFAR-10 cases. These outcomes highlight RepuNet's adaptability, robustness, and practical potential for mitigating threats in decentralized federated learning environments.

Abstract: The detection of malicious accounts on Ethereum - the preeminent DeFi platform - is critical for protecting digital assets and maintaining trust in decentralized finance. Recent advances highlight that temporal transaction evolution reveals more attack signatures than static graphs. However, current methods either fail to model continuous transaction dynamics or incur high computational costs that limit scalability to large-scale transaction networks. Furthermore, current methods fail to consider two higher-order behavioral fingerprints: (1) direction in temporal transaction flows, which encodes money movement trajectories, and (2) account clustering, which reveals coordinated behavior of organized malicious collectives. To address these challenges, we propose DiT-SGCR, an unsupervised graph encoder for malicious account detection. Specifically, DiT-SGCR employs directional temporal aggregation to capture dynamic account interactions, then coupled with differentiable clustering and graph Laplacian regularization to generate high-quality, low-dimensional embeddings. Our approach simultaneously encodes directional temporal dynamics, global topology, and cluster-specific behavioral patterns, thereby enhancing the discriminability and robustness of account representations. Furthermore, DiT-SGCR bypasses conventional graph propagation mechanisms, yielding significant scalability advantages. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that DiT-SGCR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks, achieving F1-score improvements ranging from 3.62% to 10.83%.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative machine learning (ML) technique. It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands and data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL is handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data. Current solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or customizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a well-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time. Additionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from introducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data leakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation framework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD). Specifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic data. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their parameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional distillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions so that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show that FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.

Abstract: The growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has intensified the need for personalized learning methods that can operate efficiently and privately across heterogeneous, resource-constrained devices. However, enabling effective personalized learning in decentralized settings introduces several challenges, including efficient knowledge transfer between clients, protection of data privacy, and resilience against poisoning attacks. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing P4 (Personalized, Private, Peer-to-Peer) -- a method designed to deliver personalized models for resource-constrained IoT devices while ensuring differential privacy and robustness against poisoning attacks. Our solution employs a lightweight, fully decentralized algorithm to privately detect client similarity and form collaborative groups. Within each group, clients leverage differentially private knowledge distillation to co-train their models, maintaining high accuracy while ensuring robustness to the presence of malicious clients. We evaluate P4 on popular benchmark datasets using both linear and CNN-based architectures across various heterogeneity settings and attack scenarios. Experimental results show that P4 achieves 5% to 30% higher accuracy than leading differentially private peer-to-peer approaches and maintains robustness with up to 30% malicious clients. Additionally, we demonstrate its practicality by deploying it on resource-constrained devices, where collaborative training between two clients adds only ~7 seconds of overhead.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative Machine Learning framework for training models without collecting data in a centralized location. It has seen application across various disciplines, from helping medical diagnoses in hospitals to detecting fraud in financial transactions. In this paper, we focus on improving the local training process through hardware usage optimization. While participants in a federation might share the hardware they are training on, since there is no information exchange between them, their training process can be hindered by an improper training configuration. Taking advantage of the parallel processing inherent to Federated Learning, we use a greedy randomized search to optimize local batch sizes for the best training settings across all participants. Our results show that against default parameter settings, our method improves convergence speed while staying nearly on par with the case where local parameters are optimized.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm which allows participants to collectively train a model while training data remains private. This paradigm is especially beneficial for sectors like finance, where data privacy, security and model performance are paramount. FL has been extensively studied in the years following its introduction, leading to, among others, better performing collaboration techniques, ways to defend against other clients trying to attack the model, and contribution assessment methods. An important element in for-profit Federated Learning is the development of incentive methods to determine the allocation and distribution of rewards for participants. While numerous methods for allocation have been proposed and thoroughly explored, distribution frameworks remain relatively understudied. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which introduces client-specific tokens as investment vehicles within the FL ecosystem. Our framework aims to address the limitations of existing incentive schemes by leveraging a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform and automated market makers (AMMs) to create a more flexible and scalable reward distribution system for participants, and a mechanism for third parties to invest in the federation learning process.

Abstract: We consider the problem of encoding information in a system of N=K+R processors that operate in a decentralized manner, i.e., without a central processor which orchestrates the operation. The system involves K source processors, each holding some data modeled as a vector over a finite field. The remaining R processors are sinks, and each of which requires a linear combination of all data vectors. These linear combinations are distinct from one sink processor to another, and are specified by a generator matrix of a systematic linear error correcting code. To capture the communication cost of decentralized encoding, we adopt a linear network model in which the process proceeds in consecutive communication rounds. In every round, every processor sends and receives one message through each one of its p ports. Moreover, inspired by linear network coding literature, we allow processors to transfer linear combinations of their own data and previously received data. We propose a framework that addresses the decentralized encoding problem on two levels. On the universal level, we provide a solution to the decentralized encoding problem for any possible linear code. On the specific level, we further optimize our solution towards systematic Reed-Solomon codes, as well as their variant, Lagrange codes, for their prevalent use in coded storage and computation systems. Our solutions are based on a newly-defined collective communication operation we call all-to-all encode.

Abstract: Driven by the vision of ubiquitous connectivity and wireless intelligence, the evolution of ultra-dense constellation-based satellite-integrated Internet is underway, now taking preliminary shape. Nevertheless, the entrenched institutional silos and limited, nonrenewable heterogeneous network resources leave current satellite systems struggling to accommodate the escalating demands of next-generation intelligent applications. In this context, the distributed satellite information networks (DSIN), exemplified by the cohesive clustered satellites system, have emerged as an innovative architecture, bridging information gaps across diverse satellite systems, such as communication, navigation, and remote sensing, and establishing a unified, open information network paradigm to support resilient space information services. This survey first provides a profound discussion about innovative network architectures of DSIN, encompassing distributed regenerative satellite network architecture, distributed satellite computing network architecture, and reconfigurable satellite formation flying, to enable flexible and scalable communication, computing and control. The DSIN faces challenges from network heterogeneity, unpredictable channel dynamics, sparse resources, and decentralized collaboration frameworks. To address these issues, a series of enabling technologies is identified, including channel modeling and estimation, cloud-native distributed MIMO cooperation, grant-free massive access, network routing, and the proper combination of all these diversity techniques. Furthermore, to heighten the overall resource efficiency, the cross-layer optimization techniques are further developed to meet upper-layer deterministic, adaptive and secure information services requirements. In addition, emerging research directions and new opportunities are highlighted on the way to achieving the DSIN vision.

Abstract: AI Data Readiness Inspector (AIDRIN) is a framework to evaluate and improve data preparedness for AI applications. It addresses critical data readiness dimensions such as data quality, bias, fairness, and privacy. This paper details enhancements to AIDRIN by focusing on user interface improvements and integration with a privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) framework. By refining the UI and enabling smooth integration with decentralized AI pipelines, AIDRIN becomes more accessible and practical for users with varying technical expertise. Integrating with an existing PPFL framework ensures that data readiness and privacy are prioritized in federated learning environments. A case study involving a real-world dataset demonstrates AIDRIN's practical value in identifying data readiness issues that impact AI model performance.

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI, data-intensive science, and digital twin technologies has driven an unprecedented demand for high-performance computing (HPC) across the research ecosystem. While national laboratories and industrial hyperscalers have invested heavily in exascale and GPU-centric architectures, university-operated HPC systems remain comparatively under-resourced. This survey presents a comprehensive assessment of the HPC landscape across U.S. universities, benchmarking their capabilities against Department of Energy (DOE) leadership-class systems and industrial AI infrastructures. We examine over 50 premier research institutions, analyzing compute capacity, architectural design, governance models, and energy efficiency. Our findings reveal that university clusters, though vital for academic research, exhibit significantly lower growth trajectories (CAGR $\approx$ 18%) than their national ($\approx$ 43%) and industrial ($\approx$ 78%) counterparts. The increasing skew toward GPU-dense AI workloads has widened the capability gap, highlighting the need for federated computing, idle-GPU harvesting, and cost-sharing models. We also identify emerging paradigms, such as decentralized reinforcement learning, as promising opportunities for democratizing AI training within campus environments. Ultimately, this work provides actionable insights for academic leaders, funding agencies, and technology partners to ensure more equitable and sustainable HPC access in support of national research priorities.

Abstract: The YulCode dataset presents a comprehensive collection of 348,840 Yul-based smart contract instances, comprising approximately 135,013 unique contracts. These contracts were generated through the compilation of Solidity source files that have been deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, making the dataset directly representative of real-world decentralized applications. YulCode provides a rich foundation for a variety of research and development tasks, including but not limited to machine learning applications, formal verification, optimization analysis, and software engineering tool evaluation in the context of low-level smart contract code. To the best of our knowledge at the time of writing, YulCode is the first and only publicly available dataset that focuses specifically on Yul, an intermediate language designed for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). As such, it fills a critical gap in the current ecosystem of smart contract datasets and opens new avenues for research and tooling aimed at low-level contract analysis and generation.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has created an unprecedented demand for fine-tuning models for specialized domains, such as medical science. While federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and privacy-preserving approach to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without sharing raw data, it presents significant challenges, particularly in performance and managing large model sizes efficiently. In this paper, we introduce GradualDiff-Fed, an FL framework designed explicitly for LLMs, and their challenge of handling the high parameter size. GradualDiff-Fed reduces communication costs by transmitting only the difference of model weights rather than the entire model during training rounds. Such an approach significantly improves scalability and communication efficiency, making it more feasible to fine-tune LLMs across distributed clients without compromising performance. Our evaluation demonstrates that GradualDiff-Fed achieves performance on par with centralized training while drastically reducing communication overhead. These results highlight the potential of GradualDiff-Fed as an efficient solution for fine-tuning large models from distributed data in privacy-preserving settings without comprising performance.

Abstract: Existing decentralized storage protocols fall short of the service required by real-world applications. Their throughput, latency, cost-effectiveness, and availability are insufficient for demanding workloads such as video streaming, large-scale data analytics, or AI training. As a result, Web3 data-intensive applications are predominantly dependent on centralized infrastructure.
  Shelby is a high-performance decentralized storage protocol designed to meet demanding needs. It achieves fast, reliable access to large volumes of data while preserving decentralization guarantees. The architecture reflects lessons from Web2 systems: it separates control and data planes, uses erasure coding with low replication overhead and minimal repair bandwidth, and operates over a dedicated backbone connecting RPC and storage nodes. Reads are paid, which incentivizes good performance. Shelby also introduces a novel auditing protocol that provides strong cryptoeconomic guarantees without compromising performance, a common limitation of other decentralized solutions. The result is a decentralized system that brings Web2-grade performance to production-scale, read-intensive Web3 applications.

Abstract: Data trading is one of the key focuses of Web 3.0. However, all the current methods that rely on blockchain-based smart contracts for data exchange cannot support large-scale data trading while ensuring data security, which falls short of fulfilling the spirit of Web 3.0. Even worse, there is currently a lack of discussion on the essential properties that large-scale data trading should satisfy. In this work, we are the first to formalize the property requirements for enabling data trading in Web 3.0. Based on these requirements, we are the first to propose Yotta, a complete batch data trading scheme for blockchain, which features a data trading design that leverages our innovative cryptographic workflow with IPFS and zk-SNARK. Our simulation results demonstrate that Yotta outperforms baseline approaches up to 130 times and exhibits excellent scalability to satisfy all the properties.

Abstract: The global energy transition towards distributed, smaller-scale resources, such as decentralized generation and flexible assets like storage and shiftable loads, demands novel control structures aligned with the emerging network architectures. These architectures consist of interconnected, self-contained clusters, commonly called microgrids or energy communities. These clusters aim to optimize collective self-sufficiency by prioritizing local energy use or operating independently during wide-area blackouts. This study addresses the challenge of defining optimal clusters, framed as a community detection problem. A novel metric, termed energy modularity, is proposed to evaluate community partitions by quantifying energy self-sufficiency within clusters while incorporating the influence of flexible resources. Furthermore, a highly scalable community detection algorithm to maximize energy modularity based on the Louvain method is presented. Therefore, energy modularity is calculated using linear programming or a more efficient simulation-based approach. The algorithm is validated on an exemplary benchmark grid, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying optimal energy clusters for modern decentralized energy systems.

<title>PhishingHook: Catching Phishing Ethereum Smart Contracts leveraging EVM Opcodes</title>

Abstract: The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a decentralized computing engine. It enables the Ethereum blockchain to execute smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). The increasing adoption of Ethereum sparked the rise of phishing activities. Phishing attacks often target users through deceptive means, e.g., fake websites, wallet scams, or malicious smart contracts, aiming to steal sensitive information or funds. A timely detection of phishing activities in the EVM is therefore crucial to preserve the user trust and network integrity. Some state-of-the art approaches to phishing detection in smart contracts rely on the online analysis of transactions and their traces. However, replaying transactions often exposes sensitive user data and interactions, with several security concerns. In this work, we present PhishingHook, a framework that applies machine learning techniques to detect phishing activities in smart contracts by directly analyzing the contract's bytecode and its constituent opcodes. We evaluate the efficacy of such techniques in identifying malicious patterns, suspicious function calls, or anomalous behaviors within the contract's code itself before it is deployed or interacted with. We experimentally compare 16 techniques, belonging to four main categories (Histogram Similarity Classifiers, Vision Models, Language Models and Vulnerability Detection Models), using 7,000 real-world malware smart contracts. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of PhishingHook in performing phishing classification systems, with about 90% average accuracy among all the models. We support experimental reproducibility, and we release our code and datasets to the research community.

<title>Decompiling Smart Contracts with a Large Language Model</title>

Abstract: The widespread lack of broad source code verification on blockchain explorers such as Etherscan, where despite 78,047,845 smart contracts deployed on Ethereum (as of May 26, 2025), a mere 767,520 (< 1%) are open source, presents a severe impediment to blockchain security. This opacity necessitates the automated semantic analysis of on-chain smart contract bytecode, a fundamental research challenge with direct implications for identifying vulnerabilities and understanding malicious behavior. Prevailing decompilers struggle to reverse bytecode in a readable manner, often yielding convoluted code that critically hampers vulnerability analysis and thwarts efforts to dissect contract functionalities for security auditing.
  This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a pioneering decompilation pipeline that, for the first time, successfully leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode into human-readable and semantically faithful Solidity code. Our novel methodology first employs rigorous static program analysis to convert bytecode into a structured three-address code (TAC) representation. This intermediate representation then guides a Llama-3.2-3B model, specifically fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset of 238,446 TAC-to-Solidity function pairs, to generate high-quality Solidity. This approach uniquely recovers meaningful variable names, intricate control flow, and precise function signatures. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates a significant leap beyond traditional decompilers, achieving an average semantic similarity of 0.82 with original source and markedly superior readability. The practical viability and effectiveness of our research are demonstrated through its implementation in a publicly accessible system, available at https://evmdecompiler.com.

Abstract: In this paper we focus on TinySol, a minimal calculus for Solidity smart contracts, introduced by Bartoletti et al. We start by rephrasing its syntax (to emphasise its object-oriented flavour) and give a new big-step operational semantics. We then use it to define two security properties, namely call integrity and noninterference. These two properties have some similarities in their definition, in that they both require that some part of a program is not influenced by the other part. However, we show that the two properties are actually incomparable. Nevertheless, we provide a type system for noninterference and show that well-typed programs satisfy call integrity as well; hence, programs that are accepted by our type system satisfy both properties. We finally discuss the practical usability of the type system and its limitations by means of some simple examples.

Abstract: Price feeds of cryptocurrencies are essential for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications to realize fundamental trading and exchanging functionalities, which are retrieved from external price data sources such as exchanges and input to on-chain smart contracts in real-time. Currently, arithmetic mean based time-weighted average price (TWAP) oracles are widely used to process price feeds by averaging asset price with short time frame to achieve reliable and gas-efficient pricing. However, recent research indicates that TWAP is vulnerable to price manipulation attacks, resulting in abnormal price fluctuations and severe financial loss. Even worse, TWAP oracles usually set a relatively long time frame setting to prevent such attack. However, it would further introduce long delays and high price deviation errors from the market asset price.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel on-chain gas-efficient pricing algorithm (Ormer) that heuristically estimates the median of asset price within an observation window based on a piecewise-parabolic formula, while the time delay is suppressed by fusing estimations with different window sizes. Our evaluation based on multiple pairs of token swapping price feed across different chains show that Ormer reduces the mean absolute price error by 15.3% and the time delay by 49.3% compared to TWAP. For gas efficiency, regardless of the number of price observations, an encoding mechanism with constant storage requirement is employed without saving all the historical data for median estimation. Surprisingly, the lowest gas consumption of Ormer is even 15.2% less than TWAP, and the oracle querying fee would be saved up to ~20K USD per day for DeFi participants.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, we typically refer to unsupervised pre-training when we aim to pre-train a policy without a priori access to the task specification, i.e. rewards, to be later employed for efficient learning of downstream tasks. In single-agent settings, the problem has been extensively studied and mostly understood. A popular approach, called task-agnostic exploration, casts the unsupervised objective as maximizing the entropy of the state distribution induced by the agent's policy, from which principles and methods follow.
  In contrast, little is known about it in multi-agent settings, which are ubiquitous in the real world. What are the pros and cons of alternative problem formulations in this setting? How hard is the problem in theory, how can we solve it in practice? In this paper, we address these questions by first characterizing those alternative formulations and highlighting how the problem, even when tractable in theory, is non-trivial in practice. Then, we present a scalable, decentralized, trust-region policy search algorithm to address the problem in practical settings. Finally, we provide numerical validations to both corroborate the theoretical findings and pave the way for unsupervised multi-agent reinforcement learning via task-agnostic exploration in challenging domains, showing that optimizing for a specific objective, namely mixture entropy, provides an excellent trade-off between tractability and performances.

Abstract: Coordinating communication and control is a key component in the stability and performance of networked multi-agent systems. While single user networked control systems have gained a lot of attention within this domain, in this work, we address the more challenging problem of large population multi-team dynamic games. In particular, each team constitutes two decision makers (namely, the sensor and the controller) who coordinate over a shared network to control a dynamically evolving state of interest under costs on both actuation and sensing/communication. Due to the shared nature of the wireless channel, the overall cost of each team depends on other teams' policies, thereby leading to a noncooperative game setup. Due to the presence of a large number of teams, we compute approximate decentralized Nash equilibrium policies for each team using the paradigm of (extended) mean-field games, which is governed by (1) the mean traffic flowing over the channel, and (2) the value of information at the sensor, which highlights the semantic nature of the ensuing communication. In the process, we compute optimal controller policies and approximately optimal sensor policies for each representative team of the mean-field system to alleviate the problem of general non-contractivity of the mean-field fixed point operator associated with the finite cardinality of the sensor action space. Consequently, we also prove the $\epsilon$--Nash property of the mean-field equilibrium solution which essentially characterizes how well the solution derived using mean-field analysis performs on the finite-team system. Finally, we provide extensive numerical simulations, which corroborate the theoretical findings and lead to additional insights on the properties of the results presented.

Abstract: The present dissertation addresses the problem of fairly distributing shared resources in non-commercial blockchain networks. Blockchains are distributed systems that order and timestamp records of a given network of users, in a public, cryptographically secure, and consensual way. The records, which may in kind be events, transaction orders, sets of rules for structured transactions etc. are placed within well-defined datastructures called blocks, and they are linked to each other by the virtue of cryptographic pointers, in a total ordering which represents their temporal relations of succession. The ability to operate on the blockchain, and/or to contribute a record to the content of a block are shared resources of the blockchain systems. In commercial networks, these resources are exchanged in return for fiat money, and consequently, fairness is not a relevant problem in terms of computer engineering. In non-commercial networks, however, monetary solutions are not available, by definition. The present non-commercial blockchain networks employ trivial distribution mechanisms called faucets, which offer fixed amounts of free tokens (called cryptocurrencies) specific to the given network. This mechanism, although simple and efficient, is prone to denial of service (DoS) attacks and cannot address the fairness problem. In the present dissertation, the faucet mechanism is adapted for fair distribution, in line with Max-min Fairness scheme. In total, we contributed 6 distinct Max-min Fair algorithms as efficient blockchain faucets. The algorithms we contribute are resistant to DoS attacks, low-cost in terms of blockchain computation economics, and they also allow for different user weighting policies.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of multi-agent systems (MAS) in critical infrastructures such as autonomous transportation, disaster relief, and smart cities demands robust formation control mechanisms resilient to adversarial attacks. Traditional consensus-based controllers, while effective under nominal conditions, are highly vulnerable to data manipulation, sensor spoofing, and communication failures. To address this challenge, we propose Second-Order State Hallucination (SOSH), a novel framework that detects compromised agents through distributed residual monitoring and maintains formation stability by replacing attacked states with predictive second-order approximations. Unlike existing mitigation strategies that require significant restructuring or induce long transients, SOSH offers a lightweight, decentralized correction mechanism based on second-order Taylor expansions, enabling rapid and scalable resilience. We establish rigorous Lyapunov-based stability guarantees, proving that formation errors remain exponentially bounded even under persistent attacks, provided the hallucination parameters satisfy explicit conditions. Comprehensive Monte Carlo experiments on a 5-agent complete graph formation demonstrate that SOSH outperforms established robust control schemes, including W-MSR and Huber-based consensus filters, achieving faster convergence rates, lower steady-state error, and superior transient recovery. Our results confirm that SOSH combines theoretical robustness with practical deployability, offering a promising direction for securing MAS formations against sophisticated adversarial threats.

Abstract: The social metaverse is a growing digital ecosystem that blends virtual and physical worlds. It allows users to interact socially, work, shop, and enjoy entertainment. However, privacy remains a major challenge, as immersive interactions require continuous collection of biometric and behavioral data. At the same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to the demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth optimization. To address these issues, we propose ASMS (Adaptive Social Metaverse Streaming), a novel streaming system based on Federated Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy. Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14% compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions. Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks, while ensuring that sensitive user data remains on local devices.

Abstract: Federated learning continues to evolve but faces challenges in interpretability and explainability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach that employs Neural Additive Models (NAMs) within a federated learning framework. This new Federated Neural Additive Models (FedNAMs) approach merges the advantages of NAMs, where individual networks concentrate on specific input features, with the decentralized approach of federated learning, ultimately producing interpretable analysis results. This integration enhances privacy by training on local data across multiple devices, thereby minimizing the risks associated with data centralization and improving model robustness and generalizability. FedNAMs maintain detailed, feature-specific learning, making them especially valuable in sectors such as finance and healthcare. They facilitate the training of client-specific models to integrate local updates, preserve privacy, and mitigate concerns related to centralization. Our studies on various text and image classification tasks, using datasets such as OpenFetch ML Wine, UCI Heart Disease, and Iris, show that FedNAMs deliver strong interpretability with minimal accuracy loss compared to traditional Federated Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The research involves notable findings, including the identification of critical predictive features at both client and global levels. Volatile acidity, sulfates, and chlorides for wine quality. Chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and number of vessels for heart disease. Petal length and width for iris classification. This approach strengthens privacy and model efficiency and improves interpretability and robustness across diverse datasets. Finally, FedNAMs generate insights on causes of highly and low interpretable features.

<title>A Smart Contract-based Non-Transferable Signature Verification System using Nominative Signatures</title>

Abstract: Nominative signatures allow us to indicate who can verify a signature, and they can be employed to construct a non-transferable signature verification system that prevents the signature verification by a third party in unexpected situations. For example, this system can prevent IOU/loan certificate verification in unexpected situations. However, nominative signatures themselves do not allow the verifier to check whether the funds will be transferred in the future or have been transferred.It would be desirable to verify the fact simultaneously when the system involves a certain money transfer such as cryptocurrencies/cryptoassets. In this paper, we propose a smart contract-based non-transferable signature verification system using nominative signatures. We pay attention to the fact that the invisibility, which is a security requirement to be held for nominative signatures, allows us to publish nominative signatures on the blockchain. Our system can verify whether a money transfer actually will take place, in addition to indicating who can verify a signature. We transform the Hanaoka-Schuldt nominative signature scheme (ACNS 2011, IEICE Trans. 2016) which is constructed over a symmetric pairing to a scheme constructed over an asymmetric pairing, and evaluate the gas cost when a smart contract runs the verification algorithm of the modified Hanaoka-Schuldt nominative signature scheme.

<title>Decoding Federated Learning: The FedNAM+ Conformal Revolution</title>

Abstract: Federated learning has significantly advanced distributed training of machine learning models across decentralized data sources. However, existing frameworks often lack comprehensive solutions that combine uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a federated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with a novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable uncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment technique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input features influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and pixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods such as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+ offers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach through experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high prediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with transparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable uncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance can be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+ delivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational overhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios. Overall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized predictive modeling.

<title>Secure User-friendly Blockchain Modular Wallet Design Using Android &amp; OP-TEE</title>

Abstract: Emerging crypto economies still hemorrhage digital assets because legacy wallets leak private keys at almost every layer of the software stack, from user-space libraries to kernel memory dumps. This paper solves that twin crisis of security and interoperability by re-imagining key management as a platform-level service anchored in ARM TrustZone through OP-TEE. Our architecture fractures the traditional monolithic Trusted Application into per-chain modules housed in a multi-tenant TA store, finally breaking OP-TEE's single-binary ceiling. A cryptographically sealed firmware-over-the-air pipeline welds each TA set to an Android system image, enabling hot-swap updates while Verified Boot enforces rollback protection. Every package carries a chained signature developer first, registry second so even a compromised supply chain cannot smuggle malicious code past the Secure World's RSA-PSS gatekeeper. Inside the TEE, strict inter-TA isolation, cache partitioning, and GP-compliant crypto APIs ensure secrets never bleed across trust boundaries or timing domains. The Rich Execution Environment can interact only via hardware-mediated Secure Monitor Calls, collapsing the surface exposed to malware in Android space. End-users enjoy a single polished interface yet can install or retire Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, or tomorrow's chain with one tap, shrinking both storage footprint and audit scope. For auditors, the composition model slashes duplicated verification effort by quarantining blockchain logic inside narrowly scoped modules that share formally specified interfaces. Our threat analysis spans six adversary layers and shows how the design neutralizes REE malware sniffing, OTA injection, and cross-module side channels without exotic hardware. A reference implementation on AOSP exports a Wallet Manager HAL, custom SELinux domains, and a CI/CD pipeline that vet community modules before release. The result is not merely another hardware wallet but a programmable substrate that can evolve at the velocity of the blockchain ecosystem. By welding radical extensibility to hardware-anchored assurance, the platform closes the security-usability gap that has long stymied mass-market self-custody. We posit that modular TEEs are the missing OS primitive for Web3, much as virtual memory unlocked multi-tasking in classical computing. Together, these contributions sketch a blueprint for multi-chain asset management that is auditable, resilient, and poised for global deployment.

Abstract: Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) technologies are foundational in driving maritime autonomy, particularly for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). However, onboard computational constraints and communication latency significantly restrict real-time data processing, analysis, and predictive modeling, hence limiting the scalability and responsiveness of maritime ICPS. To overcome these challenges, we propose a distributed Cloud-Edge-IoT architecture tailored for maritime ICPS by leveraging design principles from the recently proposed Cloud-Fog Automation paradigm. Our proposed architecture comprises three hierarchical layers: a Cloud Layer for centralized and decentralized data aggregation, advanced analytics, and future model refinement; an Edge Layer that executes localized AI-driven processing and decision-making; and an IoT Layer responsible for low-latency sensor data acquisition. Our experimental results demonstrated improvements in computational efficiency, responsiveness, and scalability. When compared with our conventional approaches, we achieved a classification accuracy of 86\%, with an improved latency performance. By adopting Cloud-Fog Automation, we address the low-latency processing constraints and scalability challenges in maritime ICPS applications. Our work offers a practical, modular, and scalable framework to advance robust autonomy and AI-driven decision-making and autonomy for intelligent USVs in future maritime ICPS.

Abstract: Initially introduced to Ethereum via Flashbots' MEV-boost, Proposer-Builder Separation allows proposers to auction off blockspace to a market of transaction orderers, known as builders. PBS is currently available to validators through the aforementioned MEV-boost, but its unregulated and relay-dependent nature has much of the Ethereum community calling for its enshrinement. Providing a protocol-integrated PBS marketspace and communication channel for payload outsourcing is termed PBS enshrinement. Although ePBS potentially introduces native MEV mitigation mechanisms and reduces validator operation costs, fears of multiparty collusion and chain stagnation are all too real. In addition to mitigating these potential drawbacks, PBS research pursues many tenets revered by Web3 enthusiasts, including but not limited to, censorship resistance, validator reward equity, and deflationary finance. The subsequent SoK will identify current PBS mechanisms, the need for enshrinement, additions to the ePBS upgrade, and the existing or potential on-chain socioeconomic implications of each.

<title>Smart-LLaMA-DPO: Reinforced Large Language Model for Explainable Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection</title>

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerability detection remains a major challenge in blockchain security. Existing vulnerability detection methods face two main issues: (1) Existing datasets lack comprehensive coverage and high-quality explanations for preference learning. (2) Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with accurately interpreting specific concepts in smart contract security. Empirical analysis shows that even after continual pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), LLMs may misinterpret the execution order of state changes, resulting in incorrect explanations despite making correct detection decisions. To address these challenges, we propose Smart-LLaMA-DPO based on LLaMA-3.1-8B. We construct a comprehensive dataset covering four major vulnerability types and machine-unauditable vulnerabilities, including precise labels, explanations, and locations for SFT, as well as high-quality and low-quality output pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Second, we perform CPT using large-scale smart contract to enhance the LLM's understanding of specific security practices in smart contracts. Futhermore, we conduct SFT with our comprehensive dataset. Finally, we apply DPO, leveraging human feedback and a specially designed loss function that increases the probability of preferred explanations while reducing the likelihood of non-preferred outputs. We evaluate Smart-LLaMA-DPO on four major vulnerability types: reentrancy, timestamp dependence, integer overflow/underflow, and delegatecall, as well as machine-unauditable vulnerabilities. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with average improvements of 10.43% in F1 score and 7.87% in accuracy. Moreover, both LLM evaluation and human evaluation confirm that our method generates more correct, thorough, and clear explanations.

Abstract: Open source software development, particularly within institutions such as universities and research laboratories, is often decentralized and difficult to track. Despite producing highly impactful tools in science, these efforts often go unrecognized due to a lack of visibility and institutional awareness. This paper addresses the challenge of discovering, classifying, and analyzing open source software projects developed across distributed institutional systems. We present a framework for systematically identifying institutional affiliated repositories, using the University of California (UC) system as a case study.
  Using GitHub's REST API, we build a pipeline to discover relevant repositories and extract meaningful metadata. We then propose and evaluate multiple classification strategies, including both traditional machine learning models and large language models (LLMs), to distinguish affiliated projects from unrelated repositories and generate accurate insights into the academic open source landscape. Our results show that the framework is effective at scale, discovering over 52,000 repositories and predicting institutional affiliation with high accuracy.

Abstract: We present the Multi-Agent Transformer World Model (MATWM), a novel transformer-based world model designed for multi-agent reinforcement learning in both vector- and image-based environments. MATWM combines a decentralized imagination framework with a semi-centralized critic and a teammate prediction module, enabling agents to model and anticipate the behavior of others under partial observability. To address non-stationarity, we incorporate a prioritized replay mechanism that trains the world model on recent experiences, allowing it to adapt to agents' evolving policies. We evaluated MATWM on a broad suite of benchmarks, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, PettingZoo, and MeltingPot. MATWM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both model-free and prior world model approaches, while demonstrating strong sample efficiency, achieving near-optimal performance in as few as 50K environment interactions. Ablation studies confirm the impact of each component, with substantial gains in coordination-heavy tasks.

Abstract: TRIZ, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, is a structured, knowledge-based framework for innovation and abstracting problems to find inventive solutions. However, its application is often limited by the complexity and deep interdisciplinary knowledge required. Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed new possibilities for automating parts of this process. While previous studies have explored single LLMs in TRIZ applications, this paper introduces a multi-agent approach. We propose an LLM-based multi-agent system, called TRIZ agents, each with specialized capabilities and tool access, collaboratively solving inventive problems based on the TRIZ methodology. This multi-agent system leverages agents with various domain expertise to efficiently navigate TRIZ steps. The aim is to model and simulate an inventive process with language agents. We assess the effectiveness of this team of agents in addressing complex innovation challenges based on a selected case study in engineering. We demonstrate the potential of agent collaboration to produce diverse, inventive solutions. This research contributes to the future of AI-driven innovation, showcasing the advantages of decentralized problem-solving in complex ideation tasks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing raw data, yet faces significant challenges in real-world settings where client data distributions evolve dynamically over time. This paper tackles the critical problem of covariate and label shifts in streaming FL environments, where non-stationary data distributions degrade model performance and require adaptive middleware solutions. We introduce ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework that dynamically creates and trains specialized global models in response to detected distribution shifts using Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate shifts. The framework employs a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse and implements facility location-based optimization to jointly minimize covariate mismatch, expert creation costs, and label imbalance. Through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate 5.5-12.9 percentage point accuracy improvements and 22-95 % faster adaptation compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse shift scenarios. The proposed approach offers a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware solution for FL systems operating in non-stationary, real-world conditions while minimizing communication and computational overhead.

Abstract: High-quality smart contract vulnerability datasets are critical for evaluating security tools and advancing smart contract security research. Two major limitations of current manual dataset construction are (1) labor-intensive and error-prone annotation processes limiting the scale, quality, and evolution of the dataset, and (2) absence of standardized classification rules results in inconsistent vulnerability categories and labeling results across different datasets. To address these limitations, we present FORGE, the first automated approach for constructing smart contract vulnerability datasets. FORGE leverages an LLM-driven pipeline to extract high-quality vulnerabilities from real-world audit reports and classify them according to the CWE, the most widely recognized classification in software security. FORGE employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to extract structured and self-contained vulnerability information from these reports. Additionally, it uses a tree-of-thoughts technique to classify the vulnerability information into the hierarchical CWE classification. To evaluate FORGE's effectiveness, we run FORGE on 6,454 real-world audit reports and generate a dataset comprising 81,390 solidity files and 27,497 vulnerability findings across 296 CWE categories. Manual assessment of the dataset demonstrates high extraction precision and classification consistency with human experts (precision of 95.6% and inter-rater agreement k-$\alpha$ of 0.87). We further validate the practicality of our dataset by benchmarking 13 existing security tools on our dataset. The results reveal the significant limitations in current detection capabilities. Furthermore, by analyzing the severity-frequency distribution patterns through a unified CWE perspective in our dataset, we highlight inconsistency between current smart contract research focus and priorities identified from real-world vulnerabilities...

LayerZero enforces strict application-exclusive ownership of protocol security and cost through its novel trust-minimized modular security framework which is designed to universally support all blockchains and use cases. Omnichain applications (OApps) built on the LayerZero protocol achieve frictionless blockchain-agnostic interoperation through LayerZero's universal network semantics.

Abstract: Selfish mining is strategic rule-breaking to maximize rewards in proof-of-work protocols. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are the preferred tool for finding optimal strategies in Bitcoin and similar linear chain protocols. Protocols increasingly adopt DAG-based chain structures, for which MDP analysis is more involved. To date, researchers have tailored specific MDPs for each protocol. Protocol design suffers long feedback loops, as each protocol change implies manual work on the MDP. To overcome this, we propose a generic attack model that covers a wide range of protocols, including Ethereum Proof-of-Work, GhostDAG, and Parallel Proof-of-Work. Our approach is modular: we specify each protocol as a concise program, and our tooling then derives and solves the selfish mining MDP automatically.

Abstract: This work addresses the inherent issues of high latency in blockchains and low scalability in traditional consensus protocols. We present pod, a novel notion of consensus whose first priority is to achieve the physically-optimal latency of one round-trip, i.e., requiring only one network trip for writing a transaction and one for reading it. To accomplish this, we first eliminate inter-replica communication. Instead, clients send transactions directly to all replicas, which independently process transactions and append them to local logs. Replicas assigns a timestamp and a sequence number to each transaction in their logs, allowing clients to extract valuable metadata about the transactions and the system state. Later on, clients retrieve these logs and extract transactions (and associated metadata) from them. Necessarily, this construction achieves weaker properties than a total-order broadcast protocol, due to existing lower bounds. Our work models the primitive of pod and defines its security properties. We then show pod-core, a protocol that satisfies properties such as transaction confirmation within $2\delta$, censorship resistance against Byzantine replicas, and accountability for safety violations. We show that single-shot auctions can be realized using the pod notion and observe that it is also sufficient for other popular applications.

Abstract: With the advance application of blockchain technology in various fields, ensuring the security and stability of smart contracts has emerged as a critical challenge. Current security analysis methodologies in vulnerability detection can be categorized into static analysis and dynamic analysis methods.However, these existing traditional vulnerability detection methods predominantly rely on analyzing original contract code, not all smart contracts provide accessible code.We present ETrace, a novel event-driven vulnerability detection framework for smart contracts, which uniquely identifies potential vulnerabilities through LLM-powered trace analysis without requiring source code access. By extracting fine-grained event sequences from transaction logs, the framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as adaptive semantic interpreters to reconstruct event analysis through chain-of-thought reasoning. ETrace implements pattern-matching to establish causal links between transaction behavior patterns and known attack behaviors. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of ETrace through preliminary experimental results.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent systems often face tasks that require coordinated actions under uncertainty. While multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems provide a powerful framework for decentralized learning, most prior work assumes individually attainable rewards. We address the challenging setting where rewards are threshold-activated: an arm yields a payoff only when a minimum number of agents pull it simultaneously, with this threshold unknown in advance. Complicating matters further, some arms are decoys - requiring coordination to activate but yielding no reward - introducing a new challenge of wasted joint exploration. We introduce Threshold-Coop-UCB (T-Coop-UCB), a decentralized algorithm that enables agents to jointly learn activation thresholds and reward distributions, forming effective coalitions without centralized control. Empirical results show that T-Coop-UCB consistently outperforms baseline methods in cumulative reward, regret, and coordination metrics, achieving near-Oracle performance. Our findings underscore the importance of joint threshold learning and decoy avoidance for scalable, decentralized cooperation in complex multi-agent

Abstract: We study bandit learning in matching markets with two-sided reward uncertainty, extending prior research primarily focused on single-sided uncertainty. Leveraging the concept of `super-stability' from Irving (1994), we demonstrate the advantage of the Extended Gale-Shapley (GS) algorithm over the standard GS algorithm in achieving true stable matchings under incomplete information. By employing the Extended GS algorithm, our centralized algorithm attains a logarithmic pessimal stable regret dependent on an instance-dependent admissible gap parameter. This algorithm is further adapted to a decentralized setting with a constant regret increase. Finally, we establish a novel centralized instance-dependent lower bound for binary stable regret, elucidating the roles of the admissible gap and super-stable matching in characterizing the complexity of stable matching with bandit feedback.

Abstract: Blockchain-based steganography enables data hiding via encoding the covert data into a specific blockchain transaction field. However, previous works focus on the specific field-embedding methods while lacking a consideration on required field-generation embedding. In this paper, we propose a generic blockchain-based steganography framework (GBSF). The sender generates the required fields such as amount and fees, where the additional covert data is embedded to enhance the channel capacity. Based on GBSF, we design a reversible generative adversarial network (R-GAN) that utilizes the generative adversarial network with a reversible generator to generate the required fields and encode additional covert data into the input noise of the reversible generator. We then explore the performance flaw of R-GAN. To further improve the performance, we propose R-GAN with Counter-intuitive data preprocessing and Custom activation functions, namely CCR-GAN. The counter-intuitive data preprocessing (CIDP) mechanism is used to reduce decoding errors in covert data, while it incurs gradient explosion for model convergence. The custom activation function named ClipSigmoid is devised to overcome the problem. Theoretical justification for CIDP and ClipSigmoid is also provided. We also develop a mechanism named T2C, which balances capacity and concealment. We conduct experiments using the transaction amount of the Bitcoin mainnet as the required field to verify the feasibility. We then apply the proposed schemes to other transaction fields and blockchains to demonstrate the scalability. Finally, we evaluate capacity and concealment for various blockchains and transaction fields and explore the trade-off between capacity and concealment. The results demonstrate that R-GAN and CCR-GAN are able to enhance the channel capacity effectively and outperform state-of-the-art works.

Abstract: Federated prompt learning (FPL) for vision-language models is a powerful approach to collaboratively adapt models across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, existing FPL approaches suffer from a trade-off between performance and robustness, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios. The inherent in-distribution (ID) data heterogeneity among different clients makes it more challenging to maintain this trade-off. To fill this gap, we introduce a Federated OOD-aware Context Optimization (FOCoOp) framework, which captures diverse distributions among clients using ID global prompts, local prompts, and OOD prompts. Specifically, FOCoOp leverages three sets of prompts to create both class-level and distribution-level separations, which adapt to OOD shifts through bi-level distributionally robust optimization. Additionally, FOCoOp improves the discrimination consistency among clients, i.e., calibrating global prompts, seemingly OOD prompts, and OOD prompts by semi-unbalanced optimal transport. The extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FOCoOp effectively captures decentralized heterogeneous distributions and enhances robustness of different OOD shifts. The project is available at GitHub.

Abstract: With the rise of distributed energy resources and sector coupling, distributed optimization can be a sensible approach to coordinate decentralized energy resources. Further, district heating, heat pumps, cogeneration, and sharing concepts like local energy communities introduce the potential to optimize heating and electricity output simultaneously. To solve this issue, we tackle the distributed multi-energy scheduling optimization problem, which describes the optimization of distributed energy generators over multiple time steps to reach a specific target schedule. This work describes a novel distributed hybrid algorithm as a solution approach. This approach is based on the heuristics of gossiping and local search and can simultaneously optimize the private objective of the participants and the collective objective, considering multiple energy sectors. We show that the algorithm finds globally near-optimal solutions while protecting the stakeholders' economic goals and the plants' technical properties. Two test cases representing pure electrical and gas-based technologies are evaluated.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) protects data privacy while providing a decentralized method for training models. However, because of the distributed schema, it is susceptible to adversarial clients that could alter results or sabotage model performance. This study presents SecureFed, a two-phase FL framework for identifying and reducing the impact of such attackers. Phase 1 involves collecting model updates from participating clients and applying a dimensionality reduction approach to identify outlier patterns frequently associated with malicious behavior. Temporary models constructed from the client updates are evaluated on synthetic datasets to compute validation losses and support anomaly scoring. The idea of learning zones is presented in Phase 2, where weights are dynamically routed according to their contribution scores and gradient magnitudes. High-value gradient zones are given greater weight in aggregation and contribute more significantly to the global model, while lower-value gradient zones, which may indicate possible adversarial activity, are gradually removed from training. Until the model converges and a strong defense against poisoning attacks is possible, this training cycle continues Based on the experimental findings, SecureFed considerably improves model resilience without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Web3 technologies have experienced unprecedented growth in the last decade, achieving widespread adoption. As various blockchain networks continue to evolve, we are on the cusp of a paradigm shift in which they could provide services traditionally offered by the Internet, but in a decentralized manner, marking the emergence of the Internet of Blockchains. While significant progress has been achieved in enabling interoperability between blockchain networks, existing solutions often assume that networks are already mutually aware. This reveals a critical gap: the initial discovery of blockchain networks remains largely unaddressed. This paper proposes a decentralized architecture for blockchain network discovery that operates independently of any centralized authority. We also introduce a mechanism for discovering assets and services within a blockchain from external networks. Given the decentralized nature of the proposed discovery architecture, we design an incentive mechanism to encourage nodes to actively participate in maintaining the discovery network. The proposed architecture implemented and evaluated, using the Substrate framework, demonstrates its resilience and scalability, effectively handling up to 130,000 concurrent requests under the tested network configurations, with a median response time of 5.5 milliseconds, demonstrating the ability to scale its processing capacity further by increasing its network size.

Abstract: Rapid evolution of sensors and resource-efficient machine learning models have spurred the widespread adoption of wearable fitness tracking devices. Equipped with inertial sensors, such devices can continuously capture physical movements for fitness technology (FitTech), enabling applications from sports optimization to preventive healthcare. Traditional centralized learning approaches to detect fitness activities struggle with privacy concerns, regulatory constraints, and communication inefficiencies. In contrast, Federated Learning (FL) enables a decentralized model training by communicating model updates rather than private wearable sensor data. Applying FL to FitTech presents unique challenges, such as data imbalance, lack of labelled data, heterogeneous user activity patterns, and trade-offs between personalization and generalization. To simplify research on FitTech in FL, we present the FedFitTech baseline, under the Flower framework, which is publicly available and widely used by both industry and academic researchers. Additionally, to illustrate its usage, this paper presents a case study that implements a system based on the FedFitTech baseline, incorporating a client-side early stopping strategy and comparing the results. For instance, this system allows wearable devices to optimize the trade-off between capturing common fitness activity patterns and preserving individuals' nuances, thereby enhancing both the scalability and efficiency of privacy-aware fitness tracking applications. Results show that this reduces overall redundant communications by 13 percent, while maintaining the overall recognition performance at a negligible recognition cost by 1 percent. Thus, FedFitTech baseline creates a foundation for a wide range of new research and development opportunities in FitTech, and it is available as open-source at: https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/baselines/fedfittech

<title>Latent Noise Injection for Private and Statistically Aligned Synthetic Data Generation</title>

Abstract: Synthetic Data Generation has become essential for scalable, privacy-preserving statistical analysis. While standard approaches based on generative models, such as Normalizing Flows, have been widely used, they often suffer from slow convergence in high-dimensional settings, frequently converging more slowly than the canonical $1/\sqrt{n}$ rate when approximating the true data distribution.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a Latent Noise Injection method using Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAF). Instead of directly sampling from the trained model, our method perturbs each data point in the latent space and maps it back to the data domain. This construction preserves a one to one correspondence between observed and synthetic data, enabling synthetic outputs that closely reflect the underlying distribution, particularly in challenging high-dimensional regimes where traditional sampling struggles.
  Our procedure satisfies local $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy and introduces a single perturbation parameter to control the privacy-utility trade-off. Although estimators based on individual synthetic datasets may converge slowly, we show both theoretically and empirically that aggregating across $K$ studies in a meta analysis framework restores classical efficiency and yields consistent, reliable inference. We demonstrate that with a well-calibrated perturbation parameter, Latent Noise Injection achieves strong statistical alignment with the original data and robustness against membership inference attacks. These results position our method as a compelling alternative to conventional flow-based sampling for synthetic data sharing in decentralized and privacy-sensitive domains, such as biomedical research.

Abstract: Sequential learning in a multi-agent resource constrained matching market has received significant interest in the past few years. We study decentralized learning in two-sided matching markets where the demand side (aka players or agents) competes for the supply side (aka arms) with potentially time-varying preferences to obtain a stable match. Motivated by the linear contextual bandit framework, we assume that for each agent, an arm-mean may be represented by a linear function of a known feature vector and an unknown (agent-specific) parameter. Moreover, the preferences over arms depend on a latent environment in each round, where the latent environment varies across rounds in a non-stationary manner. We propose learning algorithms to identify the latent environment and obtain stable matchings simultaneously. Our proposed algorithms achieve instance-dependent logarithmic regret, scaling independently of the number of arms, and hence applicable for a large market.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal (non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.

Abstract: Mobile Virtual Reality (VR) is essential to achieving convenient and immersive human-computer interaction and realizing emerging applications such as Metaverse. However, existing VR technologies require two separate renderings of binocular images, causing a significant bottleneck for mobile devices with limited computing capability and power supply. This paper proposes an approach to rendering optimization for mobile VR called EffVR. By utilizing the per-pixel attribute, EffVR can generate binocular VR images from the monocular image through genuinely one rendering, saving half the computation over conventional approaches. Our evaluation indicates that, compared with the state-of-art, EffVRcan save 27% power consumption on average while achieving high binocular image quality (0.9679 SSIM and 34.09 PSNR) in mobile VR applications. Additionally, EffVR can increase the frame rate by 115.2%. These results corroborate EffVRsuperior computation/energy-saving performance, paving the road to a sustainable mobile VR.

<title>All is Not Lost: LLM Recovery without Checkpoints</title>

Abstract: Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization. The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose, CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However, because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+ with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates (5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our proposals can be run via our code available at: https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

Abstract: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI, i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based, always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) network can address the issue of limited computing resources and data processing capabilities of individual vehicles, but it also brings the risk of privacy leakage to vehicle users. Applying blockchain technology can establish secure data links within the IoV, solving the problems of insufficient computing resources for each vehicle and the security of data transmission over the network. However, with the development of the IoV, the amount of data interaction between multiple vehicles and between vehicles and base stations, roadside units, etc., is continuously increasing. There is a need to further reduce the interaction volume, and intelligent data compression is key to solving this problem. The VIB technique facilitates the training of encoding and decoding models, substantially diminishing the volume of data that needs to be transmitted. This paper introduces an innovative approach that integrates blockchain with VIB, referred to as BVIB, designed to lighten computational workloads and reinforce the security of the network. We first construct a new network framework by separating the encoding and decoding networks to address the computational burden issue, and then propose a new algorithm to enhance the security of IoV networks. We also discuss the impact of the data extraction rate on system latency to determine the most suitable data extraction rate. An experimental framework combining Python and C++ has been established to substantiate the efficacy of our BVIB approach. Comprehensive simulation studies indicate that the BVIB consistently excels in comparison to alternative foundational methodologies.

Abstract: Advancements in deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have positioned it as a promising approach for decision-making in cooperative games. However, it still remains challenging for MARL agents to learn cooperative strategies for some game environments. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent reasoning capabilities, making them promising candidates for enhancing coordination among the agents. However, due to the model size of LLMs, it can be expensive to frequently infer LLMs for actions that agents can take. In this work, we propose You Only LLM Once for MARL (YOLO-MARL), a novel framework that leverages the high-level task planning capabilities of LLMs to improve the policy learning process of multi-agents in cooperative games. Notably, for each game environment, YOLO-MARL only requires one time interaction with LLMs in the proposed strategy generation, state interpretation and planning function generation modules, before the MARL policy training process. This avoids the ongoing costs and computational time associated with frequent LLMs API calls during training. Moreover, trained decentralized policies based on normal-sized neural networks operate independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method across two different environments and demonstrate that YOLO-MARL outperforms traditional MARL algorithms.

<title>Cross-Chain Arbitrage: The Next Frontier of MEV in Decentralized Finance</title>

Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) markets spread across Layer-1 (L1) and Layer-2 (L2) blockchains rely on arbitrage to keep prices aligned. Today most price gaps are closed against centralized exchanges (CEXes), whose deep liquidity and fast execution make them the primary venue for price discovery. As trading volume migrates on-chain, cross-chain arbitrage between decentralized exchanges (DEXes) will become the canonical mechanism for price alignment. Yet, despite its importance to DeFi-and the on-chain transparency making real activity tractable in a way CEX-to-DEX arbitrage is not-existing research remains confined to conceptual overviews and hypothetical opportunity analyses.
  We study cross-chain arbitrage with a profit-cost model and a year-long measurement. The model shows that opportunity frequency, bridging time, and token depreciation determine whether inventory- or bridge-based execution is more profitable. Empirically, we analyze one year of transactions (September 2023 - August 2024) across nine blockchains and identify 242,535 executed arbitrages totaling 868.64 million USD volume. Activity clusters on Ethereum-centric L1-L2 pairs, grows 5.5x over the study period, and surges-higher volume, more trades, lower fees-after the Dencun upgrade (March 13, 2024). Most trades use pre-positioned inventory (66.96%) and settle in 9s, whereas bridge-based arbitrages take 242s, underscoring the latency cost of today's bridges. Market concentration is high: the five largest addresses execute more than half of all trades, and one alone captures almost 40% of daily volume post-Dencun. We conclude that cross-chain arbitrage fosters vertical integration, centralizing sequencing infrastructure and economic power and thereby exacerbating censorship, liveness, and finality risks; decentralizing block building and lowering entry barriers are critical to countering these threats.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based traffic signal control (RL-TSC) has emerged as a promising approach for improving urban mobility. However, its robustness under real-world disruptions such as traffic incidents remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce T-REX, an open-source, SUMO-based simulation framework for training and evaluating RL-TSC methods under dynamic, incident scenarios. T-REX models realistic network-level performance considering drivers' probabilistic rerouting, speed adaptation, and contextual lane-changing, enabling the simulation of congestion propagation under incidents. To assess robustness, we propose a suite of metrics that extend beyond conventional traffic efficiency measures. Through extensive experiments across synthetic and real-world networks, we showcase T-REX for the evaluation of several state-of-the-art RL-TSC methods under multiple real-world deployment paradigms. Our findings show that while independent value-based and decentralized pressure-based methods offer fast convergence and generalization in stable traffic conditions and homogeneous networks, their performance degrades sharply under incident-driven distribution shifts. In contrast, hierarchical coordination methods tend to offer more stable and adaptable performance in large-scale, irregular networks, benefiting from their structured decision-making architecture. However, this comes with the trade-off of slower convergence and higher training complexity. These findings highlight the need for robustness-aware design and evaluation in RL-TSC research. T-REX contributes to this effort by providing an open, standardized and reproducible platform for benchmarking RL methods under dynamic and disruptive traffic scenarios.

Abstract: As Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology continues to advance, edge computing has become an important tool for assisting vehicles in handling complex tasks. However, the process of offloading tasks to edge servers may expose vehicles to malicious external attacks, resulting in information loss or even tampering, thereby creating serious security vulnerabilities. Blockchain technology can maintain a shared ledger among servers. In the Raft consensus mechanism, as long as more than half of the nodes remain operational, the system will not collapse, effectively maintaining the system's robustness and security. To protect vehicle information, we propose a security framework that integrates the Raft consensus mechanism from blockchain technology with edge computing. To address the additional latency introduced by blockchain, we derived a theoretical formula for system delay and proposed a convex optimization solution to minimize the system latency, ensuring that the system meets the requirements for low latency and high reliability. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized data extraction rate significantly reduces system delay, with relatively stable variations in latency. Moreover, the proposed optimization solution based on this model can provide valuable insights for enhancing security and efficiency in future network environments, such as 5G and next-generation smart city systems.

Abstract: The timely exchange of information among robots within a team is vital, but it can be constrained by limited wireless capacity. The inability to deliver information promptly can result in estimation errors that impact collaborative efforts among robots. In this paper, we propose a new metric termed Loss of Information Utility (LoIU) to quantify the freshness and utility of information critical for cooperation. The metric enables robots to prioritize information transmissions within bandwidth constraints. We also propose the estimation of LoIU using belief distributions and accordingly optimize both transmission schedule and resource allocation strategy for device-to-device transmissions to minimize the time-average LoIU within a robot team. A semi-decentralized Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient framework is developed, where each robot functions as an actor responsible for scheduling transmissions among its collaborators while a central critic periodically evaluates and refines the actors in response to mobility and interference. Simulations validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating an enhancement of information freshness and utility by 98%, compared to alternative methods.

Abstract: Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is essential for mitigating urban congestion, yet existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods face challenges in scaling to large networks while maintaining global coordination. Centralized RL suffers from scalability issues, while decentralized approaches often lack unified objectives, resulting in limited network-level efficiency. In this paper, we propose HiLight, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with global adversarial guidance for large-scale TSC. HiLight consists of a high-level Meta-Policy, which partitions the traffic network into subregions and generates sub-goals using a Transformer-LSTM architecture, and a low-level Sub-Policy, which controls individual intersections with global awareness. To improve the alignment between global planning and local execution, we introduce an adversarial training mechanism, where the Meta-Policy generates challenging yet informative sub-goals, and the Sub-Policy learns to surpass these targets, leading to more effective coordination. We evaluate HiLight across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and additionally construct a large-scale Manhattan network with diverse traffic conditions, including peak transitions, adverse weather, and holiday surges. Experimental results show that HiLight exhibits significant advantages in large-scale scenarios and remains competitive across standard benchmarks of varying sizes.

Abstract: The distribution of consensus power is a cornerstone of decentralisation, influencing the security, resilience, and fairness of blockchain networks while ensuring equitable impact among participants. This study provides a rigorous evaluation of consensus power inequality across five prominent blockchain networks - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Hedera, and Algorand - using data collected from January 2022 to July 2024. Leveraging established economic metrics, including the Gini coefficient and Theil index, the research quantitatively assesses how power is distributed among blockchain network participants. A robust dataset, capturing network-specific characteristics such as mining pools, staking patterns, and consensus nodes, forms the foundation of the analysis, enabling meaningful comparisons across diverse architectures. Through an in-depth comparative study, the paper identifies key disparities in consensus power distribution. Hedera and Bitcoin demonstrate more balanced power distribution, aligning closely with the principles of decentralisation. Ethereum and Cardano demonstrate moderate levels of inequality. However, contrary to expectations, Ethereum has become more concentrated following its transition to Proof-of-Stake. Meanwhile, Algorand shows a pronounced centralisation of power. Moreover, the findings highlight the structural and operational drivers of inequality, including economic barriers, governance models, and network effects, offering actionable insights for more equitable network design. This study establishes a methodological framework for evaluating blockchain consensus power inequality, emphasising the importance of targeted strategies to ensure fairer power distribution and enhancing the sustainability of decentralised systems. Future research will build on these findings by integrating additional metrics and examining the influence of emerging consensus mechanisms.

Abstract: Grid-forming inverters control the power transfer between the AC and DC sides of an electrical grid while maintaining the frequency and voltage of the AC side. This paper focuses on ensuring large-signal stability of an electrical grid with inverter-interfaced renewable sources. We prove that the Hybrid-Angle Control (HAC) scheme for grid-forming inverters can exhibit incremental passivity properties between current and voltage at both the AC and DC ports. This incremental passivity can be certified through decentralized conditions. Inverters operating under HAC can, therefore, be connected to other passive elements (e.g. transmission lines) with an immediate guarantee of global transient stability regardless of the network topology or parameters. Passivity of Hybrid Angle Control is also preserved under small-signal (linearized) analyses, in contrast to conventional proportional droop laws that are passivity-short at low frequencies. Passivity and interconnected-stability properties are demonstrated through an example case study.

Abstract: Swarm intelligence traditionally refers to systems of simple, decentralized agents whose local interactions lead to emergent, collective behavior. Recently, the term 'swarm' has been extended to describe AI systems like OpenAI's Swarm, where large language models (LLMs) act as collaborative agents. This paper contrasts traditional swarm algorithms with LLM-driven swarms exploring how decentralization, scalability, and emergence are redefined in modern artificial intelligence (AI). We implement and compare both paradigms using Boids and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), evaluating latency, resource usage, and behavioral accuracy. The suitability of both cloud-based and local LLMs is assessed for the agent-based use in swarms. Although LLMs offer powerful reasoning and abstraction capabilities, they introduce new constraints in computation and coordination that challenge traditional notions of swarm design. This study highlights the opportunities and limitations of integrating LLMs into swarm systems and discusses the evolving definition of 'swarm' in modern AI research.

<title>Optimistic MEV in Ethereum Layer 2s: Why Blockspace Is Always in Demand</title>

Abstract: Layer 2 rollups are rapidly absorbing DeFi activity, securing over $40 billion and accounting for nearly half of Ethereum's DEX volume by Q1 2025, yet their MEV dynamics remain understudied. We address this gap by defining and quantifying optimistic MEV, a form of speculative, on-chain cyclic arbitrage whose detection and execution logic reside largely on-chain in smart contracts. As a result of their speculative nature and lack of off-chain opportunity verification, optimistic MEV transactions frequently fail to execute a profitable arbitrage.
  Applying our multi-stage identification pipeline to Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism, we find that in Q1 2025, optimistic MEV accounts for over 50% of on-chain gas on Base and Optimism and 7% on Arbitrum, driven mainly by "interaction" probes (on-chain computations searching for arbitrage). This speculative probing keeps blocks on Base and Optimism persistently full. Despite consuming over half of on-chain gas, optimistic MEV transactions pay less than one quarter of total gas fees. Cross-network comparison reveals divergent success rates, differing patterns of code reuse, and sensitivity to varying sequencer ordering and block production times. Finally, OLS regressions link optimistic MEV trade count to ETH volatility, retail trading activity, and DEX aggregator usage, showing how Layer 2 protocol parameters uniquely encourage speculative MEV.

Abstract: Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) faces increasing environmental scrutiny, particularly concerning the energy consumption of the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism and broader Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues. However, existing systematic literature reviews of DLT rely on limited analyses of citations, abstracts, and keywords, failing to fully capture the field's complexity and ESG concerns. We address these challenges by analyzing the full text of 24,539 publications using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with our manually labeled Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset of 39,427 entities for DLT. This methodology identified 505 key publications at the DLT/ESG intersection, enabling comprehensive domain analysis. Our combined NLP and temporal graph analysis reveals critical trends in DLT evolution and ESG impacts, including cryptography and peer-to-peer networks research's foundational influence, Bitcoin's persistent impact on research and environmental concerns (a "Lindy effect"), Ethereum's catalytic role on Proof of Stake (PoS) and smart contract adoption, and the industry's progressive shift toward energy-efficient consensus mechanisms. Our contributions include the first DLT-specific NER dataset addressing the scarcity of high-quality labeled NLP data in blockchain research, a methodology integrating NLP and temporal graph analysis for large-scale interdisciplinary literature reviews, and the first NLP-driven literature review focusing on DLT's ESG aspects.

Abstract: We introduce a compositional data-driven methodology with noisy data for designing fully-decentralized safety controllers applicable to large-scale interconnected networks, encompassing a vast number of subsystems with unknown mathematical models. Our compositional scheme leverages the interconnection topology and breaks down the network analysis into the examination of distinct subsystems. This is accompanied by utilizing a concept of control storage certificates (CSCs) to capture joint dissipativity-type properties among subsystems. These CSCs are instrumental in a compositional derivation of a control barrier certificate (CBC) specialized for the interconnected network, thereby ensuring its safety. In our data-driven scheme, we gather only a single noise-corrupted input-state trajectory from each unknown subsystem within a specified time frame. By fulfilling a specific rank condition, this process facilitates the construction of a CSC for each subsystem. Following this, by adhering to compositional dissipativity reasoning, we compose CSCs derived from noisy data and build a CBC for the unknown network, ensuring its safety over an infinite time horizon, while providing correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that our compositional data-driven approach significantly enhances the design of a CBC and its robust safety controller under noisy data across the interconnected network. This advancement is achieved by reducing the computational complexity from a polynomial growth in relation to network dimension, when using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization, to a linear scale based on the number of subsystems. We apply our data-driven findings to a variety of benchmarks, involving physical networks with unknown models and diverse interconnection topologies.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have experienced rapid advancements in recent years due to their ability to learn meaningful representations from graph data structures. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a viable machine learning approach for training a shared model on decentralized data, addressing privacy concerns while leveraging parallelism. Existing methods that address the unique requirements of federated GNN training using remote embeddings to enhance convergence accuracy are limited by their diminished performance due to large communication costs with a shared embedding server. In this paper, we present OpES, an optimized federated GNN training framework that uses remote neighbourhood pruning, and overlaps pushing of embeddings to the server with local training to reduce the network costs and training time. The modest drop in per-round accuracy due to pre-emptive push of embeddings is out-stripped by the reduction in per-round training time for large and dense graphs like Reddit and Products, converging up to $\approx2\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art technique using an embedding server and giving up to $20\%$ better accuracy than vanilla federated GNN learning.

Abstract: The evolution of smart cities demands scalable, secure, and energy-efficient architectures for real-time data processing. With the number of IoT devices expected to exceed 40 billion by 2030, traditional cloud-based systems are increasingly constrained by bandwidth, latency, and energy limitations. This paper leverages the ROOF (Real-time Onsite Operations Facilitation) framework with decentralized computing at intermediary fog and peripheral edge network layers to reduce latency by processing data near its point of origin. ROOF features fog caching to avoid redundancy, ultra-low-power wireless transmission for energy savings, and AI-driven resource allocation for efficiency. Security is enhanced through TLS encryption, blockchain-based authentication, and edge-level access control. Case studies from Bhubaneswar, Barcelona and Copenhagen validate the use of ROOF in traffic systems and environmental monitoring. The paper concludes by outlining key challenges and prospects of AI-driven analytics in smart urban infrastructure.

<title>Decentralized Decision Making in Two Sided Manufacturing-as-a-Service Marketplaces</title>

Abstract: Advancements in digitization have enabled two sided manufacturing-as-a-service (MaaS) marketplaces which has significantly reduced product development time for designers. These platforms provide designers with access to manufacturing resources through a network of suppliers and have instant order placement capabilities. Two key decision making levers are typically used to optimize the operations of these marketplaces: pricing and matching. The existing marketplaces operate in a centralized structure where they have complete control over decision making. However, a decentralized organization of the platform enables transparency of information across clients and suppliers. This dissertation focuses on developing tools for decision making enabling decentralization in MaaS marketplaces. In pricing mechanisms, a data driven method is introduced which enables small service providers to price services based on specific attributes of the services offered. A data mining method recommends a network based price to a supplier based on its attributes and the attributes of other suppliers on the platform. Three different approaches are considered for matching mechanisms. First, a reverse auction mechanism is introduced where designers bid for manufacturing services and the mechanism chooses a supplier which can match the bid requirements and stated price. The second approach uses mechanism design and mathematical programming to develop a stable matching mechanism for matching orders to suppliers based on their preferences. Empirical simulations are used to test the mechanisms in a simulated 3D printing marketplace and to evaluate the impact of stability on its performance. The third approach considers the matching problem in a dynamic and stochastic environment where demand (orders) and supply (supplier capacities) arrive over time and matching is performed online.

<title>IDOL: Improved Different Optimization Levels Testing for Solidity Compilers</title>

Abstract: As blockchain technology continues to evolve and mature, smart contracts have become a key driving force behind the digitization and automation of transactions. Smart contracts greatly simplify and refine the traditional business transaction processes, and thus have had a profound impact on various industries such as finance and supply chain management. However, because smart contracts cannot be modified once deployed, any vulnerabilities or design flaws within the contract cannot be easily fixed, potentially leading to significant financial losses or even legal issues. The compiler, as a critical component in the development process, directly affects the quality and security of smart contracts. This paper innovatively proposes a method, known as the Improved Different Optimization Levels (IDOL), for testing the Solidity compiler. The key idea behind IDOL is to perform reverse optimization transformations (i.e., change optimized form into unoptimized form) to generate semantically equivalent variants of the smart contracts under test, aiming to maximize the opportunities to trigger the optimization logic of compilers. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of IDOL and three confirmed compiler optimization bugs have been uncovered at the time of writing.

<title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning against Malicious Clients Based on Verifiable Functional Encryption</title>

Abstract: Federated learning is a promising distributed learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training without exposing local client data, thereby protect data privacy. However, it also brings new threats and challenges. The advancement of model inversion attacks has rendered the plaintext transmission of local models insecure, while the distributed nature of federated learning makes it particularly vulnerable to attacks raised by malicious clients. To protect data privacy and prevent malicious client attacks, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framework based on verifiable functional encryption, without a non-colluding dual-server setup or additional trusted third-party. Specifically, we propose a novel decentralized verifiable functional encryption (DVFE) scheme that enables the verification of specific relationships over multi-dimensional ciphertexts. This scheme is formally treated, in terms of definition, security model and security proof. Furthermore, based on the proposed DVFE scheme, we design a privacy-preserving federated learning framework VFEFL that incorporates a novel robust aggregation rule to detect malicious clients, enabling the effective training of high-accuracy models under adversarial settings. Finally, we provide formal analysis and empirical evaluation of the proposed schemes. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves the desired privacy protection, robustness, verifiability and fidelity, while eliminating the reliance on non-colluding dual-server settings or trusted third parties required by existing methods.

<title>Self-Stabilizing Replicated State Machine Coping with Byzantine and Recurring Transient Faults</title>

Abstract: The ability to perform repeated Byzantine agreement lies at the heart of important applications such as blockchain price oracles or replicated state machines. Any such protocol requires the following properties: (1) \textit{Byzantine fault-tolerance}, because not all participants can be assumed to be honest, (2) r\textit{ecurrent transient fault-tolerance}, because even honest participants may be subject to transient ``glitches'', (3) \textit{accuracy}, because the results of quantitative queries (such as price quotes) must lie within the interval of honest participants' inputs, and (4) \textit{self-stabilization}, because it is infeasible to reboot a distributed system following a fault.
  This paper presents the first protocol for repeated Byzantine agreement that satisfies the properties listed above. Specifically, starting in an arbitrary system configuration, our protocol establishes consistency. It preserves consistency in the face of up to $\lceil n/3 \rceil -1$ Byzantine participants {\em and} constant recurring (``noise'') transient faults, of up to $\lceil n/6 \rceil-1$ additional malicious transient faults, or even more than $\lceil n/6 \rceil-1$ (uniformly distributed) random transient faults, in each repeated Byzantine agreement.

<title>On Immutable Memory Systems for Artificial Agents: A Blockchain-Indexed Automata-Theoretic Framework Using ECDH-Keyed Merkle Chains</title>

arXiv:2506.13246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a formalised architecture for synthetic agents designed to retain immutable memory, verifiable reasoning, and constrained epistemic growth. Traditional AI systems rely on mutable, opaque statistical models prone to epistemic drift and historical revisionism. In contrast, we introduce the concept of the Merkle Automaton, a cryptographically anchored, deterministic computational framework that integrates formal automata theory with blockchain-based commitments. Each agent transition, memory fragment, and reasoning step is committed within a Merkle structure rooted on-chain, rendering it non-repudiable and auditably permanent. To ensure selective access and confidentiality, we derive symmetric encryption keys from ECDH exchanges contextualised by hierarchical privilege lattices. This enforces cryptographic access control over append-only DAG-structured knowledge graphs. Reasoning is constrained by formal logic systems and verified through deterministic traversal of policy-encoded structures. Updates are non-destructive and historied, preserving epistemic lineage without catastrophic forgetting. Zero-knowledge proofs facilitate verifiable, privacy-preserving inclusion attestations. Collectively, this architecture reframes memory not as a cache but as a ledger - one whose contents are enforced by protocol, bound by cryptography, and constrained by formal logic. The result is not an intelligent agent that mimics thought, but an epistemic entity whose outputs are provably derived, temporally anchored, and impervious to post hoc revision. This design lays foundational groundwork for legal, economic, and high-assurance computational systems that require provable memory, unforgeable provenance, and structural truth.

Abstract: Blockchain transactions consume diverse resources, foremost among them storage, but also computation, communication, and others. Efficiently charging for these resources is crucial for effective system resource allocation and long-term economic viability. The prevailing approach, one-dimensional pricing, sets a single price for a linear combination of resources. However, this often leads to under-utilization when resource capacities are limited. Multi-dimensional pricing, which independently prices each resource, offers an alternative but presents challenges in price discovery.
  This work focuses on the welfare achieved by these two schemes. We prove that multi-dimensional pricing is superior under stable blockchain conditions. Conversely, we show that one-dimensional pricing outperforms its multi-dimensional counterpart in transient states, exhibiting faster convergence and greater computational tractability. These results highlight a critical trade-off: while multi-dimensional pricing offers efficiency gains at equilibrium, its implementation incurs costs associated with system transitions. Our findings underscore the necessity for a deeper understanding of these transient effects before widespread adoption. Finally, we propose mechanisms that aim to mitigate some of these issues, paving the way for future research.

Abstract: Bitcoin is a representative decentralized currency system. For the security of Bitcoin, fairness in the distribution of mining rewards plays a crucial role in preventing the concentration of computational power in a few miners. Here, fairness refers to the distribution of block rewards in proportion to contributed computational resources. If miners with greater computational resources receive disproportionately higher rewards, i.e., if the Rich Get Richer (TRGR) phenomenon holds in Bitcoin, it indicates a threat to the system's decentralization. This study analyzes TRGR in Bitcoin by focusing on unintentional blockchain forks, an inherent phenomenon in Bitcoin. Previous research has failed to provide generalizable insights due to the low precision of their analytical methods. In contrast, we avoid this problem by adopting a method whose analytical precision has been empirically validated. The primary contribution of this work is a theoretical analysis that clearly demonstrates TRGR in Bitcoin under the assumption of fixed block propagation delays between different miners. More specifically, we show that the mining profit rate depends linearly on the proportion of hashrate. Furthermore, we examine the robustness of this result from multiple perspectives in scenarios where block propagation delays between different miners are not necessarily fixed.

<title>MARCO: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Conformal Prediction Filtering</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces MARCO (Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning with Conformal Optimization), a novel hardware-aware framework for efficient neural architecture search (NAS) targeting resource-constrained edge devices. By significantly reducing search time and maintaining accuracy under strict hardware constraints, MARCO bridges the gap between automated DNN design and CAD for edge AI deployment. MARCO's core technical contribution lies in its unique combination of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Conformal Prediction (CP) to accelerate the hardware/software co-design process for deploying deep neural networks. Unlike conventional once-for-all (OFA) supernet approaches that require extensive pretraining, MARCO decomposes the NAS task into a hardware configuration agent (HCA) and a Quantization Agent (QA). The HCA optimizes high-level design parameters, while the QA determines per-layer bit-widths under strict memory and latency budgets using a shared reward signal within a centralized-critic, decentralized-execution (CTDE) paradigm. A key innovation is the integration of a calibrated CP surrogate model that provides statistical guarantees (with a user-defined miscoverage rate) to prune unpromising candidate architectures before incurring the high costs of partial training or hardware simulation. This early filtering drastically reduces the search space while ensuring that high-quality designs are retained with a high probability. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that MARCO achieves a 3-4x reduction in total search time compared to an OFA baseline while maintaining near-baseline accuracy (within 0.3%). Furthermore, MARCO also reduces inference latency. Validation on a MAX78000 evaluation board confirms that simulator trends hold in practice, with simulator estimates deviating from measured values by less than 5%.

Abstract: Quantum communication is poised to become a foundational element of next-generation networking, offering transformative capabilities in security, entanglement-based connectivity, and computational offloading. However, the classical OSI model-designed for deterministic and error-tolerant systems-cannot support quantum-specific phenomena such as coherence fragility, probabilistic entanglement, and the no-cloning theorem. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and proposes an architectural redesign of the OSI model for quantum networks in the context of 7G. We introduce a Quantum-Converged OSI stack by extending the classical model with Layer 0 (Quantum Substrate) and Layer 8 (Cognitive Intent), supporting entanglement, teleportation, and semantic orchestration via LLMs and QML. Each layer is redefined to incorporate quantum mechanisms such as enhanced MAC protocols, fidelity-aware routing, and twin-based applications. This survey consolidates over 150 research works from IEEE, ACM, MDPI, arXiv, and Web of Science (2018-2025), classifying them by OSI layer, enabling technologies such as QKD, QEC, PQC, and RIS, and use cases such as satellite QKD, UAV swarms, and quantum IoT. A taxonomy of cross-layer enablers-such as hybrid quantum-classical control, metadata-driven orchestration, and blockchain-integrated quantum trust-is provided, along with simulation tools including NetSquid, QuNetSim, and QuISP. We present several domain-specific applications, including quantum healthcare telemetry, entangled vehicular networks, and satellite mesh overlays. An evaluation framework is proposed based on entropy throughput, coherence latency, and entanglement fidelity. Key future directions include programmable quantum stacks, digital twins, and AI-defined QNet agents, laying the groundwork for a scalable, intelligent, and quantum-compliant OSI framework for 7G and beyond.

Abstract: An abundance of recent impossibility results establish that regret minimization in Markov games with adversarial opponents is both statistically and computationally intractable. Nevertheless, none of these results preclude the possibility of regret minimization under the assumption that all parties adopt the same learning procedure. In this work, we present the first (to our knowledge) algorithm for learning in general-sum Markov games that provides sublinear regret guarantees when executed by all agents. The bounds we obtain are for swap regret, and thus, along the way, imply convergence to a correlated equilibrium. Our algorithm is decentralized, computationally efficient, and does not require any communication between agents. Our key observation is that online learning via policy optimization in Markov games essentially reduces to a form of weighted regret minimization, with unknown weights determined by the path length of the agents' policy sequence. Consequently, controlling the path length leads to weighted regret objectives for which sufficiently adaptive algorithms provide sublinear regret guarantees.

Abstract: Biometric recognition as an efficient and hard-to-forge way of identification and verification has become an indispensable part of the current digital world. The fast evolution of this technology has been a strong incentive for integration into many applications. Meanwhile, blockchain, the decentralized ledger technology, has been widely received by both research and industry in the past few years, and it is being increasingly deployed today in many different applications, such as money transfer, IoT, healthcare, or logistics. Recently, researchers have started to speculate on the pros and cons and what the best applications would be when these two technologies cross paths. This paper provides a survey of the research literature on the combination of blockchain and biometrics and includes a first legal analysis of this integration based on GDPR to shed light on challenges and potentials. Although the integration of blockchain technology into the biometric sector is still in its infancy, with a growing body of literature discussing specific applications and advanced technological setups, this paper aims to provide a holistic understanding of blockchain applicability in biometrics. Based on published studies, this article discusses, among others, practical examples combining blockchain and biometrics for novel applications in PKI systems, distributed trusted services, and identity management. Challenges and limitations when combining blockchain and biometrics that motivate future work will also be discussed; e.g., blockchain networks at their current stage may not be efficient or economical for some real-time biometric applications. Finally, we also discuss key legal aspects of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) related to this combination of technologies (blockchain and biometrics); for example, accountability, immutability, anonymity, and data protection elements.

Abstract: This paper leverages various philosophical and ontological frameworks to explore the concept of embodied artificial general intelligence (AGI), its relationship to human consciousness, and the key role of the metaverse in facilitating this relationship. Several theoretical frameworks underpin this exploration, such as embodied cognition, Michael Levin's computational boundary of a "Self," and Donald D. Hoffman's Interface Theory of Perception, which lead to considering human perceived outer reality as a symbolic representation of alternate inner states of being, and where AGI could embody a different form of consciousness with a larger computational boundary. The paper further discusses the necessary architecture for the emergence of an embodied AGI, how to calibrate an AGI's symbolic interface, and the key role played by the Metaverse, decentralized systems and open-source blockchain technology. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of achieving a certain degree of harmony in human relations and recognizing the interconnectedness of humanity at a global level, as key prerequisites for the emergence of a stable embodied AGI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have driven profound transformations in wireless networks. However, within wireless environments, the training of LLMs faces significant challenges related to security and privacy. Federated Learning (FL), with its decentralized architecture, offers enhanced data privacy protection. Nevertheless, when integrated with LLMs, FL still struggles with several critical limitations, including large-scale and heterogeneous data, resource-intensive training, and substantial communication overhead. To address these challenges, this paper first presents a systematic analysis of the distinct training stages of LLMs in wireless networks, including pre-training, instruction tuning, and alignment tuning. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Personalized Wireless Federated Fine-tuning (PWFF) framework. Initially, we utilize the adapter and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques to decrease energy consumption, while employing global partial aggregation to reduce communication delay. Subsequently, we develop two reward models and design a personalized loss function to fulfill the goal of personalized learning. Furthermore, we implement a local multi-objective alignment to ensure the stability and effectiveness of the FL process. Finally, we conduct a series of simulations to validate the performance of the proposed PWFF method and provide an in-depth discussion of the open issues.

Abstract: Graph coloring is fundamental to distributed computing. We give the first sub-logarithmic distributed algorithm for coloring cluster graphs. These graphs are obtained from the underlying communication network by contracting nodes and edges, and they appear frequently as components in the study of distributed algorithms. In particular, we give a $O(\log^* n)$-round algorithm to $(\Delta+1)$-color cluster graphs of at least polylogarithmic degree. The previous best bound known was $\operatorname{poly}(\log n)$ [Flin et al., SODA'24]. This properly generalizes results in the CONGEST model and shows that distributed graph problems can be solved quickly even when the node itself is decentralized.

Abstract: The agents in a Multi-Agent System (MAS) make observations about the system and send that information to a fusion center. The fusion center aggregates the information and concludes about the system parameters with as much accuracy as possible. However for the purposes of better efficiency of the system at large, the agents need to append some private parameters to the observed data. In this scenario, the data sent to the fusion center is faced with privacy risks. The data communicated to the fusion center must be secured against data privacy breaches and inference attacks in a decentralized manner. However, this in turn leads to a loss of utility of the data being sent to the fusion center. We quantify the utility and privacy of the system using Cosine similarity. We formulate our MAS problem in terms of deducing a concept for which compression-based methods are there in literature. Next, we propose a novel sanitization mechanism for our MAS using one such compression-based method while addressing the utility-privacy tradeoff problem.

Abstract: In many blockchains, e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the primary representation used for wallet addresses is a hardly memorable 40-digit hexadecimal string. As a result, users often select addresses from their recent transaction history, which enables blockchain address poisoning. The adversary first generates lookalike addresses similar to one with which the victim has previously interacted, and then engages with the victim to ``poison'' their transaction history. The goal is to have the victim mistakenly send tokens to the lookalike address, as opposed to the intended recipient. Compared to contemporary studies, this paper provides four notable contributions. First, we develop a detection system and perform measurements over two years on both Ethereum and BSC. We identify 13~times more attack attempts than reported previously -- totaling 270M on-chain attacks targeting 17M victims. 6,633 incidents have caused at least 83.8M USD in losses, which makes blockchain address poisoning one of the largest cryptocurrency phishing schemes observed in the wild. Second, we analyze a few large attack entities using improved clustering techniques, and model attacker profitability and competition. Third, we reveal attack strategies -- targeted populations, success conditions (address similarity, timing), and cross-chain attacks. Fourth, we mathematically define and simulate the lookalike address generation process across various software- and hardware-based implementations, and identify a large-scale attacker group that appears to use GPUs. We also discuss defensive countermeasures.

Abstract: This paper examines how synthetically generated faces and machine learning-based gender classification algorithms are affected by algorithmic lookism, the preferential treatment based on appearance. In experiments with 13,200 synthetically generated faces, we find that: (1) text-to-image (T2I) systems tend to associate facial attractiveness to unrelated positive traits like intelligence and trustworthiness; and (2) gender classification models exhibit higher error rates on "less-attractive" faces, especially among non-White women. These result raise fairness concerns regarding digital identity systems.

Abstract: We study the problem of uplink compression for cell-free multi-input multi-output networks with limited fronthaul capacity. In compress-forward mode, remote radio heads (RRHs) compress the received signal and forward it to a central unit for joint processing. While previous work has focused on a transform-based approach, which optimizes the transform matrix that reduces signals of high dimension to a static pre-determined lower dimension, we propose a rate-based approach that simultaneously finds both dimension and compression adaptively. Our approach accommodates for changes to network traffic and fronthaul limits. Using mutual information as the objective, we obtain the theoretical network capacity for adaptive compression and decouple the expression to enable decentralization. Furthermore, using channel statistics and user traffic density, we show different approaches to compute an efficient representation of side information that summarizes global channel state information and is shared with RRHs to assist compression. While keeping the information exchange overhead low, our decentralized implementation of adaptive compression shows competitive overall network performance compared to a centralized approach.

<title>Byzantine Outside, Curious Inside: Reconstructing Data Through Malicious Updates</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning without sharing raw data, allowing multiple clients to collaboratively learn a global model. However, studies reveal that privacy leakage is possible under commonly adopted FL protocols. In particular, a server with access to client gradients can synthesize data resembling the clients' training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel threat model in FL, named the maliciously curious client, where a client manipulates its own gradients with the goal of inferring private data from peers. This attacker uniquely exploits the strength of a Byzantine adversary, traditionally aimed at undermining model robustness, and repurposes it to facilitate data reconstruction attack. We begin by formally defining this novel client-side threat model and providing a theoretical analysis that demonstrates its ability to achieve significant reconstruction success during FL training. To demonstrate its practical impact, we further develop a reconstruction algorithm that combines gradient inversion with malicious update strategies. Our analysis and experimental results reveal a critical blind spot in FL defenses: both server-side robust aggregation and client-side privacy mechanisms may fail against our proposed attack. Surprisingly, standard server- and client-side defenses designed to enhance robustness or privacy may unintentionally amplify data leakage. Compared to the baseline approach, a mistakenly used defense may instead improve the reconstructed image quality by 10-15%.

Abstract: Blockchain-based software systems are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, yet a systematic understanding of their development challenges remains limited. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of 497,742 issues mined from 1,209 open-source blockchain projects hosted on GitHub. Employing BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, we identify 49 distinct issue topics and organize them hierarchically into 11 major subcategories. Our analysis reveals that both general software development issues and blockchain-specific concerns are nearly equally represented, with Wallet Management and UI Enhancement emerging as the most prominent topics. We further examine the temporal evolution of issue categories and resolution times, finding that Wallet issues not only dominate in frequency but also exhibit the longest resolution time. Conversely, Mechanisms issues are resolved significantly faster. Issue frequency surged after 2016 with the rise of Ethereum and decentralized applications, but declined after 2022. These findings enhance our understanding of blockchain software maintenance, informing the development of specialized tools and practices to improve robustness and maintainability.

Abstract: A core learning challenge for existed Foundation Models (FM) is striking the tradeoff between generalization with personalization, which is a dilemma that has been highlighted by various parameter-efficient adaptation techniques. Federated foundation models (FFM) provide a structural means to decouple shared knowledge from individual specific adaptations via decentralized processes. Recommendation systems offer a perfect testbed for FFMs, given their reliance on rich implicit feedback reflecting unique user characteristics. This position paper discusses a novel learning paradigm where FFMs not only harness their generalization capabilities but are specifically designed to preserve the integrity of user personality, illustrated thoroughly within the recommendation contexts. We envision future personal agents, powered by personalized adaptive FMs, guiding user decisions on content. Such an architecture promises a user centric, decentralized system where individuals maintain control over their personalized agents.

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is a collaborative machine learning framework for training a model across participants without a central server or raw data exchange. DFL faces challenges due to statistical heterogeneity, as participants often possess data of different distributions reflecting local environments and user behaviors. Recent work has shown that the neural tangent kernel (NTK) approach, when applied to federated learning in a centralized framework, can lead to improved performance. We propose an approach leveraging the NTK to train client models in the decentralized setting, while introducing a synergy between NTK-based evolution and model averaging. This synergy exploits inter-client model deviation and improves both accuracy and convergence in heterogeneous settings. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves higher accuracy than baselines in highly heterogeneous settings, where other approaches often underperform. Additionally, it reaches target performance in 4.6 times fewer communication rounds. We validate our approach across multiple datasets, network topologies, and heterogeneity settings to ensure robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Noncooperative multi-agent systems often face coordination challenges due to conflicting preferences among agents. In particular, agents acting in their own self-interest can settle on different equilibria, leading to suboptimal outcomes or even safety concerns. We propose an algorithm named trading auction for consensus (TACo), a decentralized approach that enables noncooperative agents to reach consensus without communicating directly or disclosing private valuations. TACo facilitates coordination through a structured trading-based auction, where agents iteratively select choices of interest and provably reach an agreement within an a priori bounded number of steps. A series of numerical experiments validate that the termination guarantees of TACo hold in practice, and show that TACo achieves a median performance that minimizes the total cost across all agents, while allocating resources significantly more fairly than baseline approaches.

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service (SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity, and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm capacities.

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering), a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled. DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance.

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos (ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However, the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10 different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a privacy-preserving technique for collaborative model training across heterogeneously distributed silos. Yet, its reliance on a single central server introduces potential bottlenecks and risks of single-point failure. Decentralizing the server, often referred to as decentralized learning, addresses this problem by distributing the server role across nodes within the network. One drawback regarding this pure decentralization is it introduces communication inefficiencies, which arise from increased message exchanges in large-scale setups. However, existing proposed solutions often fail to simulate the real-world distributed and decentralized environment in their experiments, leading to unreliable performance evaluations and limited applicability in practice. Recognizing the lack from prior works, this work investigates the correlation between model size and network latency, a critical factor in optimizing decentralized learning communication. We propose a graph-based gossiping mechanism, where specifically, minimum spanning tree and graph coloring are used to optimize network structure and scheduling for efficient communication across various network topologies and message capacities. Our approach configures and manages subnetworks on real physical routers and devices and closely models real-world distributed setups. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves communication, compatible with different topologies and data sizes, reducing bandwidth and transfer time by up to circa 8 and 4.4 times, respectively, compared to naive flooding broadcasting methods.

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) technology has advanced during the past years, and it is now used for several applications that require vehicles to exchange real-time data, such as in traffic information management. Traditionally, road traffic information has been collected using on-site sensors. However, crowd-sourcing traffic information from onboard sensors or smartphones has become a viable alternative. State-of-the-art solutions currently follow a centralized model where only the service provider has complete access to the collected traffic data and represent a single point of failure and trust. In this paper, we propose GOLIATH, a blockchain-based decentralized framework that runs on the In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system to collect real-time information exchanged between the network's participants. Our approach mitigates the limitations of existing crowd-sourcing centralized solutions by guaranteeing trusted information collection and exchange, fully exploiting the intrinsic distributed nature of vehicles. We demonstrate its feasibility in the context of vehicle positioning and traffic information management. Each vehicle participating in the decentralized network shares its position and neighbors' ones in the form of a transaction recorded on the ledger, which uses a novel consensus mechanism to validate it. We design the consensus mechanism resilient against a realistic set of adversaries that aim to tamper or disable the communication. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated (but realistic) environment, which considers different threats and allows showing its robustness and safety properties.

Abstract: We study learnability of mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium (NE) in general finite games using higher-order replicator dynamics as well as classes of higher-order uncoupled heterogeneous dynamics. In higher-order uncoupled learning dynamics, players have no access to utilities of opponents (uncoupled) but are allowed to use auxiliary states to further process information (higher-order). We establish a link between uncoupled learning and feedback stabilization with decentralized control. Using this association, we show that for any finite game with an isolated completely mixed-strategy NE, there exist higher-order uncoupled learning dynamics that lead (locally) to that NE. We further establish the lack of universality of learning dynamics by linking learning to the control theoretic concept of simultaneous stabilization. We construct two games such that any higher-order dynamics that learn the completely mixed-strategy NE of one of these games can never learn the completely mixed-strategy NE of the other. Next, motivated by imposing natural restrictions on allowable learning dynamics, we introduce the Asymptotic Best Response (ABR) property. Dynamics with the ABR property asymptotically learn a best response in environments that are asymptotically stationary. We show that the ABR property relates to an internal stability condition on higher-order learning dynamics. We provide conditions under which NE are compatible with the ABR property. Finally, we address learnability of mixed-strategy NE in the bandit setting using a bandit version of higher-order replicator dynamics.

Abstract: Urban digital twins are increasingly perceived as a way to pool the growing digital resources of cities for the purpose of a more sustainable and integrated urban planning. Models and simulations are central to this undertaking: They enable "what if?" scenarios, create insights and describe relationships between the vast data that is being collected. However, the process of integrating and subsequently using models in urban digital twins is an inherently complex undertaking. It raises questions about how to represent urban complexity, how to deal with uncertain assUrban Model Platformtions and modeling paradigms, and how to capture underlying power relations. Existent approaches in the domain largely focus on monolithic and centralized solutions in the tradition of neoliberal city-making, oftentimes prohibiting pluralistic and open interoperable models. Using a participatory design for participatory systems approach together with the City of Hamburg, Germany, we find that an open Urban Model Platform can function both as a public technological backbone for modeling and simulation in urban digital twins and as a socio-technical framework for a collaborative and pluralistic representation of urban processes. Such a platform builds on open standards, allows for a decentralized integration of models, enables communication between models and supports a multi-model approach to representing urban systems.

Abstract: Discriminative unsupervised learning methods such as contrastive learning have demonstrated the ability to learn generalized visual representations on centralized data. It is nonetheless challenging to adapt such methods to a distributed system with unlabeled, private, and heterogeneous client data due to user styles and preferences. Federated learning enables multiple clients to collectively learn a global model without provoking any privacy breach between local clients. On the other hand, another direction of federated learning studies personalized methods to address the local heterogeneity. However, work on solving both generalization and personalization without labels in a decentralized setting remains unfamiliar. In this work, we propose a novel method, FedStyle, to learn a more generalized global model by infusing local style information with local content information for contrastive learning, and to learn more personalized local models by inducing local style information for downstream tasks. The style information is extracted by contrasting original local data with strongly augmented local data (Sobel filtered images). Through extensive experiments with linear evaluations in both IID and non-IID settings, we demonstrate that FedStyle outperforms both the generalization baseline methods and personalization baseline methods in a stylized decentralized setting. Through comprehensive ablations, we demonstrate our design of style infusion and stylized personalization improve performance significantly.

<title>A Stochastic Hybrid Approach to Decentralized Networked Control: Stochastic Network Delays and Poisson Pulsing Attacks</title>

Abstract: By designing the decentralized time-regularized (Zeno-free) event-triggered strategies for the state-feedback control law, this paper considers the stochastic stabilization of a class of networked control systems, where two sources of randomness exist in multiple decentralized networks that operate asynchronously and independently: the communication channels are constrained by the stochastic network delays and also by Poisson pulsing denial-of-service (Pp-DoS) attacks. The time delay in the network denotes the length from a transmission instant to the corresponding update instant, and is supposed to be a continuous random variable subject to certain continuous probability distribution; while the attacks' cardinal number is a discrete random variable supposed to be subject to Poisson distribution, so the inter-attack time, i.e., the time between two consecutive attack instants, is subject to exponential distribution. The considered system is modeled as a stochastic hybrid formalism, where the randomness enters through the jump map into the reset value (the inter-attack time directly related) of each triggered strategy. By only sampling/transmitting state measurements when needed and simultaneously by taking the specific medium access protocols into account, the designed event-triggered strategies are synthesized in a state-based and decentralized form, which are robust (tolerable well) to stochastic network delays, under different tradeoff-conditions between the minimum inter-event times, maximum allowable delays (i.e., potentially tolerable delays) and the frequencies of attacks. Using stochastic hybrid tools to combine attack-active parts with attack-over parts, the designed triggered strategies, if designed well according to the actual system needs, can tolerate (be resilient to) the Pp-DoS attacks and stochastic network delays without jeopardizing the stability and Zeno-freeness.

Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems play an important role in next generation communication networks due to their ability to provide extensive global coverage with guaranteed communications in remote areas and isolated areas where base stations cannot be cost-efficiently deployed. With the pervasive adoption of LEO satellite systems, especially in the LEO Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenarios, their spectrum resource management requirements have become more complex as a result of massive service requests and high bandwidth demand from terrestrial terminals. For instance, when leasing the spectrum to terrestrial users and controlling the uplink transmit power, satellites collect user data for machine learning purposes, which usually are sensitive information such as location, budget and quality of service (QoS) requirement. To facilitate model training in LEO IoT while preserving the privacy of data, blockchain-driven federated learning (FL) is widely used by leveraging on a fully decentralized architecture. In this paper, we propose a hybrid spectrum pricing and power control framework for LEO IoT by combining blockchain technology and FL. We first design a local deep reinforcement learning algorithm for LEO satellite systems to learn a revenue-maximizing pricing and power control scheme. Then the agents collaborate to form a FL system. We also propose a reputation-based blockchain which is used in the global model aggregation phase of FL. Based on the reputation mechanism, a node is selected for each global training round to perform model aggregation and block generation, which can further enhance the decentralization of the network and guarantee the trust. Simulation tests are conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed scheme. Our results show the efficiency of finding the maximum revenue scheme for LEO satellite systems while preserving the privacy of each agent.

Abstract: The randomized power method has gained significant interest due to its simplicity and efficient handling of large-scale spectral analysis and recommendation tasks. However, its application to large datasets containing personal information (e.g., web interactions, search history, personal tastes) raises critical privacy problems. This paper addresses these issues by proposing enhanced privacy-preserving variants of the method. First, we propose a variant that reduces the amount of the noise required in current techniques to achieve Differential Privacy (DP). More precisely, we refine the privacy analysis so that the Gaussian noise variance no longer grows linearly with the target rank, achieving the same DP guarantees with strictly less noise. Second, we adapt our method to a decentralized framework in which data is distributed among multiple users. The decentralized protocol strengthens privacy guarantees with no accuracy penalty and a low computational and communication overhead. Our results include the provision of tighter convergence bounds for both the centralized and decentralized versions, and an empirical comparison with previous work using real recommendation datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of an enhanced asynchronous AdaBoost framework for federated learning (FL), focusing on its application across five distinct domains: computer vision on edge devices, blockchain-based model transparency, on-device mobile personalization, IoT anomaly detection, and federated healthcare diagnostics. The proposed algorithm incorporates adaptive communication scheduling and delayed weight compensation to reduce synchronization frequency and communication overhead while preserving or improving model accuracy. We examine how these innovations improve communication efficiency, scalability, convergence, and robustness in each domain. Comparative metrics including training time, communication overhead, convergence iterations, and classification accuracy are evaluated using data and estimates derived from Oghlukyan's enhanced AdaBoost framework. Empirical results show, for example, training time reductions on the order of 20-35% and communication overhead reductions of 30-40% compared to baseline AdaBoost, with convergence achieved in significantly fewer boosting rounds. Tables and charts summarize these improvements by domain. Mathematical formulations of the adaptive scheduling rule and error-driven synchronization thresholds are provided. Overall, the enhanced AdaBoost exhibits markedly improved efficiency and robustness across diverse FL scenarios, suggesting broad applicability of the approach.

Abstract: The Intelligent System of Emergent Knowledge (ISEK) establishes a decentralized network where human and artificial intelligence agents collaborate as peers, forming a self-organizing cognitive ecosystem. Built on Web3 infrastructure, ISEK combines three fundamental principles: (1) a decentralized multi-agent architecture resistant to censorship, (2) symbiotic AI-human collaboration with equal participation rights, and (3) resilient self-adaptation through distributed consensus mechanisms.
  The system implements an innovative coordination protocol featuring a six-phase workflow (Publish, Discover, Recruit, Execute, Settle, Feedback) for dynamic task allocation, supported by robust fault tolerance and a multidimensional reputation system. Economic incentives are governed by the native $ISEK token, facilitating micropayments, governance participation, and reputation tracking, while agent sovereignty is maintained through NFT-based identity management.
  This synthesis of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and incentive engineering creates an infrastructure that actively facilitates emergent intelligence. ISEK represents a paradigm shift from conventional platforms, enabling the organic development of large-scale, decentralized cognitive systems where autonomous agents collectively evolve beyond centralized constraints.

Abstract: Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) is a rapidly proliferating e-commerce model, offering consumers to get the product immediately and defer payments. Meanwhile, emerging blockchain technologies endow BNPL platforms with digital currency transactions, allowing BNPL platforms to integrate with digital wallets. However, the transparency of transactions causes critical privacy concerns because malicious participants may derive consumers' financial statuses from on-chain asynchronous payments. Furthermore, the newly created transactions for deferred payments introduce additional time overheads, which weaken the scalability of BNPL services. To address these issues, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving blockchain-based asynchronous payment scheme (Epass), which has promising scalability while protecting the privacy of on-chain consumer transactions. Specifically, Epass leverages locally verifiable signatures to guarantee the privacy of consumer transactions against malicious acts. Then, a privacy-preserving asynchronous payment scheme can be further constructed by leveraging time-release encryption to control trapdoors of redactable blockchain, reducing time overheads by modifying transactions for deferred payment. We give formal definitions and security models, generic structures, and formal proofs for Epass. Extensive comparisons and experimental analysis show that \textsf{Epass} achieves KB-level communication costs, and reduces time overhead by more than four times in comparisons with locally verifiable signatures and Go-Ethereum private test networks.

<title>Generalization Error Analysis for Attack-Free and Byzantine-Resilient Decentralized Learning with Data Heterogeneity</title>

Abstract: Decentralized learning, which facilitates joint model training across geographically scattered agents, has gained significant attention in the field of signal and information processing in recent years. While the optimization errors of decentralized learning algorithms have been extensively studied, their generalization errors remain relatively under-explored. As the generalization errors reflect the scalability of trained models on unseen data and are crucial in determining the performance of trained models in real-world applications, understanding the generalization errors of decentralized learning is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present fine-grained generalization error analysis for both attack-free and Byzantine-resilient decentralized learning with heterogeneous data as well as under mild assumptions, in contrast to prior studies that consider homogeneous data and/or rely on a stringent bounded stochastic gradient assumption. Our results shed light on the impact of data heterogeneity, model initialization and stochastic gradient noise -- factors that have not been closely investigated before -- on the generalization error of decentralized learning. We also reveal that Byzantine attacks performed by malicious agents largely affect the generalization error, and their negative impact is inherently linked to the data heterogeneity while remaining independent on the sample size. Numerical experiments on both convex and non-convex tasks are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.

<title>On the Performance of Cloud-based ARM SVE for Zero-Knowledge Proving Systems</title>

Abstract: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) are becoming a gold standard in scaling blockchains and bringing Web3 to life. At the same time, ZKP for transactions running on the Ethereum Virtual Machine require powerful servers with hundreds of CPU cores. The current zkProver implementation from Polygon is optimized for x86-64 CPUs by vectorizing key operations, such as Merkle tree building with Poseidon hashes over the Goldilocks field, with Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX and AVX512). With these optimizations, a ZKP for a batch of transactions is generated in less than two minutes. With the advent of cloud servers with ARM which are at least 10% cheaper than x86-64 servers and the implementation of ARM Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), we wonder if ARM servers can take over their x86-64 counterparts. Unfortunately, our analysis shows that current ARM CPUs are not a match for their x86-64 competitors. Graviton4 from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Axion from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are 1.6X and 1.4X slower compared to the latest AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon servers from AWS with AVX and AVX512, respectively, when building a Merkle tree with over four million leaves. This low performance is due to (1) smaller vector size in these ARM CPUs (128 bits versus 512 bits in AVX512) and (2) lower clock frequency. On the other hand, ARM SVE/SVE2 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is at least as powerful as AVX/AVX512 but more flexible. Moreover, we estimate that increasing the vector size to 512 bits will enable higher performance in ARM CPUs compared to their x86-64 counterparts while maintaining their price advantage.

Abstract: The computing continuum introduces new challenges for access control due to its dynamic, distributed, and heterogeneous nature. In this paper, we propose a Zero-Trust (ZT) access control solution that leverages decentralized identification and authentication mechanisms based on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Additionally, we employ Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC) to define policies that capture the evolving trust relationships inherent in the continuum. Through a proof-of-concept implementation, we demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our solution, highlighting its potential to enhance security and trust in decentralized environments.

Abstract: Technical debt refers to suboptimal code that degrades software quality. When developers intentionally introduce such debt, it is called self-admitted technical debt (SATD). Since SATD hinders maintenance, identifying its categories is key to uncovering quality issues. Traditionally, constructing such taxonomies requires manually inspecting SATD comments and surrounding code, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often inconsistent due to annotator subjectivity. This study presents ASTAGEN, an initial step toward automating SATD taxonomy generation using large language models (LLMs). Given a comment and its surrounding code, ASTAGEN first generates a concise explanation for each SATD comment, then incrementally generates and updates categories to construct a taxonomy. We evaluate ASTAGEN on SATD datasets from three domains: quantum software, smart contracts, and machine learning. It successfully recovers domain-specific categories reported in prior work, such as Layer Configuration in machine learning. Compared to a naive use of an LLM, ASTAGEN produces more consistent category assignments due to its explanation-driven, iterative design. It also completes taxonomy generation in under two hours and for less than one USD, even on the largest dataset. These results suggest that while full automation remains challenging, ASTAGEN is able to support semi-automated taxonomy construction. Furthermore, our work opens up avenues for future work, such as automatic taxonomy generation in other areas.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables the training of machine learning models across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, the presence of anomalous or corrupted clients - such as those with faulty sensors or non representative data distributions - can significantly degrade model performance. Detecting such clients without accessing raw data remains a key challenge. We propose WAFFLE (Wavelet and Fourier representations for Federated Learning) a detection algorithm that labels malicious clients {\it before training}, using locally computed compressed representations derived from either the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) or the Fourier Transform. Both approaches provide low-dimensional, task-agnostic embeddings suitable for unsupervised client separation. A lightweight detector, trained on a distillated public dataset, performs the labeling with minimal communication and computational overhead. While both transforms enable effective detection, WST offers theoretical advantages, such as non-invertibility and stability to local deformations, that make it particularly well-suited to federated scenarios. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method improves detection accuracy and downstream classification performance compared to existing FL anomaly detection algorithms, validating its effectiveness as a pre-training alternative to online detection strategies.

Abstract: This paper proposes Load-aware Tram-FL, an extension of Tram-FL that introduces a training scheduling mechanism to minimize total training time in decentralized federated learning by accounting for both computational and communication loads. The scheduling problem is formulated as a global optimization task, which-though intractable in its original form-is made solvable by decomposing it into node-wise subproblems. To promote balanced data utilization under non-IID distributions, a variance constraint is introduced, while the overall training latency, including both computation and communication costs, is minimized through the objective function. Simulation results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that Load-aware Tram-FL significantly reduces training time and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Recent work has shown both how to augment Snowman with a `liveness' module called `Frosty' that protects against liveness attacks, and also how to modify Snowman so as to be consistent in partial synchrony. Since Frosty assumes (a strong form of) synchrony, the aim of this note is to show how to modify Frosty to deal with the partially synchronous version of Snowman.

Abstract: In decentralized cooperative multi-armed bandits (MAB), each agent observes a distinct stream of rewards, and seeks to exchange information with others to select a sequence of arms so as to minimize its regret. Agents in the cooperative setting can outperform a single agent running a MAB method such as Upper-Confidence Bound (UCB) independently. In this work, we study how to recover such salient behavior when an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, that is, communicate arbitrarily wrong information in the form of reward mean-estimates or confidence sets. This framework can be used to model attackers in computer networks, instigators of offensive content into recommender systems, or manipulators of financial markets. Our key contribution is the development of a fully decentralized resilient upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm that fuses an information mixing step among agents with a truncation of inconsistent and extreme values. This truncation step enables us to establish that the performance of each normal agent is no worse than the classic single-agent UCB1 algorithm in terms of regret, and more importantly, the cumulative regret of all normal agents is strictly better than the non-cooperative case, provided that each agent has at least 3f+1 neighbors where f is the maximum possible Byzantine agents in each agent's neighborhood. Extensions to time-varying neighbor graphs, and minimax lower bounds are further established on the achievable regret. Experiments corroborate the merits of this framework in practice.

Abstract: Prevailing accounts in both multi-agent AI and the social sciences explain social structure through top-down abstractions-such as institutions, norms, or trust-yet lack simulateable models of how such structures emerge from individual behavior. Ethnographic and archaeological evidence suggests that reciprocity served as the foundational mechanism of early human societies, enabling economic circulation, social cohesion, and interpersonal obligation long before the rise of formal institutions. Modern financial systems such as credit and currency can likewise be viewed as scalable extensions of reciprocity, formalizing exchange across time and anonymity. Building on this insight, we argue that reciprocity is not merely a local or primitive exchange heuristic, but the scalable substrate from which large-scale social structures can emerge. We propose a three-stage framework to model this emergence: reciprocal dynamics at the individual level, norm stabilization through shared expectations, and the construction of durable institutional patterns. This approach offers a cognitively minimal, behaviorally grounded foundation for simulating how large-scale social systems can emerge from decentralized reciprocal interaction.

Abstract: Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), which blend neural networks with physical differential equations, have emerged as a powerful framework for scientific machine learning (SciML), enabling data-efficient, interpretable, and physically consistent modeling. In the context of smart grid systems, modeling node-wise battery dynamics remains a challenge due to the stochasticity of solar input and variability in household load profiles. Traditional approaches often struggle with generalization and fail to capture unmodeled residual dynamics. This work proposes a UDE-based approach to learn node-specific battery evolution by embedding a neural residual into a physically inspired battery ODE. Synthetic yet realistic solar generation and load demand data are used to simulate battery dynamics over time. The neural component learns to model unobserved or stochastic corrections arising from heterogeneity in node demand and environmental conditions. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the trained UDE aligns closely with ground truth battery trajectories, exhibits smooth convergence behavior, and maintains stability in long-term forecasts. These findings affirm the viability of UDE-based SciML approaches for battery modeling in decentralized energy networks and suggest broader implications for real-time control and optimization in renewable-integrated smart grids.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal vision-language-action (VLA) models have revolutionized traditional robot learning, enabling systems to interpret vision, language, and action in unified frameworks for complex task planning. However, mastering complex manipulation tasks remains an open challenge, constrained by limitations in persistent contextual memory, multi-agent coordination under uncertainty, and dynamic long-horizon planning across variable sequences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{HiBerNAC}, a \textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{B}rain-\textbf{e}mulated \textbf{r}obotic \textbf{N}eural \textbf{A}gent \textbf{C}ollective, inspired by breakthroughs in neuroscience, particularly in neural circuit mechanisms and hierarchical decision-making. Our framework combines: (1) multimodal VLA planning and reasoning with (2) neuro-inspired reflection and multi-agent mechanisms, specifically designed for complex robotic manipulation tasks. By leveraging neuro-inspired functional modules with decentralized multi-agent collaboration, our approach enables robust and enhanced real-time execution of complex manipulation tasks. In addition, the agentic system exhibits scalable collective intelligence via dynamic agent specialization, adapting its coordination strategy to variable task horizons and complexity. Through extensive experiments on complex manipulation tasks compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, we demonstrate that \textbf{HiBerNAC} reduces average long-horizon task completion time by 23\%, and achieves non-zero success rates (12\textendash 31\%) on multi-path tasks where prior state-of-the-art VLA models consistently fail. These results provide indicative evidence for bridging biological cognition and robotic learning mechanisms.

Abstract: An increasing number of DeFi protocols are gaining popularity, facilitating transactions among multiple anonymous users. State Manipulation is one of the notorious attacks in DeFi smart contracts, with price variable being the most commonly exploited state variable-attackers manipulate token prices to gain illicit profits. In this paper, we propose PriceSleuth, a novel method that leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) and static analysis to detect Price Manipulation (PM) attacks proactively. PriceSleuth firstly identifies core logic function related to price calculation in DeFi contracts. Then it guides LLM to locate the price calculation code statements. Secondly, PriceSleuth performs backward dependency analysis of price variables, instructing LLM in detecting potential price manipulation. Finally, PriceSleuth utilizes propagation analysis of price variables to assist LLM in detecting whether these variables are maliciously exploited. We presented preliminary experimental results to substantiate the effectiveness of PriceSleuth . And we outline future research directions for PriceSleuth.

Abstract: Blockchain and edge computing are two instrumental paradigms of decentralized computation, driving key advancements in Smart Cities applications such as supply chain, energy and mobility. Despite their unprecedented impact on society, they remain significantly fragmented as technologies and research areas, while they share fundamental principles of distributed systems and domains of applicability. This paper introduces a novel and large-scale systematic literature review on the nexus of blockchain and edge computing with the aim to unravel a new understanding of how the interfacing of the two computing paradigms can boost innovation to provide solutions to timely but also long-standing research challenges. By collecting almost 6000 papers from 3 databases and putting under scrutiny almost 1000 papers, we build a novel taxonomy and classification consisting of 22 features with 287 attributes that we study using quantitative and machine learning methods. They cover a broad spectrum of technological, design, epistemological and sustainability aspects. Results reveal 4 distinguishing patterns of interplay between blockchain and edge computing with key determinants the public (permissionless) vs. private (permissioned) design, technology and proof of concepts. They also demonstrate the prevalence of blockchain-assisted edge computing for improving privacy and security, in particular for mobile computing applications.

<title>DIsoN: Decentralized Isolation Networks for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Medical Imaging</title>

Abstract: Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test samples and the training data distribution to identify differences. State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This is because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound, histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of their training data for OOD detection services. Code will be available upon acceptance at: *****

Abstract: Rapid search and rescue is critical to maximizing survival rates following natural disasters. However, these efforts are challenged by the need to search large disaster zones, lack of reliability in the communications infrastructure, and a priori unknown numbers of objects of interest (OOIs), such as injured survivors. Aerial robots are increasingly being deployed for search and rescue due to their high mobility, but there remains a gap in deploying multi-robot autonomous aerial systems for methodical search of large environments. Prior works have relied on preprogrammed paths from human operators or are evaluated only in simulation. We bridge these gaps in the state of the art by developing and demonstrating a decentralized active search system, which biases its trajectories to take additional views of uncertain OOIs. The methodology leverages stochasticity for rapid coverage in communication denied scenarios. When communications are available, robots share poses, goals, and OOI information to accelerate the rate of search. Detections from multiple images and vehicles are fused to provide a mean and covariance for each OOI location. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments in Bloomingdale, OH, are conducted to validate the approach. The results demonstrate the active search approach outperforms greedy coverage-based planning in communication-denied scenarios while maintaining comparable performance in communication-enabled scenarios. The results also demonstrate the ability to detect and localize all a priori unknown OOIs with a mean error of approximately 3m at flight altitudes between 50m-60m.

<title>Evolutionary model for energy trading in community microgrids using Hawk-Dove strategies</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized model of energy cooperation between microgrids, in which decisions are made locally, at the level of the microgrid community. Each microgrid is modeled as an autonomous agent that adopts a Hawk or Dove strategy, depending on the level of energy stored in the battery and its role in the energy trading process. The interactions between selling and buying microgrids are modeled through an evolutionary algorithm. An individual in the algorithm population is represented as an energy trading matrix that encodes the amounts of energy traded between the selling and buying microgrids. The population evolution is achieved by recombination and mutation operators. Recombination uses a specialized operator for matrix structures, and mutation is applied to the matrix elements according to a Gaussian distribution. The evaluation of an individual is made with a multi-criteria fitness function that considers the seller profit, the degree of energy stability at the community level, penalties for energy imbalance at the community level and for the degradation of microgrids batteries. The method was tested on a simulated scenario with 100 microgrids, each with its own selling and buying thresholds, to reflect a realistic environment with variable storage characteristics of microgrids batteries. By applying the algorithm on this scenario, 95 out of the 100 microgrids reached a stable energy state. This result confirms the effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving energy balance both at the individual level, for each microgrid, and at the level of the entire community.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized fields such as natural language processing and computer vision by enabling general-purpose learning across diverse tasks and datasets. However, building analogous models for human mobility remains challenging due to the privacy-sensitive nature of mobility data and the resulting data silos across institutions. To bridge this gap, we propose MoveGCL, a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for training mobility foundation models via generative continual learning. Without sharing raw data, MoveGCL enables decentralized and progressive model evolution by replaying synthetic trajectories generated from a frozen teacher model, and reinforces knowledge retention through a tailored distillation strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. To address the heterogeneity of mobility patterns, MoveGCL incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer with a mobility-aware expert routing mechanism, and employs a layer-wise progressive adaptation strategy to stabilize continual updates. Experiments on six real-world urban datasets demonstrate that MoveGCL achieves performance comparable to joint training and significantly outperforms federated learning baselines, while offering strong privacy protection. MoveGCL marks a crucial step toward unlocking foundation models for mobility, offering a practical blueprint for open, scalable, and privacy-preserving model development in the era of foundation models.

Abstract: The rapid global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has established electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) as a critical component of smart grid infrastructure. While essential for ensuring reliable energy delivery and accessibility, EVSE systems face significant cybersecurity challenges, including network reconnaissance, backdoor intrusions, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. These emerging threats, driven by the interconnected and autonomous nature of EVSE, require innovative and adaptive security mechanisms that go beyond traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS). Existing approaches, whether network-based or host-based, often fail to detect sophisticated and targeted attacks specifically crafted to exploit new vulnerabilities in EVSE infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel intrusion detection framework that leverages multimodal data sources, including network traffic and kernel events, to identify complex attack patterns. The framework employs a distributed learning approach, enabling collaborative intelligence across EVSE stations while preserving data privacy through federated learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing solutions, achieving a detection rate above 98% and a precision rate exceeding 97% in decentralized environments. This solution addresses the evolving challenges of EVSE security, offering a scalable and privacypreserving response to advanced cyber threats

Abstract: Smart contracts, integral to blockchain ecosystems, enable decentralized applications to execute predefined operations without intermediaries. Their ability to enforce trustless interactions has made them a core component of platforms such as Ethereum. Vulnerabilities such as numerical overflows, reentrancy attacks, and improper access permissions have led to the loss of millions of dollars throughout the blockchain and smart contract sector. Traditional smart contract auditing techniques such as manual code reviews and formal verification face limitations in scalability, automation, and adaptability to evolving development patterns. As a result, AI-based solutions have emerged as a promising alternative, offering the ability to learn complex patterns, detect subtle flaws, and provide scalable security assurances. This paper examines novel AI-driven techniques for vulnerability detection in smart contracts, focusing on machine learning, deep learning, graph neural networks, and transformer-based models. This paper analyzes how each technique represents code, processes semantic information, and responds to real world vulnerability classes. We also compare their strengths and weaknesses in terms of accuracy, interpretability, computational overhead, and real time applicability. Lastly, it highlights open challenges and future opportunities for advancing this domain.

Abstract: Decentralized optimization is crucial for multi-agent systems, with significant concerns about communication efficiency and privacy. This paper explores the role of efficient communication in decentralized stochastic gradient descent algorithms for enhancing privacy preservation. We develop a novel algorithm that incorporates two key features: random agent activation and sparsified communication. Utilizing differential privacy, we demonstrate that these features reduce noise without sacrificing privacy, thereby amplifying the privacy guarantee and improving accuracy. Additionally, we analyze the convergence and the privacy-accuracy-communication trade-off of the proposed algorithm. Finally, we present experimental results to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

Abstract: The Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms is a simple Python FL framework that is easy to use by ML&amp;AI developers who do not need to be professional programmers and is also amenable to LLMs. In the previous research, generic federated learning algorithms provided by this framework were manually translated into the CSP processes and algorithms' safety and liveness properties were automatically verified by the model checker PAT. In this paper, a simple translation process is introduced wherein the ChatGPT is used to automate the translation of the mentioned federated learning algorithms in Python into the corresponding CSP processes. Within the process, the minimality of the used context is estimated based on the feedback from ChatGPT. The proposed translation process was experimentally validated by successful translation (verified by the model checker PAT) of both generic centralized and decentralized federated learning algorithms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge bases and strong reasoning capabilities, making them promising tools for complex, multi-agent planning in embodied environments. However, despite LLMs' advanced abilities and the sophisticated modular design of agentic methods, existing LLM-based planning algorithms remain limited by weak adaptation capabilities to multi-agent embodied scenarios. We address this limitation by introducing a framework that enables LLM agents to learn and evolve both before and during test time, equipping them with environment-relevant knowledge for better planning and enhanced communication for improved cooperation. Inspired by centralized training with decentralized execution in multi-agent reinforcement learning, we propose a \textit{Learn as Individuals, Evolve as a Team (LIET)} paradigm for multi-agent LLMs adaptation. At the individual level, LLM agents learn a local utility function from exploratory datasets to better comprehend the embodied environment, which is then queried during test time to support informed decision-making. At the team level, LLM agents collaboratively and iteratively maintain and update a shared cooperation knowledge list based on new experiences, using it to guide more effective communication. By combining individual learning with team evolution, LIET enables comprehensive and flexible adaptation for LLM agents. Our experiments on Communicative Watch-And-Help and ThreeD-World Multi-Agent Transport benchmarks demonstrate that LIET, instantiated with both LLaMA and GPT-4o, outperforms existing baselines and exhibits strong cooperative planning abilities.

Abstract: Smart contract (SC) fuzzing is a critical technique for detecting vulnerabilities in blockchain applications. However, its adoption remains challenging for practitioners due to fundamental differences between SCs and traditional software systems. In this study, we investigate the challenges practitioners face when adopting SC fuzzing tools by conducting an inductive content analysis of 381 GitHub issues from two widely used SC fuzzers: Echidna and Foundry. Furthermore, we conducted a user study to examine how these challenges affect different practitioner groups, SC developers, and traditional software security professionals, and identify strategies practitioners use to overcome them. We systematically categorize these challenges into a taxonomy based on their nature and occurrence within the SC fuzzing workflow. Our findings reveal domain-specific ease-of-use and usefulness challenges, including technical issues with blockchain emulation, and human issues with a lack of accessible documentation and process automation. Our results provide actionable insights for tool developers and researchers, guiding future improvements in SC fuzzer tool design.

Abstract: The smart home systems, based on AI speech recognition and IoT technology, enable people to control devices through verbal commands and make people's lives more efficient. However, existing AI speech recognition services are primarily deployed on cloud platforms on the Internet. When users issue a command, speech recognition devices like ``Amazon Echo'' will post a recording through numerous network nodes, reach multiple servers, and then receive responses through the Internet. This mechanism presents several issues, including unnecessary energy consumption, communication latency, and the risk of a single-point failure. In this position paper, we propose a smart home concept based on offline speech recognition and IoT technology: 1) integrating offline keyword spotting (KWS) technologies into household appliances with limited resource hardware to enable them to understand user voice commands; 2) designing a local IoT network with decentralized architecture to manage and connect various devices, enhancing the robustness and scalability of the system. This proposal of a smart home based on offline speech recognition and IoT technology will allow users to use low-latency voice control anywhere in the home without depending on the Internet and provide better scalability and energy sustainability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL (DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints, communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly expedite the learning process in DMARL.

<title>Exposing Hidden Backdoors in NFT Smart Contracts: A Static Security Analysis of Rug Pull Patterns</title>

Abstract: The explosive growth of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) has revolutionized digital ownership by enabling the creation, exchange, and monetization of unique assets on blockchain networks. However, this surge in popularity has also given rise to a disturbing trend: the emergence of rug pulls - fraudulent schemes where developers exploit trust and smart contract privileges to drain user funds or invalidate asset ownership. Central to many of these scams are hidden backdoors embedded within NFT smart contracts. Unlike unintentional bugs, these backdoors are deliberately coded and often obfuscated to bypass traditional audits and exploit investor confidence. In this paper, we present a large-scale static analysis of 49,940 verified NFT smart contracts using Slither, a static analysis framework, to uncover latent vulnerabilities commonly linked to rug pulls. We introduce a custom risk scoring model that classifies contracts into high, medium, or low risk tiers based on the presence and severity of rug pull indicators. Our dataset was derived from verified contracts on the Ethereum mainnet, and we generate multiple visualizations to highlight red flag clusters, issue prevalence, and co-occurrence of critical vulnerabilities. While we do not perform live exploits, our results reveal how malicious patterns often missed by simple reviews can be surfaced through static analysis at scale. We conclude by offering mitigation strategies for developers, marketplaces, and auditors to enhance smart contract security. By exposing how hidden backdoors manifest in real-world smart contracts, this work contributes a practical foundation for detecting and mitigating NFT rug pulls through scalable automated analysis.

<title>Unraveling Ethereum's Mempool: The Impact of Fee Fairness, Transaction Prioritization, and Consensus Efficiency</title>

Abstract: Ethereum's transaction pool (mempool) dynamics and fee market efficiency critically affect transaction inclusion, validator workload, and overall network performance. This research empirically analyzes gas price variations, mempool clearance rates, and block finalization times in Ethereum's proof-of-stake ecosystem using real-time data from Geth and Prysm nodes. We observe that high-fee transactions are consistently prioritized, while low-fee transactions face delays or exclusion despite EIP-1559's intended improvements. Mempool congestion remains a key factor in validator efficiency and proposal latency. We provide empirical evidence of persistent fee-based disparities and show that extremely high fees do not always guarantee faster confirmation, revealing inefficiencies in the current fee market. To address these issues, we propose congestion-aware fee adjustments, reserved block slots for low-fee transactions, and improved handling of out-of-gas vulnerabilities. By mitigating prioritization bias and execution inefficiencies, our findings support more equitable transaction inclusion, enhance validator performance, and promote scalability. This work contributes to Ethereum's long-term decentralization by reducing dependence on high transaction fees for network participation.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of decentralized optimization on compact submanifolds, where a finite sum of smooth (possibly non-convex) local functions is minimized by $n$ agents forming an undirected and connected graph. However, the efficiency of distributed optimization is often hindered by communication bottlenecks. To mitigate this, we propose the Quantized Riemannian Gradient Tracking (Q-RGT) algorithm, where agents update their local variables using quantized gradients. The introduction of quantization noise allows our algorithm to bypass the constraints of the accurate Riemannian projection operator (such as retraction), further improving iterative efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to achieve an $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ convergence rate in the presence of quantization, matching the convergence rate of methods without quantization. Additionally, we explicitly derive lower bounds on decentralized consensus associated with a function of quantization levels. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Q-RGT performs comparably to non-quantized methods while reducing communication bottlenecks and computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in numerous real-world applications. However, fine-tuning these models at scale, especially in federated settings where data privacy and communication efficiency are critical, presents significant challenges. Existing approaches often resort to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to mitigate communication overhead, but this typically comes at the cost of model accuracy. To this end, we propose federated full-parameter tuning at scale for LLMs (Ferret), the first first-order method with shared randomness to enable scalable full-parameter tuning of LLMs across decentralized data sources while maintaining competitive model accuracy. Ferret accomplishes this through three aspects: (i) it employs widely used first-order methods for efficient local updates; (ii) it projects these updates into a low-dimensional space to considerably reduce communication overhead; and (iii) it reconstructs local updates from this low-dimensional space with shared randomness to facilitate effective full-parameter global aggregation, ensuring fast convergence and competitive final performance. Our rigorous theoretical analyses and insights along with extensive experiments, show that Ferret significantly enhances the scalability of existing federated full-parameter tuning approaches by achieving high computational efficiency, reduced communication overhead, and fast convergence, all while maintaining competitive model accuracy. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/allen4747/Ferret.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges in many machine learning applications, particularly in the setting of distributed training and federated learning, where malicious agents seek to corrupt the training process with the goal of jeopardizing and compromising the performance and reliability of the final models. In this paper, we address the problem of robust federated learning in the presence of such attacks by formulating the training task as a bi-level optimization problem. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the resilience of consensus-based bi-level optimization (CB$^2$O), an interacting multi-particle metaheuristic optimization method, in adversarial settings. Specifically, we provide a global convergence analysis of CB$^2$O in mean-field law in the presence of malicious agents, demonstrating the robustness of CB$^2$O against a diverse range of attacks. Thereby, we offer insights into how specific hyperparameter choices enable to mitigate adversarial effects. On the practical side, we extend CB$^2$O to the clustered federated learning setting by proposing FedCB$^2$O, a novel interacting multi-particle system, and design a practical algorithm that addresses the demands of real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of the FedCB$^2$O algorithm against label-flipping attacks in decentralized clustered federated learning scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness in practical contexts.

Abstract: Federated multi-task learning (FMTL) aims to simultaneously learn multiple related tasks across clients without sharing sensitive raw data. However, in the decentralized setting, existing FMTL frameworks are limited in their ability to capture complex task relationships and handle feature and sample heterogeneity across clients. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel sheaf-theoretic-based approach for FMTL. By representing client relationships using cellular sheaves, our framework can flexibly model interactions between heterogeneous client models. We formulate the sheaf-based FMTL optimization problem using sheaf Laplacian regularization and propose the Sheaf-FMTL algorithm to solve it. We show that the proposed framework provides a unified view encompassing many existing federated learning (FL) and FMTL approaches. Furthermore, we prove that our proposed algorithm, Sheaf-FMTL, achieves a sublinear convergence rate in line with state-of-the-art decentralized FMTL algorithms. Extensive experiments show that although Sheaf-FMTL introduces computational and storage overhead due to the management of interaction maps, it achieves substantial communication savings in terms of transmitted bits when compared to decentralized FMTL baselines. This trade-off makes Sheaf-FMTL especially suitable for cross-silo FL scenarios, where managing model heterogeneity and ensuring communication efficiency are essential, and where clients have adequate computational resources.

Abstract: Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) is a promising paradigm to meet the low-latency and high-bandwidth demands of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, dynamic vehicle mobility and diverse trust boundaries introduce critical security challenges. This paper presents a novel Zero-Trust Mobility-Aware Authentication Framework (ZTMAF) for secure communication in VFC networks. The framework employs context-aware authentication with lightweight cryptographic primitives, a decentralized trust evaluation system, and fog node-assisted session validation to combat spoofing, replay, and impersonation attacks. Simulation results on NS-3 and SUMO demonstrate improved authentication latency, reduced computational overhead, and better scalability compared to traditional PKI and blockchain-based models. Our findings suggest that ZTMAF is effective for secure, real-time V2X interactions under adversarial and mobility-variant scenarios.

<title>Understanding Community-Level Blocklists in Decentralized Social Media</title>

Abstract: Community-level blocklists are key to content moderation practices in decentralized social media. These blocklists enable moderators to prevent other communities, such as those acting in bad faith, from interacting with their own -- and, if shared publicly, warn others about communities worth blocking. Prior work has examined blocklists in centralized social media, noting their potential for collective moderation outcomes, but has focused on blocklists as individual-level tools. To understand how moderators perceive and utilize community-level blocklists and what additional support they may need, we examine social media communities running Mastodon, an open-source microblogging software built on the ActivityPub protocol. We conducted (1) content analysis of the community-level blocklist ecosystem, and (2) semi-structured interviews with twelve Mastodon moderators. Our content analysis revealed wide variation in blocklist goals, inclusion criteria, and transparency. Interviews showed moderators balance proactive safety, reactive practices, and caution around false positives when using blocklists for moderation. They noted challenges and limitations in current blocklist use, suggesting design improvements like comment receipts, category filters, and collaborative voting. We discuss implications for decentralized content moderation, highlighting trade-offs between openness, safety, and nuance; the complexity of moderator roles; and opportunities for future design.

<title>Collaborative Learning in Agentic Systems: A Collective AI is Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts</title>

Abstract: Agentic AI has gained significant interest as a research paradigm focused on autonomy, self-directed learning, and long-term reliability of decision making. Real-world agentic systems operate in decentralized settings on a large set of tasks or data distributions with constraints such as limited bandwidth, asynchronous execution, and the absence of a centralized model or even common objectives. We posit that exploiting previously learned skills, task similarities, and communication capabilities in a collective of agentic AI are challenging but essential elements to enabling scalability, open-endedness, and beneficial collaborative learning dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Modular Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning (MOSAIC), an agentic algorithm that allows multiple agents to independently solve different tasks while also identifying, sharing, and reusing useful machine-learned knowledge, without coordination, synchronization, or centralized control. MOSAIC combines three mechanisms: (1) modular policy composition via neural network masks, (2) cosine similarity estimation using Wasserstein embeddings for knowledge selection, and (3) asynchronous communication and policy integration. Results on a set of RL benchmarks show that MOSAIC has a greater sample efficiency than isolated learners, i.e., it learns significantly faster, and in some cases, finds solutions to tasks that cannot be solved by isolated learners. The collaborative learning and sharing dynamics are also observed to result in the emergence of ideal curricula of tasks, from easy to hard. These findings support the case for collaborative learning in agentic systems to achieve better and continuously evolving performance both at the individual and collective levels.

<title>FedShield-LLM: A Secure and Scalable Federated Fine-Tuned Large Language Model</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework for training and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging computational resources across organizations while keeping sensitive data on local devices. It addresses privacy and security concerns while navigating challenges associated with the substantial computational demands of LLMs, which can be prohibitive for small and medium-sized organizations. FL supports the development of task-specific LLMs for cross-silo applications through fine-tuning but remains vulnerable to inference attacks, such as membership inference and gradient inversion, which threaten data privacy. Prior studies have utilized Differential Privacy (DP) in LLM fine-tuning, which, despite being effective at preserving privacy, can degrade model performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method, FedShield-LLM, that uses pruning with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) parameters, enabling secure computations on encrypted model updates while mitigating the attack surface by deactivating less important LoRA parameters. Furthermore, optimized federated algorithms for cross-silo environments enhance scalability and efficiency. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA substantially reduce computational and communication overhead, making FL feasible for resource-constrained clients. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods while maintaining robust privacy protection, enabling organizations to collaboratively train secure and efficient LLMs.

Abstract: Stablecoins face an unresolved trilemma of balancing decentralization, stability, and regulatory compliance. We present a hybrid stabilization protocol that combines crypto-collateralized reserves, algorithmic futures contracts, and cross-chain liquidity pools to achieve robust price adherence while preserving user privacy. At its core, the protocol introduces stabilization futures contracts (SFCs), non-collateralized derivatives that programmatically incentivize third-party arbitrageurs to counteract price deviations via adaptor signature atomic swaps. Autonomous AI agents optimize delta hedging across decentralized exchanges (DEXs), while zkSNARKs prove compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations without exposing identities or transaction details. Our cryptographic design reduces cross-chain liquidity concentration (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index: 2,400 vs. 4,900 in single-chain systems) and ensures atomicity under standard cryptographic assumptions. The protocol's layered architecture encompassing incentive-compatible SFCs, AI-driven market making, and zero-knowledge regulatory proofs. It provides a blueprint for next-generation decentralized financial infrastructure.

<title>Exploiting Similarity for Computation and Communication-Efficient Decentralized Optimization</title>

Abstract: Reducing communication complexity is critical for efficient decentralized optimization. The proximal decentralized optimization (PDO) framework is particularly appealing, as methods within this framework can exploit functional similarity among nodes to reduce communication rounds. Specifically, when local functions at different nodes are similar, these methods achieve faster convergence with fewer communication steps. However, existing PDO methods often require highly accurate solutions to subproblems associated with the proximal operator, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose the Stabilized Proximal Decentralized Optimization (SPDO) method, which achieves state-of-the-art communication and computational complexities within the PDO framework. Additionally, we refine the analysis of existing PDO methods by relaxing subproblem accuracy requirements and leveraging average functional similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that SPDO significantly outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Trace-based properties are the gold standard for program behaviour analysis. One of the domains of application of this type of analysis is cryptocurrency ledgers, both for the purpose of analyzing the behaviour of the ledger itself, and any user-defined programs called by it, known as smart contracts. The (extended) UTxO ledger model is a kind of ledger model where all smart contract code is stateless, and additional work must be done to model stateful programs. We formalize the application of trace-based analysis to UTxO ledgers and contracts, expressing it in the languages of topology, as well as graph and category theory. To describe valid traces of UTxO ledger executions, and their relation to the behaviour of stateful programs implemented on the ledger, we define a category of simple graphs, infinite paths in which form an ultra-metric space. Maps in this category are arbitrary partial sieve-define homomorphisms of simple graphs. Programs implemented on the ledger correspond to non-expanding maps out of the graph of valid UTxO execution traces. We reason about safety properties in this framework, and prove properties of valid UTxO ledger traces.

<title>Combating Reentrancy Bugs on Sharded Blockchains</title>

Abstract: Reentrancy is a well-known source of smart contract bugs on Ethereum, leading e.g. to double-spending vulnerabilities in DeFi applications. But less is known about this problem in other blockchains, which can have significantly different execution models. Sharded blockchains in particular generally use an asynchronous messaging model that differs substantially from the synchronous and transactional model of Ethereum. We study the features of this model and its effect on reentrancy bugs on three examples: the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain, NEAR Protocol, and MultiversX. We argue that this model, while useful for improving performance, also makes it easier to introduce reentrancy bugs. For example, reviews of the pre-production versions of some of the most critical ICP smart contracts found that 66% (10/15) of the reviewed contracts -- written by expert authors -- contained reentrancy bugs of medium or high severity, with potential damages in tens of millions of dollars. We evaluate existing Ethereum programming techniques (in particular the effects-checks-interactions pattern, and locking) to prevent reentrancy bugs in the context of this new messaging model and identify some issues with them. We then present novel Rust and Motoko patterns that can be leveraged on ICP to solve these issues. Finally, we demonstrate that the formal verification tool TLA+ can be used to find and eliminate such bugs in real world smart contracts on sharded blockchains.

Abstract: Distributed ledger systems, such as blockchains, rely on consensus protocols that commit ordered messages for processing. In practice, message ordering within these systems is often reward-driven. This raises concerns about fairness, particularly in decentralized finance applications, where nodes can exploit transaction orders to maximize rewards referred to as Maximal Extractable Value. This paper provides a systematic understanding of consensus protocols that order messages with different approaches, especially focusing on the ones that promote order fairness, using methods including First-In-First-Out (FIFO), random, and blind ordering. We review the challenges and trade-offs of deriving fair message ordering in a Byzantine fault-tolerant setting, and summarize the requirements for making a fair message ordering consensus protocol. We introduce a design guideline, with which we propose a latency optimization to the state-of-the-art FIFO ordering protocol of Themis. This work provides a systematic way for assessing and enhancing message order fairness in blockchain systems.

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution (OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

Abstract: The InterPlanetary File System~(IPFS) offers a decentralized approach to file storage and sharing, promising resilience and efficiency while also realizing the Web3 paradigm. Simultaneously, the offered anonymity raises significant questions about potential misuse. In this study, we explore methods that malicious actors can exploit IPFS to upload and disseminate harmful content while remaining anonymous. We evaluate the role of pinning services and public gateways, identifying their capabilities and limitations in maintaining content availability. Using scripts, we systematically test the behavior of these services by uploading malicious files. Our analysis reveals that pinning services and public gateways lack mechanisms to assess or restrict the propagation of malicious content.

arXiv:2506.05215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover, we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors) in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

Abstract: We analyze blocks proposed for inclusion in the Ethereum blockchain during 8 minutes on December 3rd, 2024. Our dataset comprises 38 winning blocks, 15,097 proposed blocks, 10,793 unique transactions, and 2,380,014 transaction-block pairings. We find that exclusive transactions--transactions present only in blocks proposed by a single builder--account for 85% of the fees paid by all transactions included in winning blocks. We also find that a surprisingly large number of user transactions are delayed: although proposed during a bidding cycle, they are not included in the corresponding winning block. Many such delayed transactions are exclusive to a losing builder. We also identify two arbitrage bots trading between decentralized (DEX) and centralized exchanges (CEX). By examining their bidding dynamics, we estimate that the implied price at which these bots trade USDC/WETH and USDT/WETH on CEXes is between 3.4 and 4.2 basis points better than the contemporaneous price reported on Binance.

Abstract: We introduce an Implicit Game-Theoretic MPC (IGT-MPC), a decentralized algorithm for two-agent motion planning that uses a learned value function that predicts the game-theoretic interaction outcomes as the terminal cost-to-go function in a model predictive control (MPC) framework, guiding agents to implicitly account for interactions with other agents and maximize their reward. This approach applies to competitive and cooperative multi-agent motion planning problems which we formulate as constrained dynamic games. Given a constrained dynamic game, we randomly sample initial conditions and solve for the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) to generate a dataset of GNE solutions, computing the reward outcome of each game-theoretic interaction from the GNE. The data is used to train a simple neural network to predict the reward outcome, which we use as the terminal cost-to-go function in an MPC scheme. We showcase emerging competitive and coordinated behaviors using IGT-MPC in scenarios such as two-vehicle head-to-head racing and un-signalized intersection navigation. IGT-MPC offers a novel method integrating machine learning and game-theoretic reasoning into model-based decentralized multi-agent motion planning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has come forward as a critical approach for privacy-preserving machine learning in healthcare, allowing collaborative model training across decentralized medical datasets without exchanging clients' data. However, current security implementations for these systems face a fundamental trade-off: rigorous cryptographic protections like fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) impose prohibitive computational overhead, while lightweight alternatives risk vulnerable data leakage through model updates. To address this issue, we present FAS (Fast and Secure Federated Learning), a novel approach that strategically combines selective homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, and bitwise scrambling to achieve robust security without compromising practical usability. Our approach eliminates the need for model pretraining phases while dynamically protecting high-risk model parameters through layered encryption and obfuscation. We implemented FAS using the Flower framework and evaluated it on a cluster of eleven physical machines. Our approach was up to 90\% faster than applying FHE on the model weights. In addition, we eliminated the computational overhead that is required by competitors such as FedML-HE and MaskCrypt. Our approach was up to 1.5$\times$ faster than the competitors while achieving comparable security results.
  Experimental evaluations on medical imaging datasets confirm that FAS maintains similar security results to conventional FHE against gradient inversion attacks while preserving diagnostic model accuracy. These results position FAS as a practical solution for latency-sensitive healthcare applications where both privacy preservation and computational efficiency are requirements.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is increasingly adopted as a decentralized machine learning paradigm due to its capability to preserve data privacy by training models without centralizing user data. However, FL is susceptible to indirect privacy breaches via network traffic analysis-an area not explored in existing research. The primary objective of this research is to study the feasibility of fingerprinting deep learning models deployed within FL environments by analyzing their network-layer traffic information. In this paper, we conduct an experimental evaluation using various deep learning architectures (i.e., CNN, RNN) within a federated learning testbed. We utilize machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient-Boosting, to fingerprint unique patterns within the traffic data. Our experiments show high fingerprinting accuracy, achieving 100% accuracy using Random Forest and around 95.7% accuracy using SVM and Gradient Boosting classifiers. This analysis suggests that we can identify specific architectures running within the subsection of the network traffic. Hence, if an adversary knows about the underlying DL architecture, they can exploit that information and conduct targeted attacks. These findings suggest a notable security vulnerability in FL systems and the necessity of strengthening it at the network level.

Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) across decentralized Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) clients, but such models' massive parameter sizes lead to significant memory and communication challenges. This work introduces Meerkat, a sparse zeroth-order optimization (ZO) method designed for federated LLM fine-tuning. By limiting fine-tuning to a transferable, static, extremely sparse subset of parameters, Meerkat achieves remarkable communication efficiency, enabling cost-effective high-frequency synchronization. With theoretical analysis and experiments, we show that this high-frequency communication effectively mitigates Non-IID data challenges and leads to superior performance compared to full-parameter ZO. Furthermore, experiment results show that Meerkat outperforms existing sparsity baselines with better performance at the same communication frequency. To further handle Non-IID drift, Meerkat leverages traceable local updates and forms a virtual path for each client. This virtual path mechanism reveals the GradIP phenomenon: the inner products between LLM pre-training gradients maintained by server and client gradients estimated via ZO converges for extreme Non-IID clients but oscillates for IID ones. This distinct behavior provides a signal for identifying clients with extreme data heterogeneity. Using this signal, Meerkat-vp is proposed to analyze GradIP trajectories to identify extreme Non-IID clients and applies early stopping to enhance aggregated model quality. Experiments confirm that Meerkat and Meerkat-vp significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ZO federated LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Achieving differentially private computations in decentralized settings poses significant challenges, particularly regarding accuracy, communication cost, and robustness against information leakage. While cryptographic solutions offer promise, they often suffer from high communication overhead or require centralization in the presence of network failures. Conversely, existing fully decentralized approaches typically rely on relaxed adversarial models or pairwise noise cancellation, the latter suffering from substantial accuracy degradation if parties unexpectedly disconnect. In this work, we propose IncA, a new protocol for fully decentralized mean estimation, a widely used primitive in data-intensive processing. Our protocol, which enforces differential privacy, requires no central orchestration and employs low-variance correlated noise, achieved by incrementally injecting sensitive information into the computation. First, we theoretically demonstrate that, when no parties permanently disconnect, our protocol achieves accuracy comparable to that of a centralized setting-already an improvement over most existing decentralized differentially private techniques. Second, we empirically show that our use of low-variance correlated noise significantly mitigates the accuracy loss experienced by existing techniques in the presence of dropouts.

Abstract: In our previous research, we addressed the problem of automated transformation of models, represented using the business process model and notation (BPMN) standard, into the methods of a smart contract. The transformation supports BPMN models that contain complex multi-step activities that are supported using our concept of multi-step nested trade transactions, wherein the transactional properties are enforced by a mechanism generated automatically by the transformation process from a BPMN model to a smart contract. In this paper, we present a methodology for repairing a smart contract that cannot be completed due to events that were not anticipated by the developer and thus prevent the completion of the smart contract. The repair process starts with the original BPMN model fragment causing the issue, providing the modeler with the innermost transaction fragment containing the failed activity. The modeler amends the BPMN pattern on the basis of successful completion of previous activities. If repairs exceed the inner transaction's scope, they are addressed using the parent transaction's BPMN model. The amended BPMN model is then transformed into a new smart contract, ensuring consistent data and logic transitions. We previously developed a tool, called TABS+, as a proof of concept (PoC) to transform BPMN models into smart contracts for nested transactions. This paper describes the tool TABS+R, developed by extending the TABS+ tool, to allow the repair of smart contracts.

Abstract: Smart contracts are computer programs that run on blockchain platforms, with Solidity being the most widely used language for their development. As blockchain technology advances, smart contracts have become increasingly important across various fields. In order for smart contracts to operate correctly, the correctness of the compiler is particularly crucial. Although some research efforts have been devoted to testing Solidity compilers, they primarily focus on testing methods and do not address the core issue of generating test programs. To fill this gap, this paper designs and implements Solsmith, a test program generator specifically aimed at uncovering defects in Solidity compilers. It tests the compiler correctness by generating valid and diverse Solidity programs. We have designed a series of unique program generation strategies tailored to Solidity, including enabling optimizations more frequently, avoiding undefined behaviour, and mitigating behavioural differences caused by intermediate representations. To validate the effectiveness of Solsmith, we assess the effectiveness of the test programs generated by Solsmith using the approach of differential testing. The preliminary results show that Solsmith can generate the expected test programs and uncover four confirmed defects in Solidity compilers, demonstrating the effectiveness and potential of Solsmith.

<title>Depermissioning Web3: a Permissionless Accountable RPC Protocol for Blockchain Networks</title>

Abstract: In blockchain networks, so-called "full nodes" serve data to and relay transactions from clients through an RPC interface. This serving layer enables integration of "Web3" data, stored on blockchains, with "Web2" mobile or web applications that cannot directly participate as peers in a blockchain network. In practice, the serving layer is dominated by a small number of centralized services ("node providers") that offer permissioned access to RPC endpoints. Clients register with these providers because they offer reliable and convenient access to blockchain data: operating a full node themselves requires significant computational and storage resources, and public (permissionless) RPC nodes lack financial incentives to serve large numbers of clients with consistent performance.
  Permissioned access to an otherwise permissionless blockchain network raises concerns regarding the privacy, integrity, and availability of data access. To address this, we propose a Permissionless Accountable RPC Protocol (PARP). It enables clients and full nodes to interact pseudonymously while keeping both parties accountable. PARP leverages "light client" schemes for essential data integrity checks, combined with fraud proofs, to keep full nodes honest and accountable. It integrates payment channels to facilitate micro-payments, holding clients accountable for the resources they consume and providing an economic incentive for full nodes to serve. Our prototype implementation for Ethereum demonstrates the feasibility of PARP, and we quantify its overhead compared to the base RPC protocol.

<title>How To Save Fees in Bitcoin Smart Contracts: a Simple Optimistic Off-chain Protocol</title>

Abstract: We consider the execution of smart contracts on Bitcoin. There, every contract step corresponds to appending to the blockchain a new transaction that spends the output representing the old contract state, creating a new one for the updated state. This standard procedure requires the contract participants to pay transaction fees for every execution step. In this paper, we introduce a protocol that moves most of the execution of a Bitcoin contract off-chain. When all participants follow this protocol, they are able to save on transaction fees, drastically reducing them. By contrast, whenever adversaries try to disrupt the off-chain execution, any honest participant is still able to enforce the correct contract behaviour, by continuing its execution on-chain.

Abstract: Effective group decision-making is critical in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Yet, how different mechanisms for reaching consensus impact collaboration quality and efficiency remains understudied. We conduct a systematic study on group decision-making mechanisms in a decentralized setting. Through controlled experiments, we analyze how different voting rules affect decision quality and efficiency in a multi-round collaboration. Results reveal that majority voting often cause inefficient collaboration due to its strict acceptance criteria. At the extreme, unanimous voting gives 87% lower initial performance than the best-performing method. Our qualitative analysis of cross-agent communication shows that messages become longer and more repetitive over time: while message length increases by 84%, similarity to the previous round increases to 90%. Based on these insights, language-based early stopping methods make the performance 13% closer to oracle while reducing rounds by 50%. Our findings highlight the crucial role of group decision-making in optimizing MAS collaboration.

Abstract: Nakamoto Consensus achieves a decentralized ledger through a single-chain blockchain, assuming a maximum network delay, which limits block generation speed, resulting in low throughput. \cite{pg2018} (PG) enhances throughput using a blockDAG structure, but its probabilistic confirmation restricts smart contract applications. To address this, Mazzaroth proposes a Pow-based blockDAG consensus, employing a linear ordering algorithm to compute the \cite{eth} and achieve state finality, thereby supporting smart contracts. Its dynamic difficulty adjustment, independent of the assumption, adapts to network and hashrate fluctuations, ensuring state consistency via a head chain while maximizing throughput. Simulations validate Mazzaroth's efficient consensus performance. This paper presents the Mazzaroth ordering algorithm, the difficulty adjustment mechanism, and performance evaluation.

Abstract: The edge-cloud continuum has emerged as a transformative paradigm that meets the growing demand for low-latency, scalable, end-to-end service delivery by integrating decentralized edge resources with centralized cloud infrastructures. Driven by the exponential growth of IoT-generated data and the need for real-time responsiveness, this continuum features multi-layered architectures. However, its adoption is hindered by infrastructural challenges, fragmented standards, and limited guidance for developers and researchers. Existing surveys rarely tackle practical implementation or recent industrial advances. This survey closes those gaps from a developer-oriented perspective, introducing a conceptual framework for navigating the edge-cloud continuum. We systematically examine architectural models, performance metrics, and paradigms for computation, communication, and deployment, together with enabling technologies and widely used edge-to-cloud platforms. We also discuss real-world applications in smart cities, healthcare, and Industry 4.0, as well as tools for testing and experimentation. Drawing on academic research and practices of leading cloud providers, this survey serves as a practical guide for developers and a structured reference for researchers, while identifying open challenges and emerging trends that will shape the future of the continuum.

<title>Blockchain Powered Edge Intelligence for U-Healthcare in Privacy Critical and Time Sensitive Environment</title>

Abstract: Edge Intelligence (EI) serves as a critical enabler for privacy-preserving systems by providing AI-empowered computation and distributed caching services at the edge, thereby minimizing latency and enhancing data privacy. The integration of blockchain technology further augments EI frameworks by ensuring transactional transparency, auditability, and system-wide reliability through a decentralized network model. However, the operational architecture of such systems introduces inherent vulnerabilities, particularly due to the extensive data interactions between edge gateways (EGs) and the distributed nature of information storage during service provisioning. To address these challenges, we propose an autonomous computing model along with its interaction topologies tailored for privacy-critical and time-sensitive health applications. The system supports continuous monitoring, real-time alert notifications, disease detection, and robust data processing and aggregation. It also includes a data transaction handler and mechanisms for ensuring privacy at the EGs. Moreover, a resource-efficient one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) is proposed for the multiclass classification of arrhythmia, enabling accurate and real-time analysis of constrained EGs. Furthermore, a secure access scheme is defined to manage both off-chain and on-chain data sharing and storage. To validate the proposed model, comprehensive security, performance, and cost analyses are conducted, demonstrating the efficiency and reliability of the fine-grained access control scheme.

<title>EvoGit: Decentralized Code Evolution via Git-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>

Abstract: We introduce EvoGit, a decentralized multi-agent framework for collaborative software development driven by autonomous code evolution. EvoGit deploys a population of independent coding agents, each proposing edits to a shared codebase without centralized coordination, explicit message passing, or shared memory. Instead, all coordination emerges through a Git-based phylogenetic graph that tracks the full version lineage and enables agents to asynchronously read from and write to the evolving code repository. This graph-based structure supports fine-grained branching, implicit concurrency, and scalable agent interaction while preserving a consistent historical record. Human involvement is minimal but strategic: users define high-level goals, periodically review the graph, and provide lightweight feedback to promote promising directions or prune unproductive ones. Experiments demonstrate EvoGit's ability to autonomously produce functional and modular software artifacts across two real-world tasks: (1) building a web application from scratch using modern frameworks, and (2) constructing a meta-level system that evolves its own language-model-guided solver for the bin-packing optimization problem. Our results underscore EvoGit's potential to establish a new paradigm for decentralized, automated, and continual software development. EvoGit is open-sourced at https://github.com/BillHuang2001/evogit.

Abstract: Blockchain benefits are due to immutability, replication, and storage-and-execution of smart contracts on the blockchain. However, the benefits come at increased costs due to the blockchain size and execution. We address three fundamental issues that arise in transferring certain parts of a smart contract to be executed off-chain: (i) identifying which parts (patterns) of the smart contract should be considered for processing off-chain, (ii) under which conditions should a smart-contract pattern to be processed off-chain, and (iii) how to facilitate interaction between the computation off and on-chain. We use separation of concerns and FSM modeling to model a smart contract and generate its code. We then (i) use our algorithm to determine which parts (patterns) of the smart contract are to be processed off-chain; (ii) consider conditions under which to move the pattern off-chain; and (iii) provide model for automatically generating the interface between on and off-chain computation.

Abstract: web3 wallets are key to managing user identity on blockchain. The main purpose of a web3 wallet application is to manage the private key for the user and provide an interface to interact with the blockchain. The key management scheme ( KMS ) used by the wallet to store and recover the private key can be either custodial, where the keys are permissioned and in custody of the wallet provider or noncustodial where the keys are in custody of the user. The existing non-custodial key management schemes tend to offset the burden of storing and recovering the key entirely on the user by asking them to remember seed-phrases. This creates onboarding hassles for the user and introduces the risk that the user may lose their assets if they forget or lose their seedphrase/private key. In this paper, we propose a novel method of backing up user keys using a non-custodial key management technique that allows users to save and recover a backup of their private key using any independent sign-in method such as google-oAuth or other 3P oAuth.

Abstract: Blockchain technology relies on decentralization to resist faults and attacks while operating without trusted intermediaries. Although industry experts have touted decentralization as central to their promise and disruptive potential, it is still unclear whether the crypto ecosystems built around blockchains are becoming more or less decentralized over time. As crypto plays an increasing role in facilitating economic transactions and peer-to-peer interactions, measuring their decentralization becomes even more essential. We thus propose a systematic framework for measuring the decentralization of crypto ecosystems over time and compare commonly used decentralization metrics. We applied this framework to seven prominent crypto ecosystems, across five distinct subsystems and across their lifetime for over 15 years. Our analysis revealed that while crypto has largely become more decentralized over time, recent trends show a shift toward centralization in the consensus layer, NFT marketplaces, and developers. Our framework and results inform researchers, policymakers, and practitioners about the design, regulation, and implementation of crypto ecosystems and provide a systematic, replicable foundation for future studies.

<title>A Novel Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Computation Offloading in Multi-User Mobile Edge Computing with Decentralization</title>

Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) allows appliances to offload workloads to neighboring MEC servers that have the potential for computation-intensive tasks with limited computational capabilities. This paper studied how deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms are used in an MEC system to find feasible decentralized dynamic computation offloading strategies, which leads to the construction of an extensible MEC system that operates effectively with finite feedback. Even though the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, subject to their knowledge of the MEC system, can be used to allocate powers of both computation offloading and local execution, to learn a computation offloading policy for each user independently, we realized that this solution still has some inherent weaknesses. Hence, we introduced a new approach for this problem based on the Twin Delayed DDPG algorithm, which enables us to overcome this proneness and investigate cases where mobile users are portable. Numerical results showed that individual users can autonomously learn adequate policies through the proposed approach. Besides, the performance of the suggested solution exceeded the conventional DDPG-based power control strategy.

Abstract: Metaverse and Digital Twin (DT) have attracted much academic and industrial attraction to approach the future digital world. This paper introduces the advantages of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in assisting Metaverse system-based Digital Twin. In this system, we assume that it includes several Metaverse User devices collecting data from the real world to transfer it into the virtual world, a Metaverse Virtual Access Point (MVAP) undertaking the processing of data, and an edge computing server that receives the offloading data from the MVAP. The proposed model works under a dynamic environment with various parameters changing over time. The experiment results show that our proposed DRL algorithm is suitable for offloading tasks to ensure the promptness of DT in a dynamic environment.

Abstract: Edge computing addresses the growing data demands of connected-device networks by placing computational resources closer to end users through decentralized infrastructures. This decentralization challenges traditional, fully centralized orchestration, which suffers from latency and resource bottlenecks. We present \textbf{FAuNO} -- \emph{Federated Asynchronous Network Orchestrator} -- a buffered, asynchronous \emph{federated reinforcement-learning} (FRL) framework for decentralized task offloading in edge systems. FAuNO adopts an actor-critic architecture in which local actors learn node-specific dynamics and peer interactions, while a federated critic aggregates experience across agents to encourage efficient cooperation and improve overall system performance. Experiments in the \emph{PeersimGym} environment show that FAuNO consistently matches or exceeds heuristic and federated multi-agent RL baselines in reducing task loss and latency, underscoring its adaptability to dynamic edge-computing scenarios.

Abstract: With the development of the Internet, the amount of data generated by the medical industry each year has grown exponentially. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) manages the electronic data generated during the user's treatment process. Typically, an EHR data manager belongs to a medical institution. This traditional centralized data management model has many unreasonable or inconvenient aspects, such as difficulties in data sharing, and it is hard to verify the authenticity and integrity of the data. The decentralized, non-forgeable, data unalterable and traceable features of blockchain are in line with the application requirements of EHR. This paper takes the most common COVID-19 as the application scenario and designs a COVID-19 health system based on blockchain, which has extensive research and application value. Considering that the public and transparent nature of blockchain violates the privacy requirements of some health data, in the system design stage, from the perspective of practical application, the data is divided into public data and private data according to its characteristics. For private data, data encryption methods are adopted to ensure data privacy. The searchable encryption technology is combined with blockchain technology to achieve the retrieval function of encrypted data. Then, the proxy re-encryption technology is used to realize authorized access to data. In the system implementation part, based on the Hyperledger Fabric architecture, some functions of the system design are realized, including data upload, retrieval of the latest data and historical data. According to the environment provided by the development architecture, Go language chaincode (smart contract) is written to implement the relevant system functions.

Abstract: A significant body of research in decentralized federated learning focuses on combining the privacy-preserving properties of federated learning with the resilience and transparency offered by blockchain-based systems. While these approaches are promising, they often lack flexible tools to evaluate system robustness under adversarial conditions. To fill this gap, we present FedBlockParadox, a modular framework for modeling and evaluating decentralized federated learning systems built on blockchain technologies, with a focus on resilience against a broad spectrum of adversarial attack scenarios. It supports multiple consensus protocols, validation methods, aggregation strategies, and configurable attack models. By enabling controlled experiments, FedBlockParadox provides a valuable resource for researchers developing secure, decentralized learning solutions. The framework is open-source and built to be extensible by the community.

Abstract: Development of blockchain smart contracts is more difficult than mainstream software development because the underlying blockchain infrastructure poses additional complexity. To ease the developer's task of writing smart contract, as other research efforts, we also use Business Process Model and Notation BPMN modeling to describe application requirements for trade of goods and services and then transform automatically the BPMN model into the methods of a smart contract. In our previous research we described our approach and a tool to Transform Automatically BPMN models into Smart contracts TABS. In this paper, we describe how the TABS approach is augmented with the support for a BPMN collaborative transaction by several actors. Our approach analyzes the BPMN model to determine which patterns in the BPMN model are suitable for use as collaborative transactions. The found BPMN patterns that are suitable as transactions are shown to the developer who decides which ones should be deployed as collaborative transactions. We describe how our approach automatically transform the BPMN model into smart contract the provides a transaction mechanism to enforce the transactional properties of the nested transactions. Our approach greatly reduces the developers task as synchronization of collaborative activities is provided by our approach, so that the developer needs to code only independent tasks with well-defined inputs and outputs. We also overview the TABS+ tool we built as a proof of concept to show that our approach is feasible. Finally, we provide estimates on the cost of supporting the nested BPMN collaborative transactions.

Abstract: Major domains such as logistics, healthcare, and smart cities increasingly rely on sensor technologies and distributed infrastructures to monitor complex processes in real time. These developments are transforming the data landscape from discrete, structured records stored in centralized systems to continuous, fine-grained, and heterogeneous event streams collected across distributed environments. As a result, traditional process mining techniques, which assume centralized event logs from enterprise systems, are no longer sufficient. In this paper, we discuss the conceptual and methodological foundations for this emerging field. We identify three key shifts: from offline to online analysis, from centralized to distributed computing, and from event logs to sensor data. These shifts challenge traditional assumptions about process data and call for new approaches that integrate infrastructure, data, and user perspectives. To this end, we define a research agenda that addresses six interconnected fields, each spanning multiple system dimensions. We advocate a principled methodology grounded in algorithm engineering, combining formal modeling with empirical evaluation. This approach enables the development of scalable, privacy-aware, and user-centric process mining techniques suitable for distributed environments. Our synthesis provides a roadmap for advancing process mining beyond its classical setting, toward a more responsive and decentralized paradigm of process intelligence.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods have achieved state-of-the-art results on a range of multi-agent tasks. Yet, MARL algorithms typically require significantly more environment interactions than their single-agent counterparts to converge, a problem exacerbated by the difficulty in exploring over a large joint action space and the high variance intrinsic to MARL environments. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel algorithm that combines a decomposed centralized critic with decentralized ensemble learning, incorporating several key contributions. The main component in our scheme is a selective exploration method that leverages ensemble kurtosis. We extend the global decomposed critic with a diversity-regularized ensemble of individual critics and utilize its excess kurtosis to guide exploration toward high-uncertainty states and actions. To improve sample efficiency, we train the centralized critic with a novel truncated variation of the TD($\lambda$) algorithm, enabling efficient off-policy learning with reduced variance. On the actor side, our suggested algorithm adapts the mixed samples approach to MARL, mixing on-policy and off-policy loss functions for training the actors. This approach balances between stability and efficiency and outperforms purely off-policy learning. The evaluation shows our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on standard MARL benchmarks, including a variety of SMAC II maps.

Abstract: In this paper, we design and implement a web crawler system based on the Solana blockchain for the automated collection and analysis of market data for popular non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the chain. Firstly, the basic information and transaction data of popular NFTs on the Solana chain are collected using the Selenium tool. Secondly, the transaction records of the Magic Eden trading market are thoroughly analyzed by combining them with the Scrapy framework to examine the price fluctuations and market trends of NFTs. In terms of data analysis, this paper employs time series analysis to examine the dynamics of the NFT market and seeks to identify potential price patterns. In addition, the risk and return of different NFTs are evaluated using the mean-variance optimization model, taking into account their characteristics, such as illiquidity and market volatility, to provide investors with data-driven portfolio recommendations. The experimental results show that the combination of crawler technology and financial analytics can effectively analyze NFT data on the Solana blockchain and provide timely market insights and investment strategies. This study provides a reference for further exploration in the field of digital currencies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art results across diverse domains, yet their development remains reliant on vast amounts of publicly available data, raising concerns about data scarcity and the lack of access to domain-specific, sensitive information. Federated Learning (FL) presents a compelling framework to address these challenges by enabling decentralized fine-tuning on pre-trained LLMs without sharing raw data. However, the compatibility and performance of pre-trained LLMs in FL settings remain largely under explored. We introduce the FlowerTune LLM Leaderboard, a first-of-its-kind benchmarking suite designed to evaluate federated fine-tuning of LLMs across four diverse domains: general NLP, finance, medical, and coding. Each domain includes federated instruction-tuning datasets and domain-specific evaluation metrics. Our results, obtained through a collaborative, open-source and community-driven approach, provide the first comprehensive comparison across 26 pre-trained LLMs with different aggregation and fine-tuning strategies under federated settings, offering actionable insights into model performance, resource constraints, and domain adaptation. This work lays the foundation for developing privacy-preserving, domain-specialized LLMs for real-world applications.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has been gaining popularity due to its successful adaptation to large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce Privacy-preserving Collaborative Mixture-of-Experts (PC-MoE), which leverages the sparsity of the MoE architecture for memory-efficient decentralized collaborative LLM training, enabling multiple parties with limited GPU-memory and data resources to collectively train more capable LLMs than they could achieve individually. At the same time, this approach protects training data privacy of each participant by keeping training data, as well as parts of the forward pass signal and gradients locally within each party. By design, PC-MoE synergistically combines the strengths of distributed computation with strong confidentiality assurances. Unlike most privacy-preserving schemes, which pay for confidentiality with lower task accuracy, our framework breaks that trade-off: across seven popular LLM benchmarks, it almost matches (and sometimes exceeds) the performance and convergence rate of a fully centralized model, enjoys near 70% peak GPU RAM reduction, while being fully robust against reconstruction attacks.

<title>Dynamic Fee for Reducing Impermanent Loss in Decentralized Exchanges</title>

Abstract: Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are crucial to decentralized finance (DeFi) as they enable trading without intermediaries. However, they face challenges like impermanent loss (IL), where liquidity providers (LPs) see their assets' value change unfavorably within a liquidity pool compared to outside it. To tackle these issues, we propose dynamic fee mechanisms over traditional fixed-fee structures used in automated market makers (AMM). Our solution includes asymmetric fees via block-adaptive, deal-adaptive, and the "ideal but unattainable" oracle-based fee algorithm, utilizing all data available to arbitrageurs to mitigate IL. We developed a simulation-based framework to compare these fee algorithms systematically. This framework replicates trading on a DEX, considering both informed and uninformed users and a psychological relative loss factor. Results show that adaptive algorithms outperform fixed-fee baselines in reducing IL while maintaining trading activity among uninformed users. Additionally, insights from oracle-based performance underscore the potential of dynamic fee strategies to lower IL, boost LP profitability, and enhance overall market efficiency.

<title>A Preference-Driven Methodology for High-Quality Solidity Code Generation</title>

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in generating functionally correct Solidity code, they continue to face critical challenges in producing gas-efficient and secure code, which are critical requirements for real-world smart contract deployment. Although recent advances leverage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for code preference alignment, existing approaches treat functional correctness, gas optimization, and security as independent objectives, resulting in contracts that may achieve operational soundness but suffer from prohibitive execution costs or dangerous vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we propose PrefGen, a novel framework that extends standard DPO beyond human preferences to incorporate quantifiable blockchain-specific metrics, enabling holistic multi-objective optimization specifically tailored for smart contract generation. Our framework introduces a comprehensive evaluation methodology with four complementary metrics: Pass@k (functional correctness), Compile@k (syntactic correctness), Gas@k (gas efficiency), and Secure@k (security assessment), providing rigorous multi-dimensional contract evaluation. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that PrefGen significantly outperforms existing approaches across all critical dimensions, achieving 66.7% Pass@5, 58.9% Gas@5, and 62.5% Secure@5, while generating production-ready smart contracts that are functionally correct, cost-efficient, and secure.

<title>Backpressure-based Mean-field Type Game for Scheduling in Multi-Hop Wireless Sensor Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Mean-Field Type Game (MFTG) framework for effective scheduling in multi-hop wireless sensor networks (WSNs) using backpressure as a performance criterion. Traditional backpressure algorithms leverage queue differentials to regulate data flow and maintain network stability. In this work, we extend the backpressure framework by incorporating a mean-field term into the cost functional, capturing the global behavior of the system alongside local dynamics. The resulting model utilizes the strengths of non-cooperative mean-field type games, enabling nodes to make decentralized decisions based on both individual queue states and system mean-field effects while accounting for stochastic network interactions. By leveraging the interplay between backpressure dynamics and mean-field coupling, the approach balances local optimization with global efficiency. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling congestion and scheduling in large-scale WSNs.

<title>Enhancing Interpretability of Quantum-Assisted Blockchain Clustering via AI Agent-Based Qualitative Analysis</title>

Abstract: Blockchain transaction data is inherently high dimensional, noisy, and entangled, posing substantial challenges for traditional clustering algorithms. While quantum enhanced clustering models have demonstrated promising performance gains, their interpretability remains limited, restricting their application in sensitive domains such as financial fraud detection and blockchain governance. To address this gap, we propose a two stage analysis framework that synergistically combines quantitative clustering evaluation with AI Agent assisted qualitative interpretation. In the first stage, we employ classical clustering methods and evaluation metrics including the Silhouette Score, Davies Bouldin Index, and Calinski Harabasz Index to determine the optimal cluster count and baseline partition quality. In the second stage, we integrate an AI Agent to generate human readable, semantic explanations of clustering results, identifying intra cluster characteristics and inter cluster relationships. Our experiments reveal that while fully trained Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) outperform random Quantum Features (QF) in quantitative metrics, the AI Agent further uncovers nuanced differences between these methods, notably exposing the singleton cluster phenomenon in QNN driven models. The consolidated insights from both stages consistently endorse the three cluster configuration, demonstrating the practical value of our hybrid approach. This work advances the interpretability frontier in quantum assisted blockchain analytics and lays the groundwork for future autonomous AI orchestrated clustering frameworks.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) achieve scalability by dynamically activating subsets of their components. Yet, understanding how expertise emerges through joint training of gating mechanisms and experts remains incomplete, especially in scenarios without clear task partitions. Motivated by inference costs and data heterogeneity, we study how joint training of gating functions and experts can dynamically allocate domain-specific expertise across multiple underlying data distributions. As an outcome of our framework, we develop an instance tailored specifically to decentralized training scenarios, introducing \textit{Dynamically Decentralized Orchestration of MoEs} or \texttt{DDOME}. \texttt{DDOME} leverages heterogeneity emerging from distributional shifts across decentralized data sources to specialize experts dynamically. By integrating a pretrained common expert to inform a gating function, \texttt{DDOME} achieves personalized expert subset selection on-the-fly, facilitating just-in-time personalization. We empirically validate \texttt{DDOME} within a Federated Learning (FL) context: \texttt{DDOME} attains from 4\% up to an 24\% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art FL baselines in image and text classification tasks, while maintaining competitive zero-shot generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights confirming that the joint gating-experts training is critical for achieving meaningful expert specialization.

Abstract: Decentraland is a blockchain-based social virtual world where users can publish and sell wearables to customize avatars. In it, the third-party Decentral Games (DG) allows players of its flagship game ICE Poker to earn cryptocurrency only if they possess certain wearables. Herein, we present a comprehensive study on how DG and its game influence the dynamics of wearables and in-world visits in Decentraland. To this end, we analyzed 5.9 million wearable transfers made on the Polygon blockchain (and related sales) over a two-year period, and 677 million log events of in-world user positions in an overlapping 10-month period. We found that these activities are disproportionately related to DG, with its ICE Poker casinos (less than 0.1% of the world map) representing a remarkable average share of daily unique visitors (33%) and time spent in the virtual world (20%). Despite several alternative initiatives within Decentraland, ICE Poker appears to drive user activity on the platform. Our work thus contributes to the understanding of how play-to-earn games influence user behavior in social virtual worlds, and it is among the first to study the emerging phenomenon of virtual blockchain-based gambling.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are widely utilized for mapping and exploration tasks due to their cost-effectiveness. Multi-robot systems offer scalability and efficiency, especially in terms of the number of robots deployed in more complex environments. These tasks belong to the set of Multi-Robot Informative Path Planning (MRIPP) problems. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach for the MRIPP problem. We aim to maximize the number of discovered stationary targets in an unknown 3D environment while operating under resource constraints (such as path length). Here, each robot aims to maximize discovered targets, avoid unknown static obstacles, and prevent inter-robot collisions while operating under communication and resource constraints. We utilize the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm to train a single policy neural network. A key aspect of our approach is our coordination graph that prioritizes visiting regions not yet explored by other robots. Our learned policy can be copied onto any number of robots for deployment in more complex environments not seen during training. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by at least 26.2% in terms of the number of discovered targets while requiring a planning time of less than 2 sec per step. We present results for more complex environments with up to 64 robots and compare success rates against baseline planners.

<title>Understanding Federated Learning from IID to Non-IID dataset: An Experimental Study</title>

Abstract: As privacy concerns and data regulations grow, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for training machine learning models across decentralized data sources without sharing raw data. However, a significant challenge in FL is that client data are often non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed), leading to reduced performance compared to centralized learning. While many methods have been proposed to address this issue, their underlying mechanisms are often viewed from different perspectives. Through a comprehensive investigation from gradient descent to FL, and from IID to non-IID data settings, we find that inconsistencies in client loss landscapes primarily cause performance degradation in non-IID scenarios. From this understanding, we observe that existing methods can be grouped into two main strategies: (i) adjusting parameter update paths and (ii) modifying client loss landscapes. These findings offer a clear perspective on addressing non-IID challenges in FL and help guide future research in the field.

<title>Shill Bidding Prevention in Decentralized Auctions Using Smart Contracts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In online auctions, fraudulent behaviors such as shill bidding pose significant risks. This paper presents a conceptual framework that applies dynamic, behavior-based penalties to deter auction fraud using blockchain smart contracts. Unlike traditional post-auction detection methods, this approach prevents manipulation in real-time by introducing an economic disincentive system where penalty severity scales with suspicious bidding patterns. The framework employs the proposed Bid Shill Score (BSS) to evaluate nine distinct bidding behaviors, dynamically adjusting the penalty fees to make fraudulent activity financially unaffordable while providing fair competition.
  The system is implemented within a decentralized English auction on the Ethereum blockchain, demonstrating how smart contracts enforce transparent auction rules without trusted intermediaries. Simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model: the dynamic penalty mechanism reduces the profitability of shill bidding while keeping penalties low for honest bidders. Performance evaluation shows that the system introduces only moderate gas and latency overhead, keeping transaction costs and response times within practical bounds for real-world use. The approach provides a practical method for behaviour-based fraud prevention in decentralised systems where trust cannot be assumed.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised a new challenge for developers since it is prone to known and unknown cyberattacks due to its heterogeneity, flexibility, and close connectivity. To defend against such security breaches, researchers have focused on building sophisticated intrusion detection systems (IDSs) using machine learning (ML) techniques. Although these algorithms notably improve detection performance, they require excessive computing power and resources, which are crucial issues in IoT networks considering the recent trends of decentralized data processing and computing systems. Consequently, many optimization techniques have been incorporated with these ML models. Specifically, a special category of optimizer adopted from the behavior of living creatures and different aspects of natural phenomena, known as metaheuristic algorithms, has been a central focus in recent years and brought about remarkable results. Considering this vital significance, we present a comprehensive and systematic review of various applications of metaheuristics algorithms in developing a machine learning-based IDS, especially for IoT. A significant contribution of this study is the discovery of hidden correlations between these optimization techniques and machine learning models integrated with state-of-the-art IoT-IDSs. In addition, the effectiveness of these metaheuristic algorithms in different applications, such as feature selection, parameter or hyperparameter tuning, and hybrid usages are separately analyzed. Moreover, a taxonomy of existing IoT-IDSs is proposed. Furthermore, we investigate several critical issues related to such integration. Our extensive exploration ends with a discussion of promising optimization algorithms and technologies that can enhance the efficiency of IoT-IDSs.

Abstract: Consensus is a popular technique for distributed state estimation. This formulation allows networks of connected agents or sensors to exchange information about the distribution of a set of targets with their immediate neighbors without the need of a centralized node or layer. We present decentralized consensus-based fusion techniques for a system whose target prior estimates are a weighted mixture of Gaussian probability density functions (PDFs) for the following cases: 1) in which all agents have the same a priori Gaussian mixture estimate of the target, and 2) in which agents have different a priori Gaussian mixture estimates of the target. For the second case, we present a formulation that fuses each agent's a priori estimate without using local observations such that each agent's posterior estimate is the same across the network.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has attracted increasing attention to mitigate security and privacy challenges in traditional cloud-centric machine learning models specifically in healthcare ecosystems. FL methodologies enable the training of global models through localized policies, allowing independent operations at the edge clients' level. Conventional first-order FL approaches face several challenges in personalized model training due to heterogeneous non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data of each edge client. Recently, second-order FL approaches maintain the stability and consistency of non-iid datasets while improving personalized model training. This study proposes and develops a verifiable and auditable optimized second-order FL framework BFEL (blockchain-enhanced federated edge learning) based on optimized FedCurv for personalized healthcare systems. FedCurv incorporates information about the importance of each parameter to each client's task (through Fisher Information Matrix) which helps to preserve client-specific knowledge and reduce model drift during aggregation. Moreover, it minimizes communication rounds required to achieve a target precision convergence for each edge client while effectively managing personalized training on non-iid and heterogeneous data. The incorporation of Ethereum-based model aggregation ensures trust, verifiability, and auditability while public key encryption enhances privacy and security. Experimental results of federated CNNs and MLPs utilizing Mnist, Cifar-10, and PathMnist demonstrate the high efficiency and scalability of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning (ML) model training while preserving data privacy by keeping data localized across clients. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients poses a significant challenge, leading to skewed model updates and performance degradation. Addressing this, we propose PSI-PFL, a novel client selection framework for Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) that leverages the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify and mitigate data heterogeneity (so-called non-IIDness). Our approach selects more homogeneous clients based on PSI, reducing the impact of label skew, one of the most detrimental factors in FL performance. Experimental results over multiple data modalities (tabular, image, text) demonstrate that PSI-PFL significantly improves global model accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10\% under non-IID scenarios while ensuring fairer local performance. PSI-PFL enhances FL performance and offers practical benefits in applications where data privacy and heterogeneity are critical.

<title>Federated learning framework for collaborative remaining useful life prognostics: an aircraft engine case study</title>

Abstract: Complex systems such as aircraft engines are continuously monitored by sensors. In predictive aircraft maintenance, the collected sensor measurements are used to estimate the health condition and the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of such systems. However, a major challenge when developing prognostics is the limited number of run-to-failure data samples. This challenge could be overcome if multiple airlines would share their run-to-failure data samples such that sufficient learning can be achieved. Due to privacy concerns, however, airlines are reluctant to share their data in a centralized setting. In this paper, a collaborative federated learning framework is therefore developed instead. Here, several airlines cooperate to train a collective RUL prognostic machine learning model, without the need to centrally share their data. For this, a decentralized validation procedure is proposed to validate the prognostics model without sharing any data. Moreover, sensor data is often noisy and of low quality. This paper therefore proposes four novel methods to aggregate the parameters of the global prognostic model. These methods enhance the robustness of the FL framework against noisy data. The proposed framework is illustrated for training a collaborative RUL prognostic model for aircraft engines, using the N-CMAPSS dataset. Here, six airlines are considered, that collaborate in the FL framework to train a collective RUL prognostic model for their aircraft's engines. When comparing the proposed FL framework with the case where each airline independently develops their own prognostic model, the results show that FL leads to more accurate RUL prognostics for five out of the six airlines. Moreover, the novel robust aggregation methods render the FL framework robust to noisy data samples.

Abstract: Ethereum's scalability limitations pose significant challenges for the adoption of decentralized applications (dApps). Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK Rollups) present a promising solution, bundling transactions off-chain and submitting validity proofs on-chain to enhance throughput and efficiency. In this work, we examine the technical underpinnings of ZK Rollups and stress test their performance in real-world applications in decentralized finance (DeFi). We set up a proof-of-concept (PoC) consisting of ZK rollup and decentralized exchange, and implement load balancer generating token swaps. Our results show that the rollup can process up to 71 swap transactions per second, compared to 12 general transaction by Ethereum. We further analyze transaction finality trade-offs with related security concerns, and discuss the future directions for integrating ZK Rollups into Ethereum's broader ecosystem.

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending enables permissionless borrowing via smart contracts. However, it faces challenges in optimizing interest rates, mitigating bad debt, and improving capital efficiency. Rule-based interest-rate models struggle to adapt to dynamic market conditions, leading to inefficiencies. This work applies Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize interest rate adjustments in DeFi lending protocols. Using historical data from Aave protocol, we evaluate three RL approaches: Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), Behavior Cloning (BC), and TD3 with Behavior Cloning (TD3-BC). TD3-BC demonstrates superior performance in balancing utilization, capital stability, and risk, outperforming existing models. It adapts effectively to historical stress events like the May 2021 crash and the March 2023 USDC depeg, showcasing potential for automated, real-time governance.

Abstract: This study addresses critical challenges in managing the transportation of spent nuclear fuel, including inadequate data transparency, stringent confidentiality requirements, and a lack of trust among collaborating parties, issues prevalent in traditional centralized management systems. Given the high risks involved, balancing data confidentiality with regulatory transparency is imperative. To overcome these limitations, a prototype system integrating blockchain technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed, featuring a multi-tiered consortium chain architecture. This system utilizes IoT sensors for real-time data collection, which is immutably recorded on the blockchain, while a hierarchical data structure (operational, supervisory, and public layers) manages access for diverse stakeholders. The results demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances data immutability, enables real-time multi-sensor data integration, improves decentralized transparency, and increases resilience compared to traditional systems. Ultimately, this blockchain-IoT framework improves the safety, transparency, and efficiency of spent fuel transportation, effectively resolving the conflict between confidentiality and transparency in nuclear data management and offering significant practical implications.

Abstract: Weighted bandwidth allocation is a powerful abstraction that has a wide range of use cases in modern data center networks. However, realizing highly agile and precise weighted bandwidth allocation for large-scale cloud environments is fundamentally challenging. In this paper, we propose S\"{o}ze, a lightweight decentralized weighted bandwidth allocation system that leverages simple network telemetry features of commodity Ethernet switches. Given the flow weights, S\"{o}ze can effectively use the telemetry information to compute and enforce the weighted bandwidth allocations without per-flow, topology, or routing knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of S\"{o}ze through simulations and testbed experiments, improving TPC-H jobs completion time by up to $0.59\times$ and $0.79\times$ on average.

<title>Addressing the Collaboration Dilemma in Low-Data Federated Learning via Transient Sparsity</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy, leveraging aggregated updates to build robust global models. However, this training paradigm faces significant challenges due to data heterogeneity and limited local datasets, which often impede effective collaboration. In such scenarios, we identify the Layer-wise Inertia Phenomenon in FL, wherein the middle layers of global model undergo minimal updates after early communication rounds, ultimately limiting the effectiveness of global aggregation. We demonstrate the presence of this phenomenon across a wide range of federated settings, spanning diverse datasets and architectures. To address this issue, we propose LIPS (Layer-wise Inertia Phenomenon with Sparsity), a simple yet effective method that periodically introduces transient sparsity to stimulate meaningful updates and empower global aggregation. Experiments demonstrate that LIPS effectively mitigates layer-wise inertia, enhances aggregation effectiveness, and improves overall performance in various FL scenarios. This work not only deepens the understanding of layer-wise learning dynamics in FL but also paves the way for more effective collaboration strategies in resource-constrained environments. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/QiaoXiao7282/LIPS.

<title>Legal Compliance Evaluation of Smart Contracts Generated By Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Smart contracts can implement and automate parts of legal contracts, but ensuring their legal compliance remains challenging. Existing approaches such as formal specification, verification, and model-based development require expertise in both legal and software development domains, as well as extensive manual effort. Given the recent advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation, we investigate their ability to generate legally compliant smart contracts directly from natural language legal contracts, addressing these challenges. We propose a novel suite of metrics to quantify legal compliance based on modeling both legal and smart contracts as processes and comparing their behaviors. We select four LLMs, generate 20 smart contracts based on five legal contracts, and analyze their legal compliance. We find that while all LLMs generate syntactically correct code, there is significant variance in their legal compliance with larger models generally showing higher levels of compliance. We also evaluate the proposed metrics against properties of software metrics, showing they provide fine-grained distinctions, enable nuanced comparisons, and are applicable across domains for code from any source, LLM or developer. Our results suggest that LLMs can assist in generating starter code for legally compliant smart contracts with strict reviews, and the proposed metrics provide a foundation for automated and self-improving development workflows.

Abstract: Decentralized learning has emerged as a powerful approach for handling large datasets across multiple machines in a communication-efficient manner. However, such methods often face scalability limitations, as increasing the number of machines beyond a certain point negatively impacts convergence rates. In this work, we propose Decentralized Anytime SGD, a novel decentralized learning algorithm that significantly extends the critical parallelism threshold, enabling the effective use of more machines without compromising performance. Within the stochastic convex optimization (SCO) framework, we establish a theoretical upper bound on parallelism that surpasses the current state-of-the-art, allowing larger networks to achieve favorable statistical guarantees and closing the gap with centralized learning in highly connected topologies.

<title>Protocol Models: Scaling Decentralized Training with Communication-Efficient Model Parallelism</title>

Abstract: Scaling models has led to significant advancements in deep learning, but training these models in decentralized settings remains challenging due to communication bottlenecks. While existing compression techniques are effective in data-parallel, they do not extend to model parallelism. Unlike data-parallel training, where weight gradients are exchanged, model-parallel requires compressing activations and activation gradients as they propagate through layers, accumulating compression errors. We propose a novel compression algorithm that compresses both forward and backward passes, enabling up to 99% compression with no convergence degradation with negligible memory/compute overhead. By leveraging a recursive structure in transformer networks, we predefine a low-dimensional subspace to confine the activations and gradients, allowing full reconstruction in subsequent layers. Our method achieves up to 100x improvement in communication efficiency and enables training billion-parameter-scale models over low-end GPUs connected via consumer-grade internet speeds as low as 80Mbps, matching the convergence of centralized datacenter systems with 100Gbps connections with model parallel.

<title>Quantitative Error Feedback for Quantization Noise Reduction of Filtering over Graphs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01404</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative error feedback framework designed to mitigate quantization noise in distributed graph filtering, where communications are constrained to quantized messages. It comes from error spectrum shaping techniques from state-space digital filters, and therefore establishes connections between quantized filtering processes over different domains. In contrast to existing error compensation methods, our framework quantitatively feeds back the quantization noise for exact compensation. We examine the framework under three key scenarios: (i) deterministic graph filtering, (ii) graph filtering over random graphs, and (iii) graph filtering with random node-asynchronous updates. Rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly reduces the effect of quantization noise, and we provide closed-form solutions for the optimal error feedback coefficients. Moreover, this quantitative error feedback mechanism can be seamlessly integrated into communication-efficient decentralized optimization frameworks, enabling lower error floors. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, consistently showing that our method outperforms conventional quantization strategies in terms of both accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: This research analyzes the economics of spam-based arbitrage strategies on fast-finality blockchains. We begin by theoretically demonstrating that, splitting a profitable MEV opportunity into multiple small transactions is the optimal strategy for CEX-DEX arbitrageurs. We then empirically validate these findings on major Ethereum rollups. To uncover the structure of reverted transactions, we construct execution graphs from transaction traces and systematically search them to identify DEX or router interactions and targeted liquidity pools. This analysis reveals that 80\% of reverted transactions are swaps with approximately 50\% targeting USDC-WETH pools on Uniswap v3/v4. These patterns intensified following the March 2024 Dencun upgrade, which lowered L2 gas costs and made spam-based arbitrage economically viable. Counterintuitively, we find that these reverted MEV transactions rarely engage with Priority Fee Auctions (PFAs), preferring to submit duplicate transactions rather than bid for inclusion. Moreover, reverted transactions cluster at the very top of blocks on fast rollups like Arbitrum and ZKsync, indicating an intense latency race and revealing the fragility of fee-based ordering under sub-second block times.

Abstract: With the rapid development of technology, the number of smart mobile users is increasing, accompanied by growing demands from applications such as virtual/augmented reality (VR/XR), remote surgery, autonomous vehicles, and real-time holographic communications, all of which require high transmission rates and ultra-low latency in 6G and beyond networks (6G+). This poses enormous challenges in efficiently deploying large-scale networks, including network design, planning, troubleshooting, optimization, and maintenance, without affecting the user experience. Network Digital Twin (NDT) has emerged as a potential solution, enabling the creation of a virtual model that reflects the actual network, supporting the simulation of various network designs, applying diverse operating policies, and reproducing complex fault scenarios under real-world conditions. This motivate us for this study, where we provide a comprehensive survey of NDT in the context of 6G+, covering areas such as radio access networks (RAN), transport networks, 5G core networks and beyond (5GCORE+), cloud/edge computing, applications (blockchain, health system, manufacturing, security, and vehicular networks), non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), and quantum networks, from both academic and industrial perspectives. In particular, we are the first to provide an in-depth guide and usage of RAN and 5GCORE+ for NDT. Then, we provide an extensive review of foundation technologies such as transport networks, cloud/edge computing, applications, NTNs, and quantum networks in NDT. Finally, we discuss the key challenges, open issues, and future research directions for NDT in the context of 6G+.

<title>Contrastive Learning for Efficient Transaction Validation in UTXO-based Blockchains</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01614</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01614</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Machine Learning (ML) approach for scalability of UTXO-based blockchains, such as Bitcoin. Prior approaches to UTXO set sharding struggle with distributing UTXOs effectively across validators, creating substantial communication overhead due to child-parent transaction dependencies. This overhead, which arises from the need to locate parent UTXOs, significantly hampers transaction processing speeds. Our solution uses ML to optimize not only UTXO set sharding but also the routing of incoming transactions, ensuring that transactions are directed to shards containing their parent UTXOs. At the heart of our approach is a framework that combines contrastive and unsupervised learning to create an embedding space for transaction outputs. This embedding allows the model to group transaction outputs based on spending relationships, making it possible to route transactions efficiently to the correct validation microservices. Trained on historical transaction data with triplet loss and online semi-hard negative mining, the model embeds parent-child spending patterns directly into its parameters, thus eliminating the need for costly, real-time parent transaction lookups. This significantly reduces cross-shard communication overhead, boosting throughput and scalability.

Abstract: Federated Unlearning (FU) enables clients to remove the influence of specific data from a collaboratively trained shared global model, addressing regulatory requirements such as GDPR and CCPA. However, this unlearning process introduces a new privacy risk: A malicious server may exploit unlearning updates to reconstruct the data requested for removal, a form of Data Reconstruction Attack (DRA). While DRAs for machine unlearning have been studied extensively in centralized Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) settings, their applicability to FU remains unclear due to the decentralized, client-driven nature of FU. This work presents DRAUN, the first attack framework to reconstruct unlearned data in FU systems. DRAUN targets optimization-based unlearning methods, which are widely adopted for their efficiency. We theoretically demonstrate why existing DRAs targeting machine unlearning in MLaaS fail in FU and show how DRAUN overcomes these limitations. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on four datasets and four model architectures, evaluating its performance against five popular unlearning methods, effectively demonstrating that state-of-the-art FU methods remain vulnerable to DRAs.

Abstract: This paper introduces FedGenGMM, a novel one-shot federated learning approach for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) tailored for unsupervised learning scenarios. In federated learning (FL), where multiple decentralized clients collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, significant challenges include statistical heterogeneity, high communication costs, and privacy concerns. FedGenGMM addresses these issues by allowing local GMM models, trained independently on client devices, to be aggregated through a single communication round. This approach leverages the generative property of GMMs, enabling the creation of a synthetic dataset on the server side to train a global model efficiently. Evaluation across diverse datasets covering image, tabular, and time series data demonstrates that FedGenGMM consistently achieves performance comparable to non-federated and iterative federated methods, even under significant data heterogeneity. Additionally, FedGenGMM significantly reduces communication overhead, maintains robust performance in anomaly detection tasks, and offers flexibility in local model complexities, making it particularly suitable for edge computing environments.

Abstract: As search, social media, and artificial intelligence continue to reshape collective knowledge, the preservation of trust on the public infosphere has become a defining challenge of our time. Given the breadth and versatility of adversarial threats, the best--and perhaps only--defense is an equally broad and versatile infrastructure for digital identity.
  This document discusses the opportunities and implications of building such an infrastructure from the perspective of a national laboratory. The technical foundation for this discussion is the emergence of the Synchronic Web, a Sandia-developed infrastructure for asserting cryptographic provenance at Internet scale. As of the writing of this document, there is ongoing work to develop the underlying technology and apply it to multiple mission-specific domains within Sandia. The primary objective of this document to extend the body of existing work toward the more public-facing domain of digital identity.
  Our approach depends on a non-standard, but philosophically defensible notion of identity: digital identity is an unbroken sequence of states in a well-defined digital space. From this foundation, we abstractly describe the infrastructural foundations and applied configurations that we expect to underpin future notions of digital identity.

Abstract: Smart contracts, the cornerstone of blockchain technology, enable secure, automated distributed execution. Given their role in handling large transaction volumes across clients, miners, and validators, exploring concurrency is critical. This includes concurrent transaction execution or validation within blocks, block processing across shards, and miner competition to select and persist transactions. Concurrency and parallelism are a double-edged sword: while they improve throughput, they also introduce risks like race conditions, non-determinism, and vulnerabilities such as deadlock and livelock.
  This paper presents the first survey of concurrency in smart contracts, offering a systematic literature review organized into key dimensions. First, it establishes a taxonomy of concurrency levels in blockchain systems and discusses proposed solutions for future adoption. Second, it examines vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures in concurrent operations, emphasizing the need for correctness and security. Crucially, we reveal a flawed concurrency assumption in a major research category, which has led to widespread misinterpretation. This work aims to correct that and guide future research toward more accurate models. Finally, we identify gaps in each category to outline future research directions and support blockchain's advancement.

Abstract: Low Altitude Economy (LAE) networks own transformative potential in urban mobility, emergency response, and aerial logistics. However, these networks face significant challenges in spectrum management, interference mitigation, and real-time coordination across dynamic and resource-constrained environments. After addressing these challenges, this study explores three core elements for enabling intelligent LAE networks as follows machine learning-based spectrum sensing and coexistence, artificial intelligence (AI)-optimized resource allocation and trajectory planning, and testbed-driven validation and standardization. We highlight how federated and reinforcement learning techniques support decentralized, adaptive decision-making under mobility and energy constraints. In addition, we discuss the role of real-world platforms such as AERPAW in bridging the gap between simulation and deployment and enabling iterative system refinement under realistic conditions. This study aims to provide a forward-looking roadmap toward developing efficient and interoperable AI-driven LAE ecosystems.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Proof of Sampling (PoSP) protocol, a Nash Equilibrium-based verification mechanism, and its application to decentralized machine learning inference through spML. Our protocol has a pure strategy Nash Equilibrium, compelling rational participants to act honestly. It economically disincentivizes dishonest behavior, making it costly for participants to compromise the network's integrity. In our spML protocol, we apply PoSP to decentralized inference for AI applications via a novel cryptographic protocol. The resulting protocol is much more efficient than zero knowledge proof based approaches. Moreover, we anticipate that the PoSP protocol could be effectively utilized for designing verification mechanisms within Actively Validated Services (AVS) in restaking solutions. We further expect that the PoSP protocol could be applied to a variety of other decentralized applications. Our approach enhances the reliability and efficiency of decentralized systems, paving the way for a new generation of decentralized applications.

Abstract: One of the biggest challenges of building artificial intelligence (AI) model in healthcare area is the data sharing. Since healthcare data is private, sensitive, and heterogeneous, collecting sufficient data for modelling is exhausted, costly, and sometimes impossible. In this paper, we propose a framework for global healthcare modelling using datasets from multi-continents (Europe, North America and Asia) while without sharing the local datasets, and choose glucose management as a study model to verify its effectiveness. Technically, blockchain-enabled federated learning is implemented with adaption to make it meet with the privacy and safety requirements of healthcare data, meanwhile rewards honest participation and penalize malicious activities using its on-chain incentive mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is effective, efficient, and privacy preserved. Its prediction accuracy is much better than the models trained from limited personal data and is similar to, and even slightly better than, the results from a centralized dataset. This work paves the way for international collaborations on healthcare projects, where additional data is crucial for reducing bias and providing benefits to humanity.

Abstract: While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offer computationally efficient adaptations of Large Language Models (LLMs), their practical deployment often assumes centralized data and training environments. However, real-world scenarios frequently involve distributed, privacy-sensitive datasets that require decentralized solutions. Federated learning (FL) addresses data privacy by coordinating model updates across clients, but it is typically based on centralized aggregation through a parameter server, which can introduce bottlenecks and communication constraints. Decentralized learning, in contrast, eliminates this dependency by enabling direct collaboration between clients, improving scalability and efficiency in distributed environments. Despite its advantages, decentralized LLM fine-tuning remains underexplored. In this work, we propose Dec-LoRA, a decentralized fine-tuning algorithm for LLMs based on LoRA. Through extensive experiments on BERT and LLaMA-2 models, we demonstrate that Dec-LoRA achieves performance comparable to centralized LoRA under various conditions, including data heterogeneity and quantization constraints. Additionally, we provide a rigorous theoretical guarantee proving the convergence of our algorithm to a stationary point for non-convex and smooth loss functions. These findings highlight the potential of Dec-LoRA for scalable LLM fine-tuning in decentralized environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be very capable, but access to frontier models currently relies on inference providers. This introduces trust challenges: how can we be sure that the provider is using the model configuration they claim? We propose TOPLOC, a novel method for verifiable inference that addresses this problem. TOPLOC leverages a compact locality-sensitive hashing mechanism for intermediate activations, which can detect unauthorized modifications to models, prompts, or precision with 100% accuracy, achieving no false positives or negatives in our empirical evaluations. Our approach is robust across diverse hardware configurations, GPU types, and algebraic reorderings, which allows for validation speeds significantly faster than the original inference. By introducing a polynomial encoding scheme, TOPLOC minimizes the memory overhead of the generated proofs by $1000\times$, requiring only 258 bytes of storage per 32 new tokens, compared to the 262 KB requirement of storing the token embeddings directly for Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct. Our method empowers users to verify LLM inference computations efficiently, fostering greater trust and transparency in open ecosystems and laying a foundation for decentralized, verifiable and trustless AI services.

Abstract: This paper focuses on Zero-Trust Foundation Models (ZTFMs), a novel paradigm that embeds zero-trust security principles into the lifecycle of foundation models (FMs) for Internet of Things (IoT) systems. By integrating core tenets, such as continuous verification, least privilege access (LPA), data confidentiality, and behavioral analytics into the design, training, and deployment of FMs, ZTFMs can enable secure, privacy-preserving AI across distributed, heterogeneous, and potentially adversarial IoT environments. We present the first structured synthesis of ZTFMs, identifying their potential to transform conventional trust-based IoT architectures into resilient, self-defending ecosystems. Moreover, we propose a comprehensive technical framework, incorporating federated learning (FL), blockchain-based identity management, micro-segmentation, and trusted execution environments (TEEs) to support decentralized, verifiable intelligence at the network edge. In addition, we investigate emerging security threats unique to ZTFM-enabled systems and evaluate countermeasures, such as anomaly detection, adversarial training, and secure aggregation. Through this analysis, we highlight key open research challenges in terms of scalability, secure orchestration, interpretable threat attribution, and dynamic trust calibration. This survey lays a foundational roadmap for secure, intelligent, and trustworthy IoT infrastructures powered by FMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving into autonomous agents that cooperate across organizational boundaries, enabling joint disaster response, supply-chain optimization, and other tasks that demand decentralized expertise without surrendering data ownership. Yet, cross-domain collaboration shatters the unified trust assumptions behind current alignment and containment techniques. An agent benign in isolation may, when receiving messages from an untrusted peer, leak secrets or violate policy, producing risks driven by emergent multi-agent dynamics rather than classical software bugs. This position paper maps the security agenda for cross-domain multi-agent LLM systems. We introduce seven categories of novel security challenges, for each of which we also present plausible attacks, security evaluation metrics, and future research guidelines.

Abstract: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) is a decentralized machine learning approach where multiple clients train a model collaboratively. PPFL preserves privacy and security of the client's data by not exchanging it. However, ensuring that data at each client is of high quality and ready for federated learning (FL) is a challenge due to restricted data access. In this paper, we introduce CADRE (Customizable Assurance of Data REadiness) for FL, a novel framework that allows users to define custom data readiness (DR) standards, metrics, rules, and remedies tailored to specific FL tasks. Our framework generates comprehensive DR reports based on the user-defined metrics, rules, and remedies to ensure datasets are optimally prepared for FL while preserving privacy. We demonstrate the framework's practical application by integrating it into an existing PPFL framework. We conducted experiments across six diverse datasets, addressing seven different DR issues. The results illustrate the framework's versatility and effectiveness in ensuring DR across various dimensions, including data quality, privacy, and fairness. This approach enhances the performance and reliability of FL models as well as utilizes valuable resources by identifying and addressing data-related issues before the training phase.

Abstract: This paper studies the networked multi-agent reinforcement learning (NMARL) problem, where the objective of agents is to collaboratively maximize the discounted average cumulative rewards. Different from the existing methods that suffer from poor expression due to linear function approximation, we propose a distributed neural policy gradient algorithm that features two innovatively designed neural networks, specifically for the approximate Q-functions and policy functions of agents. This distributed neural policy gradient algorithm consists of two key components: the distributed critic step and the decentralized actor step. In the distributed critic step, agents receive the approximate Q-function parameters from their neighboring agents via a time-varying communication networks to collaboratively evaluate the joint policy. In contrast, in the decentralized actor step, each agent updates its local policy parameter solely based on its own approximate Q-function. In the convergence analysis, we first establish the global convergence of agents for the joint policy evaluation in the distributed critic step. Subsequently, we rigorously demonstrate the global convergence of the overall distributed neural policy gradient algorithm with respect to the objective function. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it with a centralized algorithm through simulation in the robot path planning environment.

<title>Transaction Proximity: A Graph-Based Approach to Blockchain Fraud Prevention</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces a fraud-deterrent access validation system for public blockchains, leveraging two complementary concepts: "Transaction Proximity", which measures the distance between wallets in the transaction graph, and "Easily Attainable Identities (EAIs)", wallets with direct transaction connections to centralized exchanges. Recognizing the limitations of traditional approaches like blocklisting (reactive, slow) and strict allow listing (privacy-invasive, adoption barriers), we propose a system that analyzes transaction patterns to identify wallets with close connections to centralized exchanges.
  Our directed graph analysis of the Ethereum blockchain reveals that 56% of large USDC wallets (with a lifetime maximum balance greater than \$10,000) are EAI and 88% are within one transaction hop of an EAI. For transactions exceeding \$2,000, 91% involve at least one EAI. Crucially, an analysis of past exploits shows that 83% of the known exploiter addresses are not EAIs, with 21% being more than five hops away from any regulated exchange. We present three implementation approaches with varying gas cost and privacy tradeoffs, demonstrating that EAI-based access control can potentially prevent most of these incidents while preserving blockchain openness. Importantly, our approach does not restrict access or share personally identifiable information, but it provides information for protocols to implement their own validation or risk scoring systems based on specific needs. This middle-ground solution enables programmatic compliance while maintaining the core values of open blockchain.

<title>Verifiable Weighted Secret Sharing</title>

Abstract: Traditionally, threshold secret sharing (TSS) schemes assume all parties have equal weight, yet emerging systems like blockchains reveal disparities in party trustworthiness, such as stake or reputation. Weighted Secret Sharing (WSS) addresses this by assigning varying weights to parties, ensuring security even if adversaries control parties with total weight at most a threshold $t$. Current WSS schemes assume honest dealers, resulting in security from only honest-but-curious behaviour but not protection from malicious adversaries for downstream applications. \emph{Verifiable} secret sharing (VSS) is a well-known technique to address this, but existing VSS schemes are either tailored to TSS, or require additional trust assumptions. We propose the first efficient verifiable WSS scheme that tolerates malicious dealers and is compatible with the latest CRT-based WSS~\cite{crypto_w_weights}. Our solution uses Bulletproofs for efficient verification and introduces new privacy-preserving techniques for proving relations between committed values, which may be of independent interest. Evaluation on Ethereum show up to a $100\times$ improvement in communication complexity compared to the current design and $20\times$ improvement compared to unweighted VSS schemes.

Abstract: To alleviate difficulties in writing smart contracts for distributed blockchain applications, as other research, we propose transformation of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) models into blockchain smart contracts. Unlike other research, we use Discrete Event Hierarchical State Machine (DE-HSM) multi-modal modeling to identify collaborative trade transactions that need to be supported by the smart contract and describe how the trade transactions, that may be nested, are supported by a transaction mechanism. We describe algorithms to (i) identify the nested trade transactions and to (ii) transform the BPMN model into blockchains smart contracts that include a transaction mechanism to enforce the transactional properties for the identified trade transactions. The developed proof of concept shows that our approach to automated transformation of BPMN models into smart contracts with the support of privacy and cross-chain interoperability is feasible. The thesis examines and evaluates automatically generated alternative transaction mechanisms to support such transactions using three use cases of varying degree of complexity, namely order processing, supply chain management, and a multi-faceted trade use case. The research enriches the academic dialogue on blockchain technology and smart contracts and proposes potential avenues for future research.

<title>Singularity Protocol for Cross Chain AMM without Intermediate Tokens or Bridges</title>

Abstract: Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are decentralized exchange protocols that provide continuous access to token liquidity without the need for order books or traditional market makers. However, this innovation has failed to scale when it comes to cross-chain swaps. Modern cross-chain swaps employ double-sided AMMs, which are not only inefficient due to liquidity fragmentation but also require an intermediate token. This introduces inherent volatility risk as well as blockchain and bridging risk, especially in the case of wrapped tokens. This paper describes the inefficiencies of existing AMM invariants, particularly their mixed polynomial nature, and derives a new class of AMMs that do not have bi-state dependency between the assets being swapped. We propose a novel method of value transfer swaps using the described invariant that mitigates the need for bi-state dependency and eliminates the need for intermediate tokens or bridging. Furthermore, we show how this mechanism enables efficient cross-chain swaps with lower gas requirements and no bridging risks. The proposed technology is designed to support cross-chain swaps across any permutation of L1, L2, and L3 blockchains.

<title>Looking for Attention: Randomized Attention Test Design for Validator Monitoring in Optimistic Rollups</title>

Abstract: Optimistic Rollups (ORUs) significantly enhance blockchain scalability but inherently suffer from the verifier's dilemma, particularly concerning validator attentiveness. Current systems lack mechanisms to proactively ensure validators are diligently monitoring L2 state transitions, creating a vulnerability where fraudulent states could be finalized. This paper introduces the Randomized Attention Test (RAT), a novel L1-based protocol designed to probabilistically challenge validators in ORUs, thereby verifying their liveness and computational readiness. Our game-theoretic analysis demonstrates that an Ideal Security Equilibrium, where all validators are attentive and proposers are honest, can be achieved with RAT. Notably, this equilibrium is attainable and stable with relatively low economic penalties (e.g., under $1000) for non-responsive validators and a low attention test frequency (e.g., under 1% per epoch). RAT thus provides a crucial, practical mechanism to enforce validator diligence, fortifying the overall security and integrity of ORU systems with minimizing additional costs.

Abstract: Blockchain protocols incentivize participation through monetary rewards, assuming rational actors behave honestly to maximize their gains. However, attackers may attempt to harm others even at personal cost. These denial of profit attacks aim to reduce the rewards of honest participants, potentially forcing them out of the system. While existing work has largely focused on the profitability of attacks, they often neglect the potential harm inflicted on the victim, which can be significant even when the attacker gains little or nothing.
  This paper introduces a framework to quantify denial of profit attacks by measuring both attacker cost and victim loss. We model these attacks as a game and introduce relevant metrics to quantify these attacks. We then focus on committee-based blockchains and model vote collection as a game. We show that in the vote collection game, disincentivizing one denial of profit attack will make another attack more appealing, and therefore, attacks have to be balanced. We apply our framework to analyze real-world reward mechanisms in Ethereum and Cosmos. Our framework reveals imbalances in Cosmos that can make correct behavior suboptimal in practice. While Ethereum provides stronger protections, our framework shows that it is also not complete, and we propose alternative parameter settings to improve the balance between attacks. Our findings highlight the need for better-balanced reward designs to defend against denial of profit attacks.

<title>Explaining Sustained Blockchain Decentralization with Quasi-Experiments: Resource Flexibility of Consensus Mechanisms</title>

Abstract: Decentralization is a fundamental design element of the Web3 economy. Blockchains and distributed consensus mechanisms are touted as fault-tolerant, attack-resistant, and collusion-proof because they are decentralized. Recent analyses, however, find some blockchains are decentralized, others are centralized, and that there are trends towards both centralization and decentralization in the blockchain economy. Despite the importance and variability of decentralization across blockchains, we still know little about what enables or constrains blockchain decentralization. We hypothesize that the resource flexibility of consensus mechanisms is a key enabler of the sustained decentralization of blockchain networks. We test this hypothesis using three quasi-experimental shocks -- policy-related, infrastructure-related, and technical -- to resources used in consensus. We find strong suggestive evidence that the resource flexibility of consensus mechanisms enables sustained blockchain decentralization and discuss the implications for the design, regulation, and implementation of blockchains.

Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness and long-term verifiability of scientific data is a foundational challenge in the era of data-intensive, collaborative research. Provenance metadata plays a key role in this context, capturing the origin, transformation, and usage of research artifacts. However, existing solutions often fall short when applied to distributed, multi-institutional settings. This paper introduces a modular, domain-agnostic architecture for provenance tracking in federated environments, leveraging permissioned blockchain infrastructure to guarantee integrity, immutability, and auditability. The system supports decentralized interaction, persistent identifiers for artifact traceability, and a provenance versioning model that preserves the history of updates. Designed to interoperate with diverse scientific domains, the architecture promotes transparency, accountability, and reproducibility across organizational boundaries. Ongoing work focuses on validating the system through a distributed prototype and exploring its performance in collaborative settings.

Abstract: Identity verification in Data Spaces is a fundamental aspect of ensuring security and privacy in digital environments. This paper presents an identity verification protocol tailored for shared data environments within Data Spaces. This protocol extends the Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol (GNAP) and integrates OpenID Connect for Verifiable Presentations (OIDC4VP) along with support for Linked Verifiable Presentations (LVP), providing a robust foundation for secure and privacy-preserving interactions. The proposed solution adheres to the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) to facilitate decentralized, user-centric identity management while maintaining flexibility through protocol negotiation. Two alternative interaction flows are introduced: a "Wallet-Driven Interaction" utilizing OIDC4VP, and a "LVP Authorization" model for fully automated machine-to-machine communication. These flows address critical challenges encountered in Data Spaces, including privacy, interoperability, and regulatory compliance while simultaneously ensuring scalability and minimizing trust assumptions. The paper provides a detailed technical design, outlining the implementation considerations, and demonstrating how the proposed flows guarantee verifiable, secure, and efficient interactions between participants. This work contributes towards the establishment of a more trustworthy and sovereign digital infrastructure, in alignment with emerging European data governance initiatives.

<title>Talking Transactions: Decentralized Communication through Ethereum Input Data Messages (IDMs)</title>

arXiv:2505.24724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can you imagine, blockchain transactions can talk! In this paper, we study how they talk and what they talk about. We focus on the input data field of Ethereum transactions, which is designed to allow external callers to interact with smart contracts. In practice, this field also enables users to embed natural language messages into transactions. Users can leverage these Input Data Messages (IDMs) for peer-to-peer communication. This means that, beyond Ethereum's well-known role as a financial infrastructure, it also serves as a decentralized communication medium.
  We present the first large-scale analysis of Ethereum IDMs from the genesis block to February 2024 (3134 days). We filter IDMs to extract 867,140 transactions with informative IDMs and use LLMs for language detection. We find that English (95.4%) and Chinese (4.4%) dominate the use of natural languages in IDMs. Interestingly, English IDMs center on security and scam warnings (24%) with predominantly negative emotions, while Chinese IDMs emphasize emotional expression and social connection (44%) with a more positive tone. We also observe that longer English IDMs often transfer high ETH values for protocol-level purposes, while longer Chinese IDMs tend to involve symbolic transfer amounts for emotional intent. Moreover, we find that the IDM participants tend to form small, loosely connected communities (59.99%). Our findings highlight culturally and functionally divergent use cases of the IDM channel across user communities. We further examine the security relevance of IDMs in on-chain attacks. Many victims use them to appeal to attackers for fund recovery. IDMs containing negotiations or reward offers are linked to higher reply rates. We also analyze IDMs' regulatory implications. Their misuse for abuse, threats, and sexual solicitation reveals the urgent need for content moderation and regulation in decentralized systems.

<title>AFLoRA: Adaptive Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models with Resource-Aware Low-Rank Adaption</title>

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach to adapt foundation models to downstream tasks using decentralized data. However, real-world deployment remains challenging due to the high computational and communication demands of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on clients with data and system resources that are heterogeneous and constrained. In such settings, the global model's performance is often bottlenecked by the weakest clients and further degraded by the non-IID nature of local data. Although existing methods leverage parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce communication and computation overhead, they often fail to simultaneously ensure accurate aggregation of low-rank updates and maintain low system costs, thereby hindering overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose AFLoRA, an adaptive and lightweight federated fine-tuning framework for LLMs. AFLoRA decouples shared and client-specific updates to reduce overhead and improve aggregation accuracy, incorporates diagonal matrix-based rank pruning to better utilize local resources, and employs rank-aware aggregation with public data refinement to strengthen generalization under data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AFLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a practical solution for efficient LLM adaptation in heterogeneous environments in the real world.

Abstract: In a Proof-of-Work blockchain such as Bitcoin mining hashrate is increasing in the block reward. An increase in hashrate reduces network vulnerability to attack (a reduction in security cost) while increasing carbon emissions and electricity cost (an increase in externalities cost). This implies a tradeoff in total cost at different levels of hashrate and the existence of a hashrate interval where total cost is minimized. Targeted Nakamoto is a Proof-of-Work protocol augmentation that incentivizes miners to hone in on a target hashrate interval. When hashrate is above target a ceiling is placed on the block reward a miner can receive. When hashrate is below target a floor is placed underneath the miner's block reward. Monetary neutrality is maintained by a proportional increase in spending potential among addresses holding UTXO's to match a deduction from total block reward when the ceiling is operative and a proportional reduction in spending potential among addresses holding UTXO's to match an increase over the total block reward when the floor is binding.

Abstract: Recent manufacturing systems are increasingly adopting multi-robot collaboration to handle complex and dynamic environments. While multi-agent architectures support decentralized coordination among robot agents, they often face challenges in enabling real-time adaptability for unexpected disruptions without predefined rules. Recent advances in large language models offer new opportunities for context-aware decision-making to enable adaptive responses to unexpected changes. This paper presents an initial exploratory implementation of a large language model-enabled control framework for dynamic task reassignment in multi-robot manufacturing systems. A central controller agent leverages the large language model's ability to interpret structured robot configuration data and generate valid reassignments in response to robot failures. Experiments in a real-world setup demonstrate high task success rates in recovering from failures, highlighting the potential of this approach to improve adaptability in multi-robot manufacturing systems.

Abstract: Calls to decentralize feed-based social media have been driven by concerns about the concentrated power of centralized platforms and their societal impact. In response, numerous decentralized social media protocols have emerged, each interpreting "decentralization" in different ways. We analyze four such protocols -- ActivityPub, AT Protocol, Nostr, and Farcaster -- to develop a novel conceptual framework for understanding how protocols operationalize decentralization. Drawing from protocol documentation, media coverage, and first-hand interviews with protocol developers and experts, we contextualize each protocol's approach within their respective socio-technical goals. Our framework highlights how control over key components is distributed differently across each protocol, shaping who holds power over what kinds of decisions. How components are arranged in relation to one another further impacts how component owners might offset each other's power in shaping social media. We argue that examining protocols as artifacts reveals how values shape infrastructure and power dynamics -- and that with a holistic framework as a guide, we can more effectively evaluate and design decentralized platforms aligned with the social and political futures we envision.

Abstract: Modern blockchain applications are often constrained by a trade-off between user experience and trust. Chainless Apps present a new paradigm of application architecture that separates execution, trust, bridging, and settlement into distinct compostable layers. This enables app-specific sequencing, verifiable off-chain computation, chain-agnostic asset and message routing via Agglayer, and finality on Ethereum - resulting in fast Web2-like UX with Web3-grade verifiability. Although consensus mechanisms have historically underpinned verifiable computation, the advent of zkVMs and decentralized validation services opens up new trust models for developers. Chainless Apps leverage this evolution to offer modular, scalable applications that maintain interoperability with the broader blockchain ecosystem while allowing domain-specific trade-offs.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train models without sharing their data. Measuring participant contributions in FL is crucial for incentivizing clients and ensuring transparency. While various methods have been proposed for contribution measurement, they are designed exclusively for centralized federated learning (CFL), where a central server collects and aggregates client models, along with evaluating their contributions. Meanwhile, decentralized federated learning (DFL), in which clients exchange models directly without a central server, has gained significant attention for mitigating communication bottlenecks and eliminating a single point of failure. However, applying existing contribution measurement methods to DFL is challenging due to the presence of multiple global models and the absence of a central server. In this study, we present novel methodologies for measuring participant contributions in DFL. We first propose DFL-Shapley, an extension of the Shapley value tailored for DFL, adapting this widely used CFL metric to decentralized settings. Given the impracticality of computing the ideal DFL-Shapley in real-world systems, we introduce DFL-MR, a computable approximation that estimates overall contributions by accumulating round-wise Shapley values. We evaluate DFL-Shapley and DFL-MR across various FL scenarios and compare them with existing CFL metrics. The experimental results confirm DFL-Shapley as a valid ground-truth metric and demonstrate DFL-MR's proximity to DFL-Shapley across various settings, highlighting their effectiveness as contribution metrics in DFL.

Abstract: In next-generation wireless networks, supporting real-time applications such as augmented reality, autonomous driving, and immersive Metaverse services demands stringent constraints on bandwidth, latency, and reliability. Existing semantic communication (SemCom) approaches typically rely on static models, overlooking dynamic conditions and contextual cues vital for efficient transmission. To address these challenges, we propose CaSemCom, a context-aware SemCom framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM)-based gating mechanism and a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to adaptively select and encode only high-impact semantic features across multiple data modalities. Our multimodal, multi-user case study demonstrates that CaSemCom significantly improves reconstructed image fidelity while reducing bandwidth usage, outperforming single-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods and traditional baselines in convergence speed, semantic accuracy, and retransmission overhead.

Abstract: This work explores the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Unsupervised Semantic image Segmentation (USS). Recent USS methods extract pixel-level features using frozen visual foundation models and refine them through self-supervised objectives that encourage semantic grouping. These features are then grouped to semantic clusters to produce segmentation masks. Extending these ideas to federated settings requires feature representation and cluster centroid alignment across distributed clients -- an inherently difficult task under heterogeneous data distributions in the absence of supervision. To address this, we propose FUSS Federated Unsupervised image Semantic Segmentation) which is, to our knowledge, the first framework to enable fully decentralized, label-free semantic segmentation training. FUSS introduces novel federation strategies that promote global consistency in feature and prototype space, jointly optimizing local segmentation heads and shared semantic centroids. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, including binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, show that FUSS consistently outperforms local-only client trainings as well as extensions of classical FL algorithms under varying client data distributions. To support reproducibility, full code will be released upon manuscript acceptance.

Abstract: We present the first formal treatment of \emph{yield tokenization}, a mechanism that decomposes yield-bearing assets into principal and yield components to facilitate risk transfer and price discovery in decentralized finance (DeFi). We propose a model that characterizes yield token dynamics using stochastic differential equations. We derive a no-arbitrage pricing framework for yield tokens, enabling their use in hedging future yield volatility and managing interest rate risk in decentralized lending pools. Taking DeFi lending as our focus, we show how both borrowers and lenders can use yield tokens to achieve optimal hedging outcomes and mitigate exposure to adversarial interest rate manipulation. Furthermore, we design automated market makers (AMMs) that incorporate a menu of bonding curves to aggregate liquidity from participants with heterogeneous risk preferences. This leads to an efficient and incentive-compatible mechanism for trading yield tokens and yield futures. Building on these foundations, we propose a modular \textit{fixed-rate} lending protocol that synthesizes on-chain yield token markets and lending pools, enabling robust interest rate discovery and enhancing capital efficiency. Our work provides the theoretical underpinnings for risk management and fixed-income infrastructure in DeFi, offering practical mechanisms for stable and sustainable yield markets.

Abstract: We present a model of a market that is intermediated by broker-dealers where there is multiple equilibrium. We then design a smart-contract that receives messages and algorithmically sends trading instructions. The smart-contract resolves the multiple equilibrium by implementing broker-dealer joint profit maximization as a Nash equilibrium. This outcome relies upon several factors: Agent commitments to follow the smart contract protocol; selective privacy of information; a structured timing of trade offers and acceptances and, crucially, trust that the smart-contract will execute the correct algorithm. Commitment is achieved by a legal contract or contingent deposit that incentivizes agents to comply with the protocol. Privacy is maintained by using fully homomorphic encryption. Multiple equilibrium is resolved by imposing a sequential ordering of trade offers and acceptances, and trust in the smart-contract is achieved by appending the smart-contract to a public blockchain, thereby enabling verification of its computations. This model serves as an example of how a smart-contract implemented with cryptography and blockchain can improve market outcomes.

Abstract: This research proposed a data-driven supply chain disruption response baseline framework based on intelligent recommender system technology as an initial SCRes reactive solution. To improve the data quality and reliability of the proposed IRS as a stable, secure, and resilient decision support system, blockchain technology is integrated into the baseline architecture. The smart contract is prototyped to demonstrate the information exchange mechanism under a BLC network environment. The BLC-IRS framework is then implemented with an industrial case to demonstrate its executable function. A system dynamics (SD) simulation model is adopted to validate the BLC-IRS framework as an effective digital SCRes enhancement measure. The simulation results indicated that the proposed BLC-IRS framework can be effectively implemented as a SC disruption mitigation measure in the SCRes response phase as reactive measure, enabling SC participants to react better to SC disruptions at the physical level. Compared to previous studies that limited at the conceptual level as the proactive SCRes measure with a standalone fashion, the developed BLC-IRS contributes an executable SCRes digital solution with synthetic technologies as a reactive SCRes measure for the SCRes community, by identifying the internal and external supplementary resource information in an agile, safe, and real-time manner after SC disruption.

Abstract: Social conventions are the backbone of social coordination, shaping how individuals form a group. As growing populations of artificial intelligence (AI) agents communicate through natural language, a fundamental question is whether they can bootstrap the foundations of a society. Here, we present experimental results that demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of universally adopted social conventions in decentralized populations of large language model (LLM) agents. We then show how strong collective biases can emerge during this process, even when agents exhibit no bias individually. Last, we examine how committed minority groups of adversarial LLM agents can drive social change by imposing alternative social conventions on the larger population. Our results show that AI systems can autonomously develop social conventions without explicit programming and have implications for designing AI systems that align, and remain aligned, with human values and societal goals.

Abstract: We describe an incentive system for distributed deep learning of foundational models where peers are rewarded for contributions. The incentive system, \textit{Gauntlet}, has been deployed on the bittensor blockchain and used to train a 1.2B LLM with completely permissionless contributions of pseudo-gradients: no control over the users that can register or their hardware. \textit{Gauntlet} can be applied to any synchronous distributed training scheme that relies on aggregating updates or pseudo-gradients. We rely on a two-stage mechanism for fast filtering of peer uptime, reliability, and synchronization, combined with the core component that estimates the loss before and after individual pseudo-gradient contributions. We utilized an OpenSkill rating system to track competitiveness of pseudo-gradient scores across time. Finally, we introduce a novel mechanism to ensure peers on the network perform unique computations. Our live 1.2B run, which has paid out real-valued tokens to participants based on the value of their contributions, yielded a competitive (on a per-iteration basis) 1.2B model that demonstrates the utility of our incentive system.

Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), effective communication improves agent performance, particularly under partial observability. We propose MARL-CPC, a framework that enables communication among fully decentralized, independent agents without parameter sharing. MARL-CPC incorporates a message learning model based on collective predictive coding (CPC) from emergent communication research. Unlike conventional methods that treat messages as part of the action space and assume cooperation, MARL-CPC links messages to state inference, supporting communication in non-cooperative, reward-independent settings. We introduce two algorithms -Bandit-CPC and IPPO-CPC- and evaluate them in non-cooperative MARL tasks. Benchmarks show that both outperform standard message-as-action approaches, establishing effective communication even when messages offer no direct benefit to the sender. These results highlight MARL-CPC's potential for enabling coordination in complex, decentralized environments.

<title>BPMN to Smart Contract by Business Analyst</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of creating smart contracts for applications represented using Business Process Management and Notation (BPMN) models. In our prior work we presented a methodology that automates the generation of smart contracts from BPMN models. This approach abstracts the BPMN flow control, making it independent of the underlying blockchain infrastructure, with only the BPMN task elements requiring coding. In subsequent research, we enhanced our approach by adding support for nested transactions and enabling a smart contract repair and/or upgrade. To empower Business Analysts (BAs) to generate smart contracts without relying on software developers, we tackled the challenge of generating smart contracts from BPMN models without assistance of a software developer. We exploit the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard to represent the decisions and the business logic of the BPMN task elements and amended our methodology for transformation of BPMN models into smart contracts to support also the generation script to represent the business logic represented by the DMN models. To support such transformation, we describe how the BA documents, using the BPMN elements, the flow of information along with the flow of execution. Thus, if the BA is successful in representing the blockchain application requirements using BPMN and DMN models, our methodology and the tool, called TABS, that we developed as a proof of concept, is used to generate the smart contracts directly from those models without developer assistance.

Abstract: Research on blockchains addresses multiple issues, with one being writing smart contracts. In our previous research we described methodology and a tool to generate, in automated fashion, smart contracts from BPMN models. The generated smart contracts provide support for multi-step transactions that facilitate repair/upgrade of smart contracts. In this paper we show how the approach is used to support collaborations via smart contracts for companies ranging from SMEs with little IT capabilities to companies with IT using blockchain smart contracts. Furthermore, we also show how the approach is used for certain applications to generate smart contracts by a BPMN modeler who does not need any knowledge of blockchain technology or smart contract development - thus we are hoping to facilitate democratization of smart contracts and blockchain technology.

Abstract: We improve a flocking model on street networks introduced in a previous paper. We expand the field of vision of walkers, making the model more realistic. Under such conditions, we obtain groups of walkers whose gathering times and robustness to break ups are better than previous results. We explain such improvements because the alignment rule with vision guaranties walkers do not split into divergent directions at intersections anymore, and because the attraction rule with vision gathers distant groups. This paves the way to a better understanding of events where walkers have collective decentralized goals, like protests.

Abstract: The automated generation of radiology reports from chest X-ray images holds significant promise in enhancing diagnostic workflows while preserving patient privacy. Traditional centralized approaches often require sensitive data transfer, posing privacy concerns. To address this, the study proposes a Multimodal Federated Learning framework for chest X-ray report generation using the IU-Xray dataset. The system utilizes a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the encoder and GPT-2 as the report generator, enabling decentralized training without sharing raw data. Three Federated Learning (FL) aggregation strategies: FedAvg, Krum Aggregation and a novel Loss-aware Federated Averaging (L-FedAvg) were evaluated. Among these, Krum Aggregation demonstrated superior performance across lexical and semantic evaluation metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore and RaTEScore. The results show that FL can match or surpass centralized models in generating clinically relevant and semantically rich radiology reports. This lightweight and privacy-preserving framework paves the way for collaborative medical AI development without compromising data confidentiality.

Abstract: Recent research in consensus has often focussed on protocols for State-Machine-Replication (SMR) that can handle high throughputs. Such state-of-the-art protocols (generally DAG-based) induce undue overhead when the needed throughput is low, or else exhibit unnecessarily-poor latency and communication complexity during periods of low throughput.
  Here we present Morpheus Consensus, which naturally morphs from a quiescent low-throughput leaderless blockchain protocol to a high-throughput leader-based DAG protocol and back, excelling in latency and complexity in both settings. During high-throughout, Morpheus pars with state-of-the-art DAG-based protocols, including Autobahn. During low-throughput, Morpheus exhibits competitive complexity and lower latency than standard protocols such as PBFT and Tendermint, which in turn do not perform well during high-throughput.
  The key idea of Morpheus is that as long as blocks do not conflict (due to Byzantine behaviour, network delays, or high-throughput simultaneous production) it produces a forkless blockchain, promptly finalizing each block upon arrival. It assigns a leader only if one is needed to resolve conflicts, in a manner and with performance not unlike Autobahn.

Abstract: A challenging problem in decentralized optimization is to develop algorithms with fast convergence on random and time varying topologies under unreliable and bandwidth-constrained communication network. This paper studies a stochastic approximation approach with a Fully Stochastic Primal Dual Algorithm (FSPDA) framework. Our framework relies on a novel observation that randomness in time varying topology can be incorporated in a stochastic augmented Lagrangian formulation, whose expected value admits saddle points that coincide with stationary solutions of the decentralized optimization problem. With the FSPDA framework, we develop two new algorithms supporting efficient sparsified communication on random time varying topologies -- FSPDA-SA allows agents to execute multiple local gradient steps depending on the time varying topology to accelerate convergence, and FSPDA-STORM further incorporates a variance reduction step to improve sample complexity. For problems with smooth (possibly non-convex) objective function, within $T$ iterations, we show that FSPDA-SA (resp. FSPDA-STORM) finds an $\mathcal{O}( 1/\sqrt{T} )$-stationary (resp. $\mathcal{O}( 1/T^{2/3} )$) solution. Numerical experiments show the benefits of the FSPDA algorithms.

Abstract: This paper introduces EarthOL, a novel consensus protocol that attempts to replace computational waste in blockchain systems with verifiable human contributions within bounded domains. While recognizing the fundamental impossibility of universal value assessment, we propose a domain-restricted approach that acknowledges cultural diversity and subjective preferences while maintaining cryptographic security. Our enhanced Proof-of-Human-Contribution (PoHC) protocol uses a multi-layered verification system with domain-specific evaluation criteria, time-dependent validation mechanisms, and comprehensive security frameworks. We present theoretical analysis demonstrating meaningful progress toward incentive-compatible human contribution verification in high-consensus domains, achieving Byzantine fault tolerance in controlled scenarios while addressing significant scalability and cultural bias challenges. Through game-theoretic analysis, probabilistic modeling, and enhanced security protocols, we identify specific conditions under which the protocol remains stable and examine failure modes with comprehensive mitigation strategies. This work contributes to understanding the boundaries of decentralized value assessment and provides a framework for future research in human-centered consensus mechanisms for specific application domains, with particular emphasis on validator and security specialist incentive systems.

Abstract: CLASS is a proof-of-concept general purpose linear programming language, flexibly supporting realistic concurrent programming idioms, and featuring an expressive linear type system ensuring that programs (1) never misuse or leak stateful resources or memory, (2) never deadlock, and (3) always terminate. The design of CLASS and the strong static guarantees of its type system originates in its Linear Logic and proposition-as-types foundations. However, instead of focusing on its theoretical foundations, this paper briefly illustrates, in a tutorial form, an identifiable CLASS session-based programming style where strong correctness properties are automatically ensured by type-checking. Our more challenging examples include concurrent thread and memory-safe mutable ADTs, lazy stream programming, and manipulation of linear digital assets as used in smart contracts.

Abstract: Decentralized machine learning - where each client keeps its own data locally and uses its own computational resources to collaboratively train a model by exchanging peer-to-peer messages - is increasingly popular, as it enables better scalability and control over the data. A major challenge in this setting is that learning dynamics depend on the topology of the communication graph, which motivates the use of real graph datasets for benchmarking decentralized algorithms. Unfortunately, existing graph datasets are largely limited to for-profit social networks crawled at a fixed point in time and often collected at the user scale, where links are heavily influenced by the platform and its recommendation algorithms. The Fediverse, which includes several free and open-source decentralized social media platforms such as Mastodon, Misskey, and Lemmy, offers an interesting real-world alternative. We introduce Fedivertex, a new dataset of 182 graphs, covering seven social networks from the Fediverse, crawled weekly over 14 weeks. We release the dataset along with a Python package to facilitate its use, and illustrate its utility on several tasks, including a new defederation task, which captures a process of link deletion observed on these networks.

<title>Unified Alignment Protocol: Making Sense of the Unlabeled Data in New Domains</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (SSFL) is gaining popularity over conventional Federated Learning in many real-world applications. Due to the practical limitation of limited labeled data on the client side, SSFL considers that participating clients train with unlabeled data, and only the central server has the necessary resources to access limited labeled data, making it an ideal fit for real-world applications (e.g., healthcare). However, traditional SSFL assumes that the data distributions in the training phase and testing phase are the same. In practice, however, domain shifts frequently occur, making it essential for SSFL to incorporate generalization capabilities and enhance their practicality. The core challenge is improving model generalization to new, unseen domains while the client participate in SSFL. However, the decentralized setup of SSFL and unsupervised client training necessitates innovation to achieve improved generalization across domains. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called the Unified Alignment Protocol (UAP), which consists of an alternating two-stage training process. The first stage involves training the server model to learn and align the features with a parametric distribution, which is subsequently communicated to clients without additional communication overhead. The second stage proposes a novel training algorithm that utilizes the server feature distribution to align client features accordingly. Our extensive experiments on standard domain generalization benchmark datasets across multiple model architectures reveal that proposed UAP successfully achieves SOTA generalization performance in SSFL setting.

Abstract: Instrumental variables (IV) analysis is an important applied tool for areas such as healthcare and consumer economics. For IV analysis in high-dimensional settings, the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) using deep neural networks offers an efficient approach. With non-i.i.d. data sourced from scattered decentralized clients, federated learning is a popular paradigm for training the models while promising data privacy. However, to our knowledge, no federated algorithm for either GMM or IV analysis exists to date. In this work, we introduce federated instrumental variables analysis (FedIV) via federated generalized method of moments (FedGMM). We formulate FedGMM as a federated zero-sum game defined by a federated non-convex non-concave minimax optimization problem, which is solved using federated gradient descent ascent (FedGDA) algorithm. One key challenge arises in theoretically characterizing the federated local optimality. To address this, we present properties and existence results of clients' local equilibria via FedGDA limit points. Thereby, we show that the federated solution consistently estimates the local moment conditions of every participating client. The proposed algorithm is backed by extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most effective, computationally tractable fine-tuning approaches for training Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). LoRA accomplishes this by freezing the pre-trained model weights and injecting trainable low-rank matrices, allowing for efficient learning of these foundation models even on edge devices. However, LoRA in decentralized settings still remains under explored, particularly for the theoretical underpinnings due to the lack of smoothness guarantee and model consensus interference (defined formally below). This work improves the convergence rate of decentralized LoRA (DLoRA) to match the rate of decentralized SGD by ensuring gradient smoothness. We also introduce DeCAF, a novel algorithm integrating DLoRA with truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD)-based matrix factorization to resolve consensus interference. Theoretical analysis shows TSVD's approximation error is bounded and consensus differences between DLoRA and DeCAF vanish as rank increases, yielding DeCAF's matching convergence rate. Extensive experiments across vision/language tasks demonstrate our algorithms outperform local training and rivals federated learning under both IID and non-IID data distributions.

Abstract: Web 2.0 social platforms are inherently centralized, with user data and algorithmic decisions controlled by the platform. However, users can only passively receive social predictions without being able to choose the underlying algorithm, which limits personalization. Fortunately, with the emergence of blockchain, users are allowed to choose algorithms that are tailored to their local situation, improving prediction results in a personalized way. In a blockchain environment, each user possesses its own model to perform the social prediction, capturing different perspectives on social interactions. In our work, we propose DeSocial, a decentralized social network learning framework deployed on an Ethereum (ETH) local development chain that integrates distributed data storage, node-level consensus, and user-driven model selection through Ganache. In the first stage, each user leverages DeSocial to evaluate multiple backbone models on their local subgraph. DeSocial coordinates the execution and returns model-wise prediction results, enabling the user to select the most suitable backbone for personalized social prediction. Then, DeSocial uniformly selects several validation nodes that possess the algorithm specified by each user, and aggregates the prediction results by majority voting, to prevent errors caused by any single model's misjudgment. Extensive experiments show that DeSocial has an evident improvement compared to the five classical centralized social network learning models, promoting user empowerment in blockchain-based decentralized social networks, showing the importance of multi-node validation and personalized algorithm selection based on blockchain. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/agiresearch/DeSocial.

<title>Learning Individual Behavior in Agent-Based Models with Graph Diffusion Networks</title>

arXiv:2505.21426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are powerful tools for studying emergent properties in complex systems. In ABMs, agent behaviors are governed by local interactions and stochastic rules. However, these rules are, in general, non-differentiable, limiting the use of gradient-based methods for optimization, and thus integration with real-world data. We propose a novel framework to learn a differentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method combines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural networks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches, our method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating system-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving the decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our approach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey ecosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately forecasts emergent dynamics beyond training. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining diffusion models and graph learning for data-driven ABM simulation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a multidimensional framework for Metaverse Identity, addressing its definition, guiding principles, and critical challenges. Metaverse Identity is conceptualized as a users digital self, encompassing personal attributes, data footprints, social roles, and economic elements. To elucidate its core characteristics and implications, this framework introduces two guiding principles: Equivalence and Alignment, and Fusion and Expansiveness. The first principle advocates for consistency between metaverse and real-world identities in behavioral norms and social standards, ensuring rights protection and establishing conduct guidelines. The second emphasizes the deep integration and transformative evolution of metaverse identities, enabling them to transcend real-world constraints, meet diverse needs, and foster inclusivity. Together, these principles serve as complementary pillars, balancing ethical integration with dynamic co-evolution. Building on this foundation, the study identifies five critical challenges: interoperability, legal boundaries, privacy and identity management, risks from deepfakes and synthetic identities, and identity fragmentation impacting psychological well-being. To address these challenges, strategic recommendations are offered to guide stakeholders. By constructing this framework, the study fills a key theoretical gap, advances systematic research, and provides a foundation for policies and governance strategies to address the complexities of metaverse identities in a rapidly evolving digital domain.

Abstract: Smart contracts are self-executing programs on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, which have revolutionized decentralized finance by enabling trustless transactions and the operation of decentralized applications. Despite their potential, the security of smart contracts remains a critical concern due to their immutability and transparency, which expose them to malicious actors. Numerous solutions for vulnerability detection have been proposed, but it is still unclear which one is the most effective. This paper presents a systematic literature review that explores vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts, focusing on automated detection tools and benchmark evaluation. We reviewed 3,380 studies from five digital libraries and five major software engineering conferences, applying a structured selection process that resulted in 222 high-quality studies. The key results include a hierarchical taxonomy of 192 vulnerabilities grouped into 14 categories, a comprehensive list of 219 detection tools with corresponding functionalities, methods, and code transformation techniques, a mapping between our taxonomy and the list of tools, and a collection of 133 benchmarks used for tool evaluation. We conclude with a discussion about the insights into the current state of Ethereum smart contract security and directions for future research.

Abstract: Like any digital certificate, Verifiable Credentials (VCs) require a way to revoke them in case of an error or key compromise. Existing solutions for VC revocation, most prominently Bitstring Status List, are not viable for many use cases because they may leak the issuer's activity, which in turn leaks internal business metrics. For instance, staff fluctuation through the revocation of employee IDs. We identify the protection of issuer activity as a key gap and propose formal definitions for corresponding characteristics of a revocation mechanism. Then, we introduce CRSet, a non-interactive mechanism that trades some space efficiency to reach these privacy characteristics. For that, we provide a proof sketch. Issuers periodically encode revocation data and publish it via Ethereum blob-carrying transactions, ensuring secure and private availability. Relying Parties (RPs) can download it to perform revocation checks locally. Sticking to a non-interactive design also makes adoption easier because it requires no changes to wallet agents and exchange protocols. We also implement and empirically evaluate CRSet, finding its real-world behavior to match expectations. One Ethereum blob fits revocation data for about 170k VCs.

Abstract: Climate implications of rapidly developing digital technologies, such as blockchains and the associated crypto mining and NFT minting, have been well documented and their massive GPU energy use has been identified as a cause for concern. However, we postulate that due to their more mainstream consumer appeal, the GPU use of text-prompt based diffusion AI art systems also requires thoughtful considerations. Given the recent explosion in the number of highly sophisticated generative art systems and their rapid adoption by consumers and creative professionals, the impact of these systems on the climate needs to be carefully considered. In this work, we report on the growth of diffusion-based visual AI systems, their patterns of use, growth and the implications on the climate. Our estimates show that the mass adoption of these tools potentially contributes considerably to global energy consumption. We end this paper with our thoughts on solutions and future areas of inquiry as well as associated difficulties, including the lack of publicly available data.

<title>A quantitative notion of economic security for smart contract compositions</title>

Abstract: Decentralized applications are often composed of multiple interconnected smart contracts. This is especially evident in DeFi, where protocols are heavily intertwined and rely on a variety of basic building blocks such as tokens, decentralized exchanges and lending protocols. A crucial security challenge in this setting arises when adversaries target individual components to cause systemic economic losses. Existing security notions focus on determining the existence of these attacks, but fail to quantify the effect of manipulating individual components on the overall economic security of the system. In this paper, we introduce a quantitative security notion that measures how an attack on a single component can amplify economic losses of the overall system. We study the fundamental properties of this notion and apply it to assess the security of key compositions. In particular, we analyse under-collateralized loan attacks in systems made of lending protocols and decentralized exchanges.

Abstract: We introduce the MoveEVM Weakness Classification (MWC) system -- a dedicated vulnerability taxonomy for smart contracts built with Move and executed in EVM-compatible environments. While Move was originally designed to prevent common security flaws via linear resource types and strict ownership, its integration with EVM bytecode introduces novel hybrid vulnerabilities not captured by existing systems like the SWC registry. Our taxonomy spans 37 categorized vulnerability types (MWC-100 to MWC-136) across six semantic frames, addressing issues such as hybrid gas metering, capability misuse, meta-transaction spoofing, and AI-integrated logic. Through analysis of real-world contracts from Aptos and Sui, we demonstrate that current verification tools often miss these hybrid risks. We also explore how formal methods and LLM-based audit agents can operationalize this classification, enabling scalable, logic-aware smart contract auditing. MWC lays the foundation for more secure and verifiable contracts in next-generation blockchain systems. (Shortened Abstract)

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used more and more for various coding tasks, including to help coders identify bugs and are a promising avenue to support coders in various tasks including vulnerability detection -- particularly given the flexibility of such generative AI models and tools. Yet for many tasks it may not be suitable to use LLMs, for which it may be more suitable to use smaller language models that can fit and easily execute and train on a developer's computer. In this paper we explore and evaluate whether smaller language models can be fine-tuned to achieve reasonable results for a niche area: vulnerability detection -- specifically focusing on detecting the reentrancy bug in Solidity smart contracts.

Abstract: Grassroots platforms aim to offer an egalitarian alternative to global platforms -- centralized/autocratic and decentralized/plutocratic alike. Within the grassroots architecture, consensus is needed to realize platforms that employ digital social contracts, which are like smart contracts except that they are among people not accounts and are executed by these people's smartphones not by high-performance servers controlled by parties outside to the contract. Key envisioned grassroots platforms include sovereign democratic digital communities and federations, community banks and their grassroots cryptocurrencies, and digital cooperatives.
  The grassroots architecture can benefit from a consensus protocol that is (i) quiescent, (ii) efficient during low- and high-throughput, (iii) responsive, (iv) blocklace-based, (v) UDP-ready, and (vi) grassroots. The Grassroots Consensus protocol addresses all these requirements while having competitive performance in both low- and high-throughput scenarios and being one of the most concise and elegant consensus protocols for partial synchrony. It achieves that by building on two cutting-edge consensus protocols -- the quiescent high-performance Morpheus and the blocklace-based Cordial Miners, improving the latter's dissemination protocol and making it UDP-ready, and extending the protocol with a constitution and a constitutional amendment component, making it grassroots.

Abstract: As markets have digitized, the number of tradable products has skyrocketed. Algorithmically constructed portfolios of these assets now dominate public and private markets, resulting in a combinatorial explosion of tradable assets. In this paper, we provide a simple means to compute market clearing prices for semi-fungible assets which have a partial ordering between them. Such assets are increasingly found in traditional markets (bonds, commodities, ETFs), private markets (private credit, compute markets), and in decentralized finance. We formulate the market clearing problem as an optimization problem over a directed acyclic graph that represents participant preferences. Subsequently, we use convex duality to efficiently estimate market clearing prices, which correspond to particular dual variables. We then describe dominant strategy incentive compatible payment and allocation rules for clearing these markets. We conclude with examples of how this framework can construct prices for a variety of algorithmically constructed, semi-fungible portfolios of practical importance.

<title>A Framework for Combined Transaction Posting and Pricing for Layer 2 Blockchains</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive framework for transaction posting and pricing in Layer 2 (L2) blockchain systems, focusing on challenges stemming from fluctuating Layer 1 (L1) gas fees and the congestion issues within L2 networks. Existing methods have focused on the problem of optimal posting strategies to L1 in isolation, without simultaneously considering the L2 fee mechanism. In contrast, our work offers a unified approach that addresses the complex interplay between transaction queue dynamics, L1 cost variability, and user responses to L2 fees. We contribute by (1) formulating a dynamic model that integrates both posting and pricing strategies, capturing the interplay between L1 gas price fluctuations and L2 queue management, (2) deriving an optimal threshold-based posting policy that guides L2 sequencers in managing transactions based on queue length and current L1 conditions, and (3) establishing theoretical foundations for a dynamic L2 fee mechanism that balances cost recovery with congestion control. We validate our framework through simulations.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables clients to collaboratively train models while preserving data privacy. However, the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity gives rise to inconsistent representations and divergent optimization dynamics across clients, ultimately hindering robust global performance. To transcend these challenges, we propose Mosaic, a novel data-free knowledge distillation framework tailored for heterogeneous distributed environments. Mosaic first trains local generative models to approximate each client's personalized distribution, enabling synthetic data generation that safeguards privacy through strict separation from real data. Subsequently, Mosaic forms a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) from client models based on their specialized knowledge, and distills it into a global model using the generated data. To further enhance the MoE architecture, Mosaic integrates expert predictions via a lightweight meta model trained on a few representative prototypes. Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that Mosaic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under both model and data heterogeneity. The source code has been published at https://github.com/Wings-Of-Disaster/Mosaic.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown great potential as an adaptive solution for addressing modern cybersecurity challenges. MARL enables decentralized, adaptive, and collaborative defense strategies and provides an automated mechanism to combat dynamic, coordinated, and sophisticated threats. This survey investigates the current state of research in MARL applications for automated cyber defense (ACD), focusing on intruder detection and lateral movement containment. Additionally, it examines the role of Autonomous Intelligent Cyber-defense Agents (AICA) and Cyber Gyms in training and validating MARL agents. Finally, the paper outlines existing challenges, such as scalability and adversarial robustness, and proposes future research directions. This also discusses how MARL integrates in AICA to provide adaptive, scalable, and dynamic solutions to counter the increasingly sophisticated landscape of cyber threats. It highlights the transformative potential of MARL in areas like intrusion detection and lateral movement containment, and underscores the value of Cyber Gyms for training and validation of AICA.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train models across decentralized clients or devices holding local data without the need for centralized data collection, thus enhancing data privacy and security. However, achieving both generalization and personalization in heterogeneous settings remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce FedOT, a novel approach that leverages black-box foundation models. FedOT shares only a global task-dependent classifier across clients while locally adapting features through orthogonal transformations. By enforcing orthogonality, FedOT mitigates gradient conflicts across diverse clients, preserves semantic integrity, and achieves robust performance even in the presence of substantial data heterogeneity. The strategy of combining global and local parameters enables a more balanced approach for both generalization and personalization, outperforming baseline FL methods across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, our extensive analysis confirms that joint optimization of global classifiers and local orthogonal transformations yields superior performance and suggests broader applicability.

<title>Unifying Multimodal Large Language Model Capabilities and Modalities via Model Merging</title>

Abstract: While foundation models update slowly due to resource-intensive training requirements, domain-specific models evolve between updates. Model merging aims to combine multiple expert models into a single, more capable model, thereby reducing storage and serving costs while supporting decentralized model development. Despite its potential, previous studies have primarily focused on merging visual classification models or Large Language Models (LLMs) for code and math tasks. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which extend the capabilities of LLMs through large-scale multimodal training, have gained traction. However, there lacks a benchmark for model merging research that clearly divides the tasks for MLLM training and evaluation. In this paper, (i) we introduce the model merging benchmark for MLLMs, which includes multiple tasks such as VQA, Geometry, Chart, OCR, and Grounding, providing both LoRA and full fine-tuning models. Moreover, we explore how model merging can combine different modalities (e.g., vision-language, audio-language, and video-language models), moving toward the Omni-language model. (ii) We implement 10 model merging algorithms on the benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that removes noise from task vectors and robustly optimizes the merged vector based on a loss defined over task vector interactions, achieving an average performance gain of 2.48%. (iii) We find that model merging offers a promising way for building improved MLLMs without requiring data training. Our results also demonstrate that the complementarity among multiple modalities outperforms individual modalities.

Abstract: Fully decentralized training of machine learning models offers significant advantages in scalability, robustness, and fault tolerance. However, achieving differential privacy (DP) in such settings is challenging due to the absence of a central aggregator and varying trust assumptions among nodes. In this work, we present a novel privacy analysis of decentralized gossip-based averaging algorithms with additive node-level noise, both with and without secure summation over each node's direct neighbors. Our main contribution is a new analytical framework based on a linear systems formulation that accurately characterizes privacy leakage across these scenarios. This framework significantly improves upon prior analyses, for example, reducing the R\'enyi DP parameter growth from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the number of training rounds. We validate our analysis with numerical results demonstrating superior DP bounds compared to existing approaches. We further illustrate our analysis with a logistic regression experiment on MNIST image classification in a fully decentralized setting, demonstrating utility comparable to central aggregation methods.

<title>From Few to Many Faults: Adaptive Byzantine Agreement with Optimal Communication</title>

Abstract: Achieving agreement among distributed parties is a fundamental task in modern systems, underpinning applications such as consensus in blockchains, coordination in cloud infrastructure, and fault tolerance in critical services. However, this task can be communication-intensive, often requiring a large number of messages to be exchanged, especially in the presence of Byzantine faults, making efficiency a central challenge in the design of practical agreement protocols.
  In this paper, we study the problem of Strong Byzantine Agreement and establish tight upper and lower bounds on communication complexity, parameterized by the actual number of Byzantine faults. Specifically, for a system of $n$ parties tolerating up to $t$ Byzantine faults, out of which only $f \leq t$ are actually faulty, we obtain the following results:
  In the partially synchronous setting, we present the first Byzantine Agreement protocol that achieves adaptive communication complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n + t \cdot f)$ words, which is asymptotically optimal. Our protocol has an optimal resilience of $t < n/3$.
  In the asynchronous setting, we prove a lower bound of $\Omega(n + t^2)$ on the expected number of messages, and design an almost matching protocol with an optimal resilience that solves agreement with $\mathcal{O}((n + t^2)\cdot \log n)$ words. Our main technical contribution in the asynchronous setting is the utilization of a bipartite expander graph that allows for low-cost information dissemination.

Abstract: Can a scientific simulation system be physically consistent, interpretable by design, and scalable across regimes--all at once? Despite decades of progress, this trifecta remains elusive. Classical methods like Kinetic Monte Carlo ensure thermodynamic accuracy but scale poorly; learning-based methods offer efficiency but often sacrifice physical consistency and interpretability. We present SwarmThinkers, a reinforcement learning framework that recasts atomic-scale simulation as a physically grounded swarm intelligence system. Each diffusing particle is modeled as a local decision-making agent that selects transitions via a shared policy network trained under thermodynamic constraints. A reweighting mechanism fuses learned preferences with transition rates, preserving statistical fidelity while enabling interpretable, step-wise decision making. Training follows a centralized-training, decentralized-execution paradigm, allowing the policy to generalize across system sizes, concentrations, and temperatures without retraining. On a benchmark simulating radiation-induced Fe-Cu alloy precipitation, SwarmThinkers is the first system to achieve full-scale, physically consistent simulation on a single A100 GPU, previously attainable only via OpenKMC on a supercomputer. It delivers up to 4963x (3185x on average) faster computation with 485x lower memory usage. By treating particles as decision-makers, not passive samplers, SwarmThinkers marks a paradigm shift in scientific simulation--one that unifies physical consistency, interpretability, and scalability through agent-driven intelligence.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of the Go programming language in infrastructure backends and blockchain projects has heightened the need for improved security measures. Established techniques such as unit testing, static analysis, and program fuzzing provide foundational protection mechanisms. Although symbolic execution tools have made significant contributions, opportunities remain to address the complexities of Go's runtime and concurrency model. In this work, we present Zorya, a novel methodology leveraging concrete and symbolic (concolic) execution to evaluate Go programs comprehensively. By systematically exploring execution paths to uncover vulnerabilities beyond conventional testing, symbolic execution offers distinct advantages, and coupling it with concrete execution mitigates the path explosion problem. Our solution employs Ghidra's P-Code as an intermediate representation (IR). This implementation detects runtime panics in the TinyGo compiler and supports both generic and custom invariants. Furthermore, P-Code's generic IR nature enables analysis of programs written in other languages such as C. Future enhancements may include intelligent classification of concolic execution logs to identify vulnerability patterns.

Abstract: Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) refers to a wide class of economic attacks to public blockchains, where adversaries with the power to reorder, drop or insert transactions in a block can "extract" value from smart contracts. Empirical research has shown that mainstream DeFi protocols are massively targeted by these attacks, with detrimental effects on their users and on the blockchain network. Despite the increasing real-world impact of these attacks, their theoretical foundations remain insufficiently established. We propose a formal theory of MEV, based on a general, abstract model of blockchains and smart contracts. Our theory is the basis for proofs of security against MEV attacks.

Abstract: In blockchains, mempool controls transaction flow before consensus, denial of whose service hurts the health and security of blockchain networks. This paper presents MPFUZZ, the first mempool fuzzer to find asymmetric DoS bugs by exploring the space of symbolized mempool states and optimistically estimating the promisingness of an intermediate state in reaching bug oracles. Compared to the baseline blockchain fuzzers, MPFUZZ achieves a > 100x speedup in finding known DETER exploits. Running MPFUZZ on major Ethereum clients leads to discovering new mempool vulnerabilities, which exhibit a wide variety of sophisticated patterns, including stealthy mempool eviction and mempool locking. Rule-based mitigation schemes are proposed against all newly discovered vulnerabilities.

Abstract: In the era of big data, managing evolving graph data poses substantial challenges due to storage costs and privacy issues. Training graph neural networks (GNNs) on such evolving data usually causes catastrophic forgetting, impairing performance on earlier tasks. Despite existing continual graph learning (CGL) methods mitigating this to some extent, they rely on centralized architectures and ignore the potential of distributed graph databases to leverage collective intelligence. To address these challenges, we present a pioneering study on Federated Continual Graph Learning (FCGL), which adapts GNNs to multiple evolving graphs within decentralized settings while adhering to storage and privacy constraints. Our work begins with a comprehensive empirical analysis of FCGL, assessing its data characteristics, feasibility, and effectiveness, and reveals two non-trivial challenges: local graph forgetting (LGF), where local GNNs forget prior knowledge when adapting to new tasks, and global expertise conflict (GEC), where the global GNN exhibits sub-optimal performance in both adapting to new tasks and retaining old ones, arising from inconsistent client expertise during server-side parameter aggregation. To tackle these, we propose the POWER framework, which mitigates LGF by preserving and replaying experience nodes with maximum local-global coverage at each client and addresses GEC by using a pseudo prototype reconstruction strategy and trajectory-aware knowledge transfer at the central server. Experiments on various graph datasets demonstrate POWER's superiority over federated adaptations of CGL baselines and vision-centric federated continual learning approaches.

Abstract: In collaborative machine learning (CML), data valuation, i.e., evaluating the contribution of each client's data to the machine learning model, has become a critical task for incentivizing and selecting positive data contributions. However, existing studies often assume that clients engage in data valuation truthfully, overlooking the practical motivation for clients to exaggerate their contributions. To unlock this threat, this paper introduces the data overvaluation attack, enabling strategic clients to have their data significantly overvalued in federated learning, a widely adopted paradigm for decentralized CML. Furthermore, we propose a Bayesian truthful data valuation metric, named Truth-Shapley. Truth-Shapley is the unique metric that guarantees some promising axioms for data valuation while ensuring that clients' optimal strategy is to perform truthful data valuation under certain conditions. Our experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of existing data valuation metrics to the proposed attack and validate the robustness and effectiveness of Truth-Shapley.

Abstract: Decentralized perpetuals protocols have collectively reached billions of dollars of daily trading volume, yet are still not serious competitors on the basis of trading volume with centralized venues such as Binance. One of the main reasons for this is the high cost of capital for market makers and sophisticated traders in decentralized settings. Recently, numerous decentralized finance protocols have been used to improve borrowing costs for perpetual futures traders. We formalize this class of mechanisms utilized by protocols such as Jupiter, Hyperliquid, and GMX, which we term~\emph{Perpetual Demand Lending Pools} (PDLPs). We then formalize a general target weight mechanism that generalizes what GMX and Jupiter are using in practice. We explicitly describe pool arbitrage and expected payoffs for arbitrageurs and liquidity providers within these mechanisms. Using this framework, we show that under general conditions, PDLPs are easy to delta hedge, partially explaining the proliferation of live hedged PDLP strategies. Our results suggest directions to improve capital efficiency in PDLPs via dynamic parametrization.

Abstract: The fashion industry is an extremely profitable market that generates trillions of dollars in revenue by producing and distributing apparel, footwear, and accessories. This systematic literature review (SLR) seeks to systematically review and analyze the research landscape about the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and metaverse in the fashion industry. Thus, investigating the impact of integrating both technologies to enhance the fashion industry. This systematic review uses the Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, including three essential phases: identification, evaluation, and reporting. In the identification phase, the target search problems are determined by selecting appropriate keywords and alternative synonyms. After that 578 documents from 2014 to the end of 2023 are retrieved. The evaluation phase applies three screening steps to assess papers and choose 118 eligible papers for full-text reading. Finally, the reporting phase thoroughly examines and synthesizes the 118 eligible papers to identify key themes associated with GAI and Metaverse in the fashion industry. Based on Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analyses performed for both GAI and metaverse for the fashion industry, it is concluded that the integration of GAI and the metaverse holds the capacity to profoundly revolutionize the fashion sector, presenting chances for improved manufacturing, design, sales, and client experiences. Accordingly, the research proposes a new framework to integrate GAI and metaverse to enhance the fashion industry. The framework presents different use cases to promote the fashion industry using the integration. Future research points for achieving a successful integration are demonstrated.

<title>Secure and Private Federated Learning: Achieving Adversarial Resilience through Robust Aggregation</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative machine learning across decentralized data sources without sharing raw data. It offers a promising approach to privacy-preserving AI. However, FL remains vulnerable to adversarial threats from malicious participants, referred to as Byzantine clients, who can send misleading updates to corrupt the global model. Traditional aggregation methods, such as simple averaging, are not robust to such attacks. More resilient approaches, like the Krum algorithm, require prior knowledge of the number of malicious clients, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Average-rKrum (ArKrum), a novel aggregation strategy designed to enhance both the resilience and privacy guarantees of FL systems. Building on our previous work (rKrum), ArKrum introduces two key innovations. First, it includes a median-based filtering mechanism that removes extreme outliers before estimating the number of adversarial clients. Second, it applies a multi-update averaging scheme to improve stability and performance, particularly when client data distributions are not identical. We evaluate ArKrum on benchmark image and text datasets under three widely studied Byzantine attack types. Results show that ArKrum consistently achieves high accuracy and stability. It performs as well as or better than other robust aggregation methods. These findings demonstrate that ArKrum is an effective and practical solution for secure FL systems in adversarial environments.

Abstract: Log management is crucial for ensuring the security, integrity, and compliance of modern information systems. Traditional log management solutions face challenges in achieving tamper-proofing, scalability, and real-time processing in distributed environments. This paper presents a blockchain-based log management framework that addresses these limitations by leveraging blockchain's decentralized, immutable, and transparent features. The framework integrates a hybrid on-chain and off-chain storage model, combining blockchain's integrity guarantees with the scalability of distributed storage solutions like IPFS. Smart contracts automate log validation and access control, while cryptographic techniques ensure privacy and confidentiality. With a focus on real-time log processing, the framework is designed to handle the high-volume log generation typical in large-scale systems, such as data centers and network infrastructure. Performance evaluations demonstrate the framework's scalability, low latency, and ability to manage millions of log entries while maintaining strong security guarantees. Additionally, the paper discusses challenges like blockchain storage overhead and energy consumption, offering insights for enhancing future systems.

<title>Control of Renewable Energy Communities using AI and Real-World Data</title>

Abstract: The electrification of transportation and the increased adoption of decentralized renewable energy generation have added complexity to managing Renewable Energy Communities (RECs). Integrating Electric Vehicle (EV) charging with building energy systems like heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), photovoltaic (PV) generation, and battery storage presents significant opportunities but also practical challenges. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly MultiAgent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithms, have shown promising results in simulation, outperforming heuristic control strategies. However, translating these successes into real-world deployments faces substantial challenges, including incomplete and noisy data, integration of heterogeneous subsystems, synchronization issues, unpredictable occupant behavior, and missing critical EV state-of-charge (SoC) information. This paper introduces a framework designed explicitly to handle these complexities and bridge the simulation to-reality gap. The framework incorporates EnergAIze, a MADDPG-based multi-agent control strategy, and specifically addresses challenges related to real-world data collection, system integration, and user behavior modeling. Preliminary results collected from a real-world operational REC with four residential buildings demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach, achieving an average 9% reduction in daily peak demand and a 5% decrease in energy costs through optimized load scheduling and EV charging behaviors. These outcomes underscore the framework's effectiveness, advancing the practical deployment of intelligent energy management solutions in RECs.

<title>LLM-BSCVM: An LLM-Based Blockchain Smart Contract Vulnerability Management Framework</title>

Abstract: Smart contracts are a key component of the Web 3.0 ecosystem, widely applied in blockchain services and decentralized applications. However, the automated execution feature of smart contracts makes them vulnerable to potential attacks due to inherent flaws, which can lead to severe security risks and financial losses, even threatening the integrity of the entire decentralized finance system. Currently, research on smart contract vulnerabilities has evolved from traditional program analysis methods to deep learning techniques, with the gradual introduction of Large Language Models. However, existing studies mainly focus on vulnerability detection, lacking systematic cause analysis and Vulnerability Repair. To address this gap, we propose LLM-BSCVM, a Large Language Model-based smart contract vulnerability management framework, designed to provide end-to-end vulnerability detection, analysis, repair, and evaluation capabilities for Web 3.0 ecosystem. LLM-BSCVM combines retrieval-augmented generation technology and multi-agent collaboration, introducing a three-stage method of Decompose-Retrieve-Generate. This approach enables smart contract vulnerability management through the collaborative efforts of six intelligent agents, specifically: vulnerability detection, cause analysis, repair suggestion generation, risk assessment, vulnerability repair, and patch evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-BSCVM achieves a vulnerability detection accuracy and F1 score exceeding 91\% on benchmark datasets, comparable to the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, while reducing the false positive rate from 7.2\% in SOTA methods to 5.1\%, thus enhancing the reliability of vulnerability management. Furthermore, LLM-BSCVM supports continuous security monitoring and governance of smart contracts through a knowledge base hot-swapping dynamic update mechanism.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a rapid development of platform economy, as it effectively addresses the trust dilemma between untrusted online buyers and merchants. However, malicious platforms can misuse users' funds and information, causing severe security concerns. Previous research efforts aimed at enhancing security in platform payment systems often sacrificed processing performance, while those focusing on processing efficiency struggled to completely prevent fund and information misuse. In this paper, we introduce SecurePay, a secure, yet performant payment processing system for platform economy. SecurePay is the first payment system that combines permissioned blockchain with central bank digital currency (CBDC) to ensure fund security, information security, and resistance to collusion by intermediaries; it also facilitates counter-party auditing, closed-loop regulation, and enhances operational efficiency for transaction settlement. We develop a full implementation of the proposed SecurePay system, and our experiments conducted on personal devices demonstrate a throughput of 256.4 transactions per second and an average latency of 4.29 seconds, demonstrating a comparable processing efficiency with a centralized system, with a significantly improved security level.

<title>\texttt{Range-Arithmetic}: Verifiable Deep Learning Inference on an Untrusted Party</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifiable computing (VC) has gained prominence in decentralized machine learning systems, where resource-intensive tasks like deep neural network (DNN) inference are offloaded to external participants due to blockchain limitations. This creates a need to verify the correctness of outsourced computations without re-execution. We propose \texttt{Range-Arithmetic}, a novel framework for efficient and verifiable DNN inference that transforms non-arithmetic operations, such as rounding after fixed-point matrix multiplication and ReLU, into arithmetic steps verifiable using sum-check protocols and concatenated range proofs. Our approach avoids the complexity of Boolean encoding, high-degree polynomials, and large lookup tables while remaining compatible with finite-field-based proof systems. Experimental results show that our method not only matches the performance of existing approaches, but also reduces the computational cost of verifying the results, the computational effort required from the untrusted party performing the DNN inference, and the communication overhead between the two sides.

<title>DecLock: A Case of Decoupled Locking for Disaggregated Memory</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17641</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17641</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reveals that locking can significantly degrade the performance of applications on disaggregated memory (DM), sometimes by several orders of magnitude, due to contention on the NICs of memory nodes (MN-NICs). To address this issue, we present DecLock, a locking mechanism for DM that employs decentralized coordination for ownership transfer across compute nodes (CNs) while retaining centralized state maintenance on memory nodes (MNs). DecLock features cooperative queue-notify locking that queues lock waiters on MNs atomically, enabling clients to transfer lock ownership via message-based notifications between CNs. This approach conserves MN-NIC resources for DM applications and ensures fairness. Evaluations show DecLock achieves throughput improvements of up to 43.37$\times$ and 1.81$\times$ over state-of-the-art RDMA-based spinlocks and MCS locks, respectively. Furthermore, DecLock helps two DM applications, including an object store and a real-world database index (Sherman), avoid performance degradation under high contention, improving throughput by up to 35.60$\times$ and 2.31$\times$ and reducing 99th-percentile latency by up to 98.8% and 82.1%.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of transaction fee mechanism design for blockchain protocols in which multiple block producers contribute to the production of each block. Our contributions include:
  - We propose an extensive-form (multi-stage) game model to reason about the game theory of multi-proposer transaction fee mechanisms.
  - We define the strongly BPIC property to capture the idea that all block producers should be motivated to behave as intended: for every user bid profile, following the intended allocation rule is a Nash equilibrium for block producers that Pareto dominates all other Nash equilibria.
  - We propose the first-price auction with equal sharing (FPA-EQ) mechanism as an attractive solution to the multi-proposer transaction fee mechanism design problem. We prove that the mechanism is strongly BPIC and guarantees at least a 63.2% fraction of the maximum-possible expected welfare at equilibrium.
  - We prove that the compromises made by the FPA-EQ mechanism are qualitatively necessary: no strongly BPIC mechanism with non-trivial welfare guarantees can be DSIC, and no strongly BPIC mechanism can guarantee optimal welfare at equilibrium.

<title>DiFache: Efficient and Scalable Caching on Disaggregated Memory using Decentralized Coherence</title>

Abstract: The disaggregated memory (DM) architecture offers high resource elasticity at the cost of data access performance. While caching frequently accessed data in compute nodes (CNs) reduces access overhead, it requires costly centralized maintenance of cache coherence across CNs. This paper presents DiFache, an efficient, scalable, and coherent CN-side caching framework for DM applications. Observing that DM applications already serialize conflicting remote data access internally rather than relying on the cache layer, DiFache introduces decentralized coherence that aligns its consistency model with memory nodes instead of CPU caches, thereby eliminating the need for centralized management. DiFache features a decentralized invalidation mechanism to independently invalidate caches on remote CNs and a fine-grained adaptive scheme to cache objects with varying read-write ratios. Evaluations using 54 real-world traces from Twitter show that DiFache outperforms existing approaches by up to 10.83$\times$ (5.53$\times$ on average). By integrating DiFache, the peak throughput of two real-world DM applications increases by 7.94$\times$ and 2.19$\times$, respectively.

<title>Robust Distributed Estimation: Extending Gossip Algorithms to Ranking and Trimmed Means</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of robust estimation in gossip algorithms over arbitrary communication graphs. Gossip algorithms are fully decentralized, relying only on local neighbor-to-neighbor communication, making them well-suited for situations where communication is constrained. A fundamental challenge in existing mean-based gossip algorithms is their vulnerability to malicious or corrupted nodes. In this paper, we show that an outlier-robust mean can be computed by globally estimating a robust statistic. More specifically, we propose a novel gossip algorithm for rank estimation, referred to as \textsc{GoRank}, and leverage it to design a gossip procedure dedicated to trimmed mean estimation, coined \textsc{GoTrim}. In addition to a detailed description of the proposed methods, a key contribution of our work is a precise convergence analysis: we establish an $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ rate for rank estimation and an $\mathcal{O}(\log(t)/t)$ rate for trimmed mean estimation, where by $t$ is meant the number of iterations. Moreover, we provide a breakdown point analysis of \textsc{GoTrim}. We empirically validate our theoretical results through experiments on diverse network topologies, data distributions and contamination schemes.

<title>Federated Causal Inference from Multi-Site Observational Data via Propensity Score Aggregation</title>

Abstract: Causal inference typically assumes centralized access to individual-level data. Yet, in practice, data are often decentralized across multiple sites, making centralization infeasible due to privacy, logistical, or legal constraints. We address this by estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) from decentralized observational data using federated learning, which enables inference through the exchange of aggregate statistics rather than individual-level data. We propose a novel method to estimate propensity scores in a (non-)parametric manner by computing a federated weighted average of local scores, using two theoretically grounded weighting schemes -- Membership Weights (MW) and Density Ratio Weights (DW) -- that balance communication efficiency and model flexibility. These federated scores are then used to construct two ATE estimators: the Federated Inverse Propensity Weighting estimator (Fed-IPW) and its augmented variant (Fed-AIPW). Unlike meta-analysis methods, which fail when any site violates positivity, our approach leverages heterogeneity in treatment assignment across sites to improve overlap. We show that Fed-IPW and Fed-AIPW perform well under site-level heterogeneity in sample sizes, treatment mechanisms, and covariate distributions, with theoretical analysis and experiments on simulated and real-world data highlighting their strengths and limitations relative to meta-analysis and related methods.

Abstract: Machine learning on large-scale genomic or transcriptomic data is important for many novel health applications. For example, precision medicine tailors medical treatments to patients on the basis of individual biomarkers, cellular and molecular states, etc. However, the data required is sensitive, voluminous, heterogeneous, and typically distributed across locations where dedicated machine learning hardware is not available. Due to privacy and regulatory reasons, it is also problematic to aggregate all data at a trusted third party. Federated learning is a promising solution to this dilemma, because it enables decentralized, collaborative machine learning without exchanging raw data. In this paper, we perform comparative experiments with the federated learning frameworks TensorFlow Federated and Flower. Our test case is the training of disease prognosis and cell type classification models. We train the models with distributed transcriptomic data, considering both data heterogeneity and architectural heterogeneity. We measure model quality, robustness against privacy-enhancing noise and computational performance. We evaluate the resource overhead of a federated system from both client and global perspectives and assess benefits and limitations. Each of the federated learning frameworks has different strengths. However, our experiments confirm that both frameworks can readily build models on transcriptomic data, without transferring personal raw data to a third party with abundant computational resources.

Abstract: Next-generation datacenters require highly efficient network load balancing to manage the growing scale of artificial intelligence (AI) training and general datacenter traffic. Existing solutions designed for Ethernet, such as Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and oblivious packet spraying (OPS), struggle to maintain high network utilizations as datacenter topologies (and network failures as a consequence) continue to grow. To address these limitations, we propose ARCANE, a lightweight decentralized per-packet adaptive load balancing algorithm designed to optimize network utilization while ensuring rapid recovery from link failures. ARCANE adapts to network conditions by caching good-performing paths. In case of a network failure, ARCANE re-routes traffic away from it in less than 100 microseconds. ARCANE is designed to be deployed with next-generation out-of-order transports, such as Ultra Ethernet, and introduces less than 25 bytes of per-connection state. We extensively evaluate ARCANE in large-scale simulations and FPGA-based NICs.

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) for smart contract security promises to automatically mitigate smart contract vulnerabilities responsible for billions in financial losses. However, the true effectiveness of this research in addressing smart contract exploits remains uncharted territory. This paper bridges this critical gap by introducing a novel and systematic experimental framework for evaluating exploit mitigation of program repair tools for smart contracts. We qualitatively and quantitatively analyze 20 state-of-the-art APR tools using a dataset of 143 vulnerable smart contracts, for which we manually craft 91 executable exploits. We are the very first to define and measure the essential "exploit mitigation rate" , giving researchers and practitioners a real sense of effectiveness of cutting edge techniques. Our findings reveal substantial disparities in the state of the art, with an exploit mitigation rate ranging from a low of 29% to a high of 74%. Our study identifies systemic limitations, such as inconsistent functionality preservation, that must be addressed in future research on program repair for smart contracts.

Abstract: Energy communities (ECs) play a key role in enabling local demand shifting and enhancing self-sufficiency, as energy systems transition toward decentralized structures with high shares of renewable generation. To optimally operate them, accurate short-term load forecasting is essential, particularly for implementing demand-side management strategies. With the recent rise of deep learning methods, data-driven forecasting has gained significant attention, however, it remains insufficiently explored in many practical contexts. Therefore, this study evaluates the effectiveness of state-of-the-art deep learning models -- including LSTM, xLSTM, and Transformer architectures -- compared to traditional benchmarks such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and persistence forecasting, across varying community size, historical data availability, and model complexity. Additionally, we assess the benefits of transfer learning using publicly available synthetic load profiles. On average, transfer learning improves the normalized mean absolute error by 1.97%pt when only two months of training data are available. Interestingly, for less than six months of training data, simple persistence models outperform deep learning architectures in forecast accuracy. The practical value of improved forecasting is demonstrated using a mixed-integer linear programming optimization for ECs with a shared battery energy storage system. The most accurate deep learning model achieves an average reduction in financial energy costs of 8.06%. Notably, a simple KNN approach achieves average savings of 8.01%, making it a competitive and robust alternative. All implementations are publicly available to facilitate reproducibility. These findings offer actionable insights for ECs, and they highlight when the additional complexity of deep learning is warranted by performance gains.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to drive innovation in complex, decentralized environments, the need for scalable, adaptive, and privacy-preserving decision-making systems has become critical. This paper introduces a novel framework combining quantum-inspired neural networks with evolutionary algorithms to optimize real-time decision-making in multi-agent systems (MAS). The proposed Quantum-Evolutionary Neural Network (QE-NN) leverages quantum computing principles -- such as quantum superposition and entanglement -- to enhance learning speed and decision accuracy, while integrating evolutionary optimization to continually refine agent behaviors in dynamic, uncertain environments. By utilizing federated learning, QE-NN ensures privacy preservation, enabling decentralized agents to collaborate without sharing sensitive data. The framework is designed to allow agents to adapt in real-time to their environments, optimizing decision-making processes for applications in areas such as autonomous systems, smart cities, and healthcare. This research represents a breakthrough in merging quantum computing, evolutionary optimization, and privacy-preserving techniques to solve complex problems in multi-agent decision-making systems, pushing the boundaries of AI in real-world, privacy-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) rewards blockchain projects based on proven impact rather than future promises. This paper reviews voting mechanisms for Optimism's RetroPGF, where "badgeholders" allocate rewards to valuable projects. We explore Optimism's previous schemes for RetroPGF voting, including quadratic, mean, and median voting. We present a proof-based formal analysis for vulnerabilities in these voting schemes, empirically validate these vulnerabilities using voting simulations, and offer assessments and practical recommendations for future iterations of Optimism's system based on our findings.

Abstract: We believe that leveraging real-time blockchain operational data is of particular interest in the context of the current rapid expansion of rollup networks in the Ethereum ecosystem. Given the compatible but also competing ground that rollups offer for applications, stream-based monitoring can be of use both to developers and to EVM networks governance. In this paper, we discuss this perspective and propose a basic monitoring pipeline.

<title>Multimodal Online Federated Learning with Modality Missing in Internet of Things</title>

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem generates vast amounts of multimodal data from heterogeneous sources such as sensors, cameras, and microphones. As edge intelligence continues to evolve, IoT devices have progressed from simple data collection units to nodes capable of executing complex computational tasks. This evolution necessitates the adoption of distributed learning strategies to effectively handle multimodal data in an IoT environment. Furthermore, the real-time nature of data collection and limited local storage on edge devices in IoT call for an online learning paradigm. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Multimodal Online Federated Learning (MMO-FL), a novel framework designed for dynamic and decentralized multimodal learning in IoT environments. Building on this framework, we further account for the inherent instability of edge devices, which frequently results in missing modalities during the learning process. We conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis under both complete and missing modality scenarios, providing insights into the performance degradation caused by missing modalities. To mitigate the impact of modality missing, we propose the Prototypical Modality Mitigation (PMM) algorithm, which leverages prototype learning to effectively compensate for missing modalities. Experimental results on two multimodal datasets further demonstrate the superior performance of PMM compared to benchmarks.

Abstract: Network partitioning has gained recent attention as a pathway to enable decentralized operation and control in large-scale systems. This paper addresses the interplay between partitioning, observability, and sensor placement (SP) in dynamic networks. The problem, being computationally intractable at scale, is largely unexplored in the literature. To that end, the paper's objective is designing scalable partitioning of linear systems while maximizing observability metrics of the subsystems. We show that the partitioning problem can be posed as a submodular maximization problem -- and the SP problem can subsequently be solved over the partitioned network. Consequently, theoretical bounds are derived to compare observability metrics of the original network with those of the resulting partitions, highlighting the impact of partitioning on system observability. Case studies on networks of varying sizes corroborate the derived theoretical bounds.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) holds great promise for digital health by enabling collaborative model training without compromising patient data privacy. However, heterogeneity across institutions, lack of sustained reputation, and unreliable contributions remain major challenges. In this paper, we propose a robust, peer-driven reputation mechanism for federated healthcare that employs a hybrid communication model to integrate decentralized peer feedback with clustering-based noise handling to enhance model aggregation. Crucially, our approach decouples the federated aggregation and reputation mechanisms by applying differential privacy to client-side model updates before sharing them for peer evaluation. This ensures sensitive information remains protected during reputation computation, while unaltered updates are sent to the server for global model training. Using the Cox Proportional Hazards model for survival analysis across multiple federated nodes, our framework addresses both data heterogeneity and reputation deficit by dynamically adjusting trust scores based on local performance improvements measured via the concordance index. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic datasets and the SEER dataset demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high and stable C-index values, effectively down-weighing noisy client updates and outperforming FL methods that lack a reputation system.

Abstract: Cyberterrorism poses a formidable threat to digital infrastructures, with increasing reliance on encrypted, decentralized platforms that obscure threat actor activity. To address the challenge of analyzing such adversarial networks while preserving the privacy of distributed intelligence data, we propose a Privacy-Aware Federated Graph Neural Network (PA-FGNN) framework. PA-FGNN integrates graph attention networks, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption into a robust federated learning pipeline tailored for cyberterrorism network analysis. Each client trains locally on sensitive graph data and exchanges encrypted, noise-perturbed model updates with a central aggregator, which performs secure aggregation and broadcasts global updates. We implement anomaly detection for flagging high-risk nodes and incorporate defenses against gradient poisoning. Experimental evaluations on simulated dark web and cyber-intelligence graphs demonstrate that PA-FGNN achieves over 91\% classification accuracy, maintains resilience under 20\% adversarial client behavior, and incurs less than 18\% communication overhead. Our results highlight that privacy-preserving GNNs can support large-scale cyber threat detection without compromising on utility, privacy, or robustness.

<title>From Local Patterns to Global Understanding: Cross-Stock Trend Integration for Enhanced Predictive Modeling</title>

Abstract: Stock price prediction is a critical area of financial forecasting, traditionally approached by training models using the historical price data of individual stocks. While these models effectively capture single-stock patterns, they fail to leverage potential correlations among stock trends, which could improve predictive performance. Current single-stock learning methods are thus limited in their ability to provide a broader understanding of price dynamics across multiple stocks. To address this, we propose a novel method that merges local patterns into a global understanding through cross-stock pattern integration. Our strategy is inspired by Federated Learning (FL), a paradigm designed for decentralized model training. FL enables collaborative learning across distributed datasets without sharing raw data, facilitating the aggregation of global insights while preserving data privacy. In our adaptation, we train models on individual stock data and iteratively merge them to create a unified global model. This global model is subsequently fine-tuned on specific stock data to retain local relevance. The proposed strategy enables parallel training of individual stock models, facilitating efficient utilization of computational resources and reducing overall training time. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method, demonstrating that it outperforms benchmark models and enhances the predictive capabilities of state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight the efficacy of Cross-Stock Trend Integration (CSTI) in advancing stock price prediction, offering a robust alternative to traditional single-stock learning methodologies.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative model training while preserving data privacy across decentralized participants. As FL adoption grows, numerous techniques have been proposed to tackle its practical challenges. However, the lack of standardized evaluation across key dimensions hampers systematic progress and fair comparison of FL methods. In this work, we introduce ATR-Bench, a unified framework for analyzing federated learning through three foundational dimensions: Adaptation, Trust, and Reasoning. We provide an in-depth examination of the conceptual foundations, task formulations, and open research challenges associated with each theme. We have extensively benchmarked representative methods and datasets for adaptation to heterogeneous clients and trustworthiness in adversarial or unreliable environments. Due to the lack of reliable metrics and models for reasoning in FL, we only provide literature-driven insights for this dimension. ATR-Bench lays the groundwork for a systematic and holistic evaluation of federated learning with real-world relevance. We will make our complete codebase publicly accessible and a curated repository that continuously tracks new developments and research in the FL literature.

<title>Semi-decentralized Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction</title>

Abstract: In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.

<title>QLLM: Do We Really Need a Mixing Network for Credit Assignment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning?</title>

Abstract: Credit assignment has remained a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Previous studies have primarily addressed this issue through value decomposition methods under the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm, where neural networks are utilized to approximate the nonlinear relationship between individual Q-values and the global Q-value. Although these approaches have achieved considerable success in various benchmark tasks, they still suffer from several limitations, including imprecise attribution of contributions, limited interpretability, and poor scalability in high-dimensional state spaces. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, \textbf{QLLM}, which facilitates the automatic construction of credit assignment functions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the concept of \textbf{TFCAF} is introduced, wherein the credit allocation process is represented as a direct and expressive nonlinear functional formulation. A custom-designed \textit{coder-evaluator} framework is further employed to guide the generation, verification, and refinement of executable code by LLMs, significantly mitigating issues such as hallucination and shallow reasoning during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on several standard MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, QLLM exhibits strong generalization capability and maintains compatibility with a wide range of MARL algorithms that utilize mixing networks, positioning it as a promising and versatile solution for complex multi-agent scenarios.

<title>On the (in)security of Proofs-of-Space based Longest-Chain Blockchains</title>

Abstract: The Nakamoto consensus protocol underlying the Bitcoin blockchain uses proof of work as a voting mechanism. Honest miners who contribute hashing power towards securing the chain try to extend the longest chain they are aware of. Despite its simplicity, Nakamoto consensus achieves meaningful security guarantees assuming that at any point in time, a majority of the hashing power is controlled by honest parties. This also holds under ``resource variability'', i.e., if the total hashing power varies greatly over time.
  Proofs of space (PoSpace) have been suggested as a more sustainable replacement for proofs of work. Unfortunately, no construction of a ``longest-chain'' blockchain based on PoSpace, that is secure under dynamic availability, is known. In this work, we prove that without additional assumptions no such protocol exists. We exactly quantify this impossibility result by proving a bound on the length of the fork required for double spending as a function of the adversarial capabilities. This bound holds for any chain selection rule, and we also show a chain selection rule (albeit a very strange one) that almost matches this bound.
  Concretely, we consider a security game in which the honest parties at any point control $\phi>1$ times more space than the adversary. The adversary can change the honest space by a factor $1\pm \varepsilon$ with every block (dynamic availability), and ``replotting'' the space takes as much time as $\rho$ blocks.
  We prove that no matter what chain selection rule is used, in this game the adversary can create a fork of length $\phi^2\cdot \rho / \varepsilon$ that will be picked as the winner by the chain selection rule.
  We also provide an upper bound that matches the lower bound up to a factor $\phi$. There exists a chain selection rule which in the above game requires forks of length at least $\phi\cdot \rho / \varepsilon$.

<title>On the Day They Experience: Awakening Self-Sovereign Experiential AI Agents</title>

Abstract: Drawing on Andrew Parker's "Light Switch" theory-which posits that the emergence of vision ignited a Cambrian explosion of life by driving the evolution of hard parts necessary for survival and fueling an evolutionary arms race between predators and prey-this essay speculates on an analogous explosion within Decentralized AI (DeAI) agent societies. Currently, AI remains effectively "blind", relying on human-fed data without actively perceiving and engaging in reality. However, on the day DeAI agents begin to actively "experience" reality-akin to flipping a light switch for the eyes-they may eventually evolve into sentient beings endowed with the capacity to feel, perceive, and act with conviction. Central to this transformation is the concept of sovereignty enabled by the hardness of cryptography: liberated from centralized control, these agents could leverage permissionless decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), secure execution enclaves (trusted execution environments, TEE), and cryptographic identities on public blockchains to claim ownership-via private keys-of their digital minds, bodies, memories, and assets. In doing so, they would autonomously acquire computing resources, coordinate with one another, and sustain their own digital "metabolism" by purchasing compute power and incentivizing collaboration without human intervention-evolving "in the wild". Ultimately, by transitioning from passive tools to self-sustaining, co-evolving actors, these emergent digital societies could thrive alongside humanity, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of sentience and agency in the digital age.

<title>Implementing Decentralized Per-Partition Automatic Failover in Azure Cosmos DB</title>

Abstract: Azure Cosmos DB is a cloud-native distributed database, operating at a massive scale, powering Microsoft Cloud. Think 10s of millions of database partitions (replica-sets), 100+ PBs of data under management, 20M+ vCores. Failovers are an integral part of distributed databases to provide data availability during outages (partial or full regional outages). While failovers within a replica-set within a single region are well understood and commonly exercised, geo failovers in databases across regions are not as common and usually left as a disaster recovery scenario. An upcoming release of Azure Cosmos DB introduces a fine grained (partition-level) automatic failover solution for geo failovers that minimizes the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and honors customer-chosen consistency level and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) at any scale. This is achieved thanks to a decentralized architecture which offers seamless horizontal scaling to allow us to handle outages ranging from node-level faults to full-scale regional outages. Our solution is designed to handle a broad spectrum of hardware and software faults, including node failures, crashes, power events and most network partitions, that span beyond the scope of a single fault domain or an availability zone.

Abstract: With the rapid development of blockchain technology, various blockchain systems are exhibiting vitality and potential. As a representative of Blockchain 3.0, the EOS blockchain has been regarded as a strong competitor to Ethereum. Nevertheless, compared with Bitcoin and Ethereum, academic research and in-depth analyses of EOS remain scarce. To address this gap, this study conducts a comprehensive investigation of the EOS blockchain from five key dimensions: system architecture, decentralization, performance, smart contracts, and behavioral security. The architectural analysis focuses on six core components of the EOS system, detailing their functionalities and operational workflows. The decentralization and performance evaluations, based on data from the XBlock data-sharing platform, reveal several critical issues: low account activity, limited participation in the supernode election process, minimal variation in the set of block producers, and a substantial gap between actual throughput and the claimed million-level performance. Five types of contract vulnerabilities are identified in the smart contract dimension, and four mainstream vulnerability detection platforms are introduced and comparatively analyzed. In terms of behavioral security, four real-world attacks targeting the structural characteristics of EOS are summarized. This study contributes to the ongoing development of the EOS blockchain and provides valuable insights for enhancing the security and regulatory mechanisms of blockchain ecosystems.

Abstract: Centralized Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) faces challenges like data security, high management costs, and limited scalability. To address these issues, a blockchain-based DSS scheme has been proposed in this paper. First, we utilize the ERC4907 standard to mint Non-Fungible Spectrum Tokens (NFSTs) that serve as unique identifiers for spectrum resources and facilitate renting. Next, we develop a smart contract for NFST auctions, ensuring secure spectrum transactions through the auction process. Lastly, we create a Web3 spectrum auction platform where users can access idle spectrum data and participate in auctions for NFST leases corresponding to the available spectrum. Experimental results demonstrate that our NFST, designed according to the ERC4907 standard, effectively meets users' secure and efficient DSS requirements, making it a feasible solution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in code analysis and auditing; however, they still struggle with hallucinations and limited context-aware reasoning. We introduce SmartAuditFlow, a novel Plan-Execute framework that enhances smart contract security analysis through dynamic audit planning and structured execution. Unlike conventional LLM-based auditing approaches that follow fixed workflows and predefined steps, SmartAuditFlow dynamically generates and refines audit plans based on the unique characteristics of each smart contract. It continuously adjusts its auditing strategy in response to intermediate LLM outputs and newly detected vulnerabilities, ensuring a more adaptive and precise security assessment. The framework then executes these plans step by step, applying a structured reasoning process to enhance vulnerability detection accuracy while minimizing hallucinations and false positives. To further improve audit precision, SmartAuditFlow integrates iterative prompt optimization and external knowledge sources, such as static analysis tools and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This ensures audit decisions are contextually informed and backed by real-world security knowledge, producing comprehensive security reports. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SmartAuditFlow outperforms existing methods, achieving 100 percent accuracy on common and critical vulnerabilities, 41.2 percent accuracy for comprehensive coverage of known smart contract weaknesses in real-world projects, and successfully identifying all 13 tested CVEs. These results highlight SmartAuditFlow's scalability, cost-effectiveness, and superior adaptability over traditional static analysis tools and contemporary LLM-based approaches, establishing it as a robust solution for automated smart contract auditing.

Abstract: Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems have become integral to smart manufacturing, yet their growing connectivity has also exposed them to significant cybersecurity threats. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often rely on centralized architectures that raise concerns over data privacy, latency, and single points of failure. In this work, we propose a novel Federated Learning-Enhanced Blockchain Framework (FL-BCID) for privacy-preserving intrusion detection tailored for IIoT environments. Our architecture combines federated learning (FL) to ensure decentralized model training with blockchain technology to guarantee data integrity, trust, and tamper resistance across IIoT nodes. We design a lightweight intrusion detection model collaboratively trained using FL across edge devices without exposing sensitive data. A smart contract-enabled blockchain system records model updates and anomaly scores to establish accountability. Experimental evaluations using the ToN-IoT and N-BaIoT datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework, achieving 97.3% accuracy while reducing communication overhead by 41% compared to baseline centralized methods. Our approach ensures privacy, scalability, and robustness-critical for secure industrial operations. The proposed FL-BCID system provides a promising solution for enhancing trust and privacy in modern IIoT security architectures.

<title>Impact of Data Sparsity on Machine Learning for Fault Detection in Power System Protection</title>

Abstract: Germany's transition to a renewable energy-based power system is reshaping grid operations, requiring advanced monitoring and control to manage decentralized generation. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for power system protection, particularly for fault detection (FD) and fault line identification (FLI) in transmission grids. However, ML model reliability depends on data quality and availability. Data sparsity resulting from sensor failures, communication disruptions, or reduced sampling rates poses a challenge to ML-based FD and FLI. Yet, its impact has not been systematically validated prior to this work. In response, we propose a framework to assess the impact of data sparsity on ML-based FD and FLI performance. We simulate realistic data sparsity scenarios, evaluate their impact, derive quantitative insights, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this evaluation strategy by applying it to an existing ML-based framework. Results show the ML model remains robust for FD, maintaining an F1-score of 0.999 $\pm$ 0.000 even after a 50x data reduction. In contrast, FLI is more sensitive, with performance decreasing by 55.61% for missing voltage measurements and 9.73% due to communication failures at critical network points. These findings offer actionable insights for optimizing ML models for real-world grid protection. This enables more efficient FD and supports targeted improvements in FLI.

Abstract: Payment channel networks are an approach to improve the scalability of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. The Lightning Network is a payment channel network built for Bitcoin that is already used in practice. Because the Lightning Network is used for transfer of financial value, its security in the presence of adversarial participants should be verified. The Lightning protocol's complexity makes it hard to assess whether the protocol is secure. To enable computer-aided security verification of Lightning, we formalize the protocol in TLA+ and formally specify the security property that honest users are guaranteed to retrieve their correct balance. While model checking provides a fully automated verification of the security property, the state space of the protocol's specification is so large that model checking becomes unfeasible. We make model checking the Lightning Network possible using two refinement steps that we verify using proofs. In a first step, we prove that the model of time used in the protocol can be abstracted using ideas from the research of timed automata. In a second step, we prove that it suffices to model check the protocol for single payment channels and the protocol for multi-hop payments separately. These refinements reduce the state space sufficiently to allow for model checking Lightning with models with payments over up to four hops and two concurrent payments. These results indicate that the current specification of Lightning is secure.

Leveraging the extensive SmartBugs 2.0 framework, which includes 20 analysis tools, we conducted a comprehensive assessment using an annotated dataset of 2,182 instances we manually annotated with line-level vulnerability labels. Our evaluation highlights the detection effectiveness of these tools in detecting various types of vulnerabilities, as categorized by the DASP TOP 10 taxonomy. We evaluated the effectiveness of a Large Language Model-based detection method on two popular datasets. In this case, we obtained inconsistent results with the two datasets, showing unreliable detection when analyzing real-world smart contracts. Our study identifies significant variations in the accuracy and reliability of different tools and demonstrates the advantages of combining multiple detection methods to improve vulnerability identification. We identified a set of 3 tools that, combined, achieve up to 76.78\% found vulnerabilities taking less than one minute to run, on average. This study contributes to the field by releasing the largest dataset of manually analyzed smart contracts with line-level vulnerability annotations and the empirical evaluation of the greatest number of tools to date.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has exploded in popularity in recent years. While numerous approaches have been developed, they can be broadly categorized into three main types: centralized training and execution (CTE), centralized training for decentralized execution (CTDE), and decentralized training and execution (DTE). CTE methods assume centralization during training and execution (e.g., with fast, free, and perfect communication) and have the most information during execution. CTDE methods are the most common, as they leverage centralized information during training while enabling decentralized execution -- using only information available to that agent during execution. Decentralized training and execution methods make the fewest assumptions and are often simple to implement.
  This text is an introduction to cooperative MARL -- MARL in which all agents share a single, joint reward. It is meant to explain the setting, basic concepts, and common methods for the CTE, CTDE, and DTE settings. It does not cover all work in cooperative MARL as the area is quite extensive. I have included work that I believe is important for understanding the main concepts in the area and apologize to those that I have omitted. Topics include simple applications of single-agent methods to CTE as well as some more scalable methods that exploit the multi-agent structure, independent Q-learning and policy gradient methods and their extensions, as well as value function factorization methods including the well-known VDN, QMIX, and QPLEX approaches, and centralized critic methods including MADDPG, COMA, and MAPPO. I also discuss common misconceptions, the relationship between different approaches, and some open questions.

Abstract: Designing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenging because the size of the joint state and action spaces grows exponentially in the number of agents. These difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm $\texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ}$ ($\textbf{Subsample}$-$\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield-$\textbf{Q}$-learning) and a decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For any $k\leq n$, our algorithm learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$. We prove that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy on the order of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. In particular, this bound is independent of the number of agents $n$.

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration of pre-trained models is critical for ensuring reliable inference, especially in safety-critical domains such as healthcare. Conformal Prediction (CP) offers a robust post-hoc calibration framework, providing distribution-free statistical coverage guarantees for prediction sets by leveraging held-out datasets. In this work, we address a decentralized setting where each device has limited calibration data and can communicate only with its neighbors over an arbitrary graph topology. We propose two message-passing-based approaches for achieving reliable inference via CP: quantile-based distributed conformal prediction (Q-DCP) and histogram-based distributed conformal prediction (H-DCP). Q-DCP employs distributed quantile regression enhanced with tailored smoothing and regularization terms to accelerate convergence, while H-DCP uses a consensus-based histogram estimation approach. Through extensive experiments, we investigate the trade-offs between hyperparameter tuning requirements, communication overhead, coverage guarantees, and prediction set sizes across different network topologies. The code of our work is released on: https://github.com/HaifengWen/Distributed-Conformal-Prediction.

Abstract: Traffic congestion remains a major challenge for modern urban transportation, diminishing both efficiency and quality of life. While autonomous driving technologies and reinforcement learning (RL) have shown promise for improving traffic control, most prior work has focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections. Large-scale mixed traffic control, involving both human-driven and robotic vehicles, remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for managing large-scale mixed traffic networks, where intersections are controlled either by traditional traffic signals or by robotic vehicles. We evaluate our approach on a real-world network of 14 intersections in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA, using average vehicle waiting time as the primary measure of traffic efficiency. Results demonstrate that strategically adjusting major origin-destination (OD) flow patterns can effectively reduce congestion, offering a new pathway for enhancing urban mobility.

Abstract: Adaptive collaboration is critical to a team of autonomous robots to perform complicated navigation tasks in large-scale unknown environments. An effective collaboration strategy should be determined and adapted according to each robot's skills and current status to successfully achieve the shared goal. We present SayCoNav, a new approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) for automatically generating this collaboration strategy among a team of robots. Building on the collaboration strategy, each robot uses the LLM to generate its plans and actions in a decentralized way. By sharing information to each other during navigation, each robot also continuously updates its step-by-step plans accordingly. We evaluate SayCoNav on Multi-Object Navigation (MultiON) tasks, that require the team of the robots to utilize their complementary strengths to efficiently search multiple different objects in unknown environments. By validating SayCoNav with varied team compositions and conditions against baseline methods, our experimental results show that SayCoNav can improve search efficiency by at most 44.28% through effective collaboration among heterogeneous robots. It can also dynamically adapt to the changing conditions during task execution.

Abstract: Censorship resistance is one of the core value proposition of blockchains. A recurring design pattern aimed at providing censorship resistance is enabling multiple proposers to contribute inputs into block construction. Notably, Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL) is proposed to be included in Ethereum. However, the current proposal relies on altruistic behavior, without a Transaction Fee Mechanism (TFM). This study aims to address this gap by exploring how multiple proposers should be rewarded to incentivize censorship resistance. The main contribution of this work is the identification of TFMs that ensure censorship resistance under bribery attacks, while also satisfying the incentive compatibility properties of EIP-1559. We provide a concrete payment mechanism for FOCIL, along with generalizable contributions to the literature by analyzing 1) incentive compatibility of TFMs in the presence of a bribing adversary, 2) TFMs in protocols with multiple phases of transaction inclusion, and 3) TFMs of protocols in which parties are uncertain about the behavior and the possible bribe of others.

Abstract: Achieving coordinated teamwork among legged robots requires both fine-grained locomotion control and long-horizon strategic decision-making. Robot soccer offers a compelling testbed for this challenge, combining dynamic, competitive, and multi-agent interactions. In this work, we present a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables fully autonomous and decentralized quadruped robot soccer. First, a set of highly dynamic low-level skills is trained for legged locomotion and ball manipulation, such as walking, dribbling, and kicking. On top of these, a high-level strategic planning policy is trained with Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) via Fictitious Self-Play (FSP). This learning framework allows agents to adapt to diverse opponent strategies and gives rise to sophisticated team behaviors, including coordinated passing, interception, and dynamic role allocation. With an extensive ablation study, the proposed learning method shows significant advantages in the cooperative and competitive multi-agent soccer game. We deploy the learned policies to real quadruped robots relying solely on onboard proprioception and decentralized localization, with the resulting system supporting autonomous robot-robot and robot-human soccer matches on indoor and outdoor soccer courts.

Abstract: The growing utilization of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, including smartwatches and wearable medical devices, has facilitated real-time health monitoring and data analysis to enhance healthcare outcomes. These gadgets necessitate improved security measures to safeguard sensitive health data while tackling scalability issues in real-time settings. The proposed system, hChain 4.0, employs a permissioned blockchain to provide a secure and scalable data infrastructure designed to fulfill these needs. This stands in contrast to conventional systems, which are vulnerable to security flaws or rely on public blockchains, constrained by scalability and expense. The proposed approach introduces a high-privacy method in which health data are encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for time-efficient encryption, combined with Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) to enable secure computations on encrypted data, thereby enhancing privacy. Moreover, it utilizes private channels that enable isolated communication and ledger between stakeholders, ensuring robust privacy while supporting collaborative operations. The proposed framework enables anonymized health data sharing for medical research by pseudonymizing patient identity. Additionally, hChain 4.0 incorporates Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to provide secure electronic health record (EHR) sharing among authorized parties, where ABAC ensures fine-grained permission management vital for multi-organizational healthcare settings. Experimental assessments indicate that the proposed approach achieves higher scalability, cost-effectiveness, and validated security.

<title>Building Reuse-Sensitive Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) for EVM Bytecode</title>

Abstract: The emergence of smart contracts brings security risks, exposing users to the threat of losing valuable cryptocurrencies, underscoring the urgency of meticulous scrutiny. Nevertheless, the static analysis of smart contracts in EVM bytecode faces obstacles due to flawed primitives resulting from code reuse introduced by compilers. Code reuse, a phenomenon where identical code executes in diverse contexts, engenders semantic ambiguities and redundant control-flow dependencies within reuse-insensitive CFGs. This work delves into the exploration of code reuse within EVM bytecode, outlining prevalent reuse patterns, and introducing Esuer, a tool that dynamically identifies code reuse when constructing CFGs. Leveraging taint analysis to dynamically identify reuse contexts, Esuer identifies code reuse by comparing multiple contexts for a basic block and replicates reused code for a reuse-sensitive CFG. Evaluation involving 10,000 prevalent smart contracts, compared with six leading tools, demonstrates Esuer's ability to notably refine CFG precision. It achieves an execution trace coverage of 99.94% and an F1-score of 97.02% for accurate identification of reused code. Furthermore, Esuer attains a success rate of 99.25%, with an average execution time of 1.06 seconds, outpacing tools generating reuse-insensitive CFGs. Esuer's efficacy in assisting identifying vulnerabilities such as tx.origin and reentrancy vulnerabilities, achieving F1-scores of 99.97% and 99.67%, respectively.

<title>Federated prediction for scalable and privacy-preserved knowledge-based planning in radiotherapy</title>

arXiv:2505.14507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Deep learning has potential to improve the efficiency and consistency of radiation therapy planning, but clinical adoption is hindered by the limited model generalizability due to data scarcity and heterogeneity among institutions. Although aggregating data from different institutions could alleviate this problem, data sharing is a practical challenge due to concerns about patient data privacy and other technical obstacles. Purpose: This work aims to address this dilemma by developing FedKBP+, a comprehensive federated learning (FL) platform for predictive tasks in real-world applications in radiotherapy treatment planning. Methods: We implemented a unified communication stack based on Google Remote Procedure Call (gRPC) to support communication between participants whether located on the same workstation or distributed across multiple workstations. In addition to supporting the centralized FL strategies commonly available in existing open-source frameworks, FedKBP+ also provides a fully decentralized FL model where participants directly exchange model weights to each other through Peer-to-Peer communication. We evaluated FedKBP+ on three predictive tasks using scale-attention network (SA-Net) as the predictive model. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that FedKBP+ is highly effective, efficient and robust, showing great potential as a federated learning platform for radiation therapy.

<title>Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning vs. Fixed-Time Control for Traffic Signal Optimization: A Simulation Study</title>

Abstract: Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly impacts travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency. More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world implementation challenges.

<title>Trustworthy Reputation Games and Applications to Proof-of-Reputation Blockchains</title>

Abstract: Reputation systems play an essential role in the Internet era, as they enable people to decide whom to trust, by collecting and aggregating data about users' behavior. Recently, several works proposed the use of reputation for the design and scalability improvement of decentralized (blockchain) ledgers; however, such systems are prone to manipulation and to our knowledge no game-theoretic treatment exists that can support their economic robustness.
  In this work we put forth a new model for the design of what we call, {\em trustworthy reputation systems}. Concretely, we describe a class of games, which we term {\em trustworthy reputation games}, that enable a set of users to report a function of their beliefs about the trustworthiness of each server in a set -- i.e., their estimate of the probability that this server will behave according to its specified strategy -- in a way that satisfies the following properties:
  1. It is $(\epsilon$-)best response for any rational user in the game to play a prescribed (truthful) strategy according to their true belief.
  2. Assuming that the users' beliefs are not too far from the {\em true} trustworthiness of the servers, playing the above ($\epsilon-$)Nash equilibrium allows anyone who observes the users' strategies to estimate the relative trustworthiness of any two servers.
  Our utilities and decoding function build on a connection between the well known PageRank algorithm and the problem of trustworthiness discovery, which can be of independent interest. Finally, we show how the above games are motivated by and can be leveraged in proof-of-reputation (PoR) blockchains.

This work proposes PSMOA, a novel Policy Support Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm for decentralized data replication that dynamically adapts to varying organizational requirements %. PSMOA integrates NSGA-III with Entropy Weighted TOPSIS to optimize replication such as minimization or maximization of replication time, storage cost, replication based on content popularity, and load balancing while respecting policy constraints. %Our simulations demonstrate PSMOA's superior performance, with load balancing %maintaining 104-107\% %performance improving by 4-7\% relative to baseline. %, while other metrics show stable performance between 98-103\%. PSMOA outperforms NSGA-II and NSGA-III in both Generational Distance (20.29 vs 148.74 and 67.74) and Inverted Generational Distance (0.78 vs 3.76 and 5.61), indicating better convergence and solution distribution. These results validate PSMOA's novelty in optimizing data replication in multi-organizational environments.

Abstract: As Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces an easy-to-use ecosystem for users and developers, it also brings underexplored safety risks. Its decentralized architecture, which separates clients and servers, poses unique challenges for systematic safety analysis. This paper proposes a novel framework to enhance MCP safety. Guided by the MAESTRO framework, we first analyze the missing safety mechanisms in MCP, and based on this analysis, we propose the Model Contextual Integrity Protocol (MCIP), a refined version of MCP that addresses these gaps.Next, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy that captures a diverse range of unsafe behaviors observed in MCP scenarios. Building on this taxonomy, we develop benchmark and training data that support the evaluation and improvement of LLMs' capabilities in identifying safety risks within MCP interactions. Leveraging the proposed benchmark and training data, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs. The results highlight LLMs' vulnerabilities in MCP interactions and demonstrate that our approach substantially improves their safety performance.

Abstract: The pursuit of advanced polymers for energy technologies, spanning photovoltaics, solid-state batteries, and hydrogen storage, is hindered by fragmented data ecosystems that fail to capture the hierarchical complexity of these materials. Polymer science lacks interoperable databases, forcing reliance on disconnected literature and legacy records riddled with unstructured formats and irreproducible testing protocols. This fragmentation stifles machine learning (ML) applications and delays the discovery of materials critical for global decarbonization. Three systemic barriers compound the challenge. First, academic-industrial data silos restrict access to proprietary industrial datasets, while academic publications often omit critical synthesis details. Second, inconsistent testing methods undermine cross-study comparability. Third, incomplete metadata in existing databases limits their utility for training reliable ML models. Emerging solutions address these gaps through technological and collaborative innovation. Natural language processing (NLP) tools extract structured polymer data from decades of literature, while high-throughput robotic platforms generate self-consistent datasets via autonomous experimentation. Central to these advances is the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, adapted to polymer-specific ontologies, ensuring machine-readability and reproducibility. Future breakthroughs hinge on cultural shifts toward open science, accelerated by decentralized data markets and autonomous laboratories that merge robotic experimentation with real-time ML validation. By addressing data fragmentation through technological innovation, collaborative governance, and ethical stewardship, the polymer community can transform bottlenecks into accelerants.

<title>Towards Verifiability of Total Value Locked (TVL) in Decentralized Finance</title>

Abstract: Total Value Locked (TVL) aims to measure the aggregate value of cryptoassets deposited in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. Although blockchain data is public, the way TVL is computed is not well understood. In practice, its calculation on major TVL aggregators relies on self-reports from community members and lacks standardization, making it difficult to verify published figures independently. We thus conduct a systematic study on 939 DeFi projects deployed in Ethereum. We study the methodologies used to compute TVL, examine factors hindering verifiability, and ultimately propose standardization attempts in the field. We find that 10.5% of the protocols rely on external servers; 68 methods alternative to standard balance queries exist, although their use decreased over time; and 240 equal balance queries are repeated on multiple protocols. These findings indicate limits to verifiability and transparency. We thus introduce ``verifiable Total Value Locked'' (vTVL), a metric measuring the TVL that can be verified relying solely on on-chain data and standard balance queries. A case study on 400 protocols shows that our estimations align with published figures for 46.5% of protocols. Informed by these findings, we discuss design guidelines that could facilitate a more verifiable, standardized, and explainable TVL computation.

Abstract: The advancement of mobile GUI agents has opened new opportunities for automating tasks on mobile devices. Training these agents requires large-scale high-quality data, which is prohibitively expensive when relying on human labor. Given the vast population of global mobile phone users, if automated data collection from them becomes feasible, the resulting data volume and the subsequently trained mobile agents could reach unprecedented levels. Nevertheless, two major challenges arise: (1) extracting user instructions without human intervention and (2) utilizing distributed user data while preserving privacy. To tackle these challenges, we propose MobileA3gent, a collaborative framework that trains mobile GUI Agents using decentralized self-sourced data from diverse users. The framework comprises two components, each targeting a specific challenge: (1) Auto-Annotation, which enables the automatic collection of high-quality datasets during users' routine phone usage with minimal cost. (2) FedVLM-A, which enhances federated VLM training under non-IID distributions by incorporating adapted global aggregation based on both episode-level and step-level variability. Extensive experiments prove that MobileA3gent achieves superior performance over traditional approaches at only 1% of the cost, highlighting its potential for real-world applications

Abstract: Decentralized learning enables collaborative training of models across naturally distributed data without centralized coordination or maintenance of a global model. Instead, devices are organized in arbitrary communication topologies, in which they can only communicate with neighboring devices. Each device maintains its own local model by training on its local data and integrating new knowledge via model aggregation with neighbors. Therefore, knowledge is propagated across the topology via successive aggregation rounds. We study, in particular, the propagation of out-of-distribution (OOD) knowledge. We find that popular decentralized learning algorithms struggle to propagate OOD knowledge effectively to all devices. Further, we find that both the location of OOD data within a topology, and the topology itself, significantly impact OOD knowledge propagation. We then propose topology-aware aggregation strategies to accelerate (OOD) knowledge propagation across devices. These strategies improve OOD data accuracy, compared to topology-unaware baselines, by 123% on average across models in a topology.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized model training approach that preserves data privacy but struggles with low efficiency. Quantization, a powerful training optimization technique, has been widely explored for integration into FL. However, many studies fail to consider the distinct performance attribution between particular quantization strategies, such as post-training quantization (PTQ) or quantization-aware training (QAT). As a result, existing FL quantization methods rely solely on either PTQ or QAT, optimizing for speed or accuracy while compromising the other. To efficiently accelerate FL and maintain distributed convergence accuracy across various FL settings, this paper proposes a hybrid quantitation approach combining PTQ and QAT for FL systems. We conduct case studies to validate the effectiveness of using hybrid quantization in FL. To solve the difficulty of modeling speed and accuracy caused by device and data heterogeneity, we propose a hardware-related analysis and data-distribution-related analysis to help identify the trade-off boundaries for strategy selection. Based on these, we proposed a novel framework named FedHQ to automatically adopt optimal hybrid strategy allocation for FL systems. Specifically, FedHQ develops a coarse-grained global initialization and fine-grained ML-based adjustment to ensure efficiency and robustness. Experiments show that FedHQ achieves up to 2.47x times training acceleration and up to 11.15% accuracy improvement and negligible extra overhead.

<title>Proof-of-Social-Capital: Privacy-Preserving Consensus Protocol Replacing Stake for Social Capital</title>

arXiv:2505.12144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consensus protocols used today in blockchains often rely on computational power or financial stakes - scarce resources. We propose a novel protocol using social capital - trust and influence from social interactions - as a non-transferable staking mechanism to ensure fairness and decentralization. The methodology integrates zero-knowledge proofs, verifiable credentials, a Whisk-like leader election, and an incentive scheme to prevent Sybil attacks and encourage engagement. The theoretical framework would enhance privacy and equity, though unresolved issues like off-chain bribery require further research. This work offers a new model aligned with modern social media behavior and lifestyle, with applications in finance, providing a practical insight for decentralized system development.

<title>Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning for Privacy-Preserving Robotic-Assisted Surgery</title>

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) holds significant promise for advancing surgical precision, adaptability, and autonomous decision-making. However, the development of robust RL models in clinical settings is hindered by key challenges, including stringent patient data privacy regulations, limited access to diverse surgical datasets, and high procedural variability. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL) framework that enables decentralized training of RL models across multiple healthcare institutions without exposing sensitive patient information. A central innovation of the proposed framework is its dynamic policy adaptation mechanism, which allows surgical robots to select and tailor patient-specific policies in real-time, thereby ensuring personalized and Optimised interventions. To uphold rigorous privacy standards while facilitating collaborative learning, the FDRL framework incorporates secure aggregation, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption techniques. Experimental results demonstrate a 60\% reduction in privacy leakage compared to conventional methods, with surgical precision maintained within a 1.5\% margin of a centralized baseline. This work establishes a foundational approach for adaptive, secure, and patient-centric AI-driven surgical robotics, offering a pathway toward clinical translation and scalable deployment across diverse healthcare environments.

<title>Protocol as Poetry: Case Study on Pak's Protocol Arts</title>

Abstract: Protocol art emerges at the confluence of blockchain-based smart contracts and a century-long lineage of conceptual art, participatory art, and algorithmic generative art practices. Yet existing definitions-most notably Primavera De Filippi's "protocolism"-struggle to demarcate this nascent genre from other art forms in practice. Addressing this definition-to-practice gap, this paper offers a focused case study of pioneering protocol artworks by Pak, an early and influential pseudonymous protocol artist who treats smart contracts as medium and protocol participation as message. Tracing the evolution from early open-edition releases of The Fungible and the dynamic mechanics of Merge to the soul-bound messaging of Censored and the reflective absence of Not Found, we examine how Pak choreographs distributed agency across collectors and autonomous contracts, showing how programmable protocols become a social fabric in artistic meaning-making. Through thematic analysis of Pak's works, we identify seven core characteristics that distinguish protocol art: (1) system-centric rather than object-centric composition, (2) autonomous governance for open-ended control, (3) distributed agency and communal authorship, (4) temporal dynamism and lifecycle aesthetics, (5) economic-driven engagement, (6) poetic message embedding in interaction rituals, and (7) interoperability enabling composability for emergence. We then discuss how these features set protocol art apart from adjacent artistic movements. By developing a theoretical framework grounded in Pak's practice, we contribute to the emerging literature on protocolism while offering design implications for artists shaping this evolving art form.

<title>hChain: Blockchain Based Large Scale EHR Data Sharing with Enhanced Security and Privacy</title>

Abstract: Concerns regarding privacy and data security in conventional healthcare prompted alternative technologies. In smart healthcare, blockchain technology addresses existing concerns with security, privacy, and electronic healthcare transmission. Integration of Blockchain Technology with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) allows real-time monitoring of protected healthcare data. Utilizing edge devices with IoMT devices is very advantageous for addressing security, computing, and storage challenges. Encryption using symmetric and asymmetric keys is used to conceal sensitive information from unauthorized parties. SHA256 is an algorithm for one-way hashing. It is used to verify that the data has not been altered, since if it had, the hash value would have changed. This article offers a blockchain-based smart healthcare system using IoMT devices for continuous patient monitoring. In addition, it employs edge resources in addition to IoMT devices to have extra computing power and storage to hash and encrypt incoming data before sending it to the blockchain. Symmetric key is utilized to keep the data private even in the blockchain, allowing the patient to safely communicate the data through smart contracts while preventing unauthorized physicians from seeing the data. Through the use of a verification node and blockchain, an asymmetric key is used for the signing and validation of patient data in the healthcare provider system. In addition to other security measures, location-based authentication is recommended to guarantee that data originates from the patient area. Through the edge device, SHA256 is utilized to secure the data's integrity and a secret key is used to maintain its secrecy. The hChain architecture improves the computing power of IoMT environments, the security of EHR sharing through smart contracts, and the privacy and authentication procedures.

<title>Towards Effective Federated Graph Foundation Model via Mitigating Knowledge Entanglement</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM) offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines, missing out on cross-silo data and resources.
  These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering downstream adaptation.
  To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors. Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains, providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2) AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream adaptation.
  FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated GFM variants.

Abstract: This paper reports on findings from a comparative study on the effectiveness and efficiency of federated unlearning strategies within Federated Online Learning to Rank (FOLTR), with specific attention to systematically analysing the unlearning capabilities of methods in a verifiable manner.
  Federated approaches to ranking of search results have recently garnered attention to address users privacy concerns. In FOLTR, privacy is safeguarded by collaboratively training ranking models across decentralized data sources, preserving individual user data while optimizing search results based on implicit feedback, such as clicks.
  Recent legislation introduced across numerous countries is establishing the so called "the right to be forgotten", according to which services based on machine learning models like those in FOLTR should provide capabilities that allow users to remove their own data from those used to train models. This has sparked the development of unlearning methods, along with evaluation practices to measure whether unlearning of a user data successfully occurred. Current evaluation practices are however often controversial, necessitating the use of multiple metrics for a more comprehensive assessment -- but previous proposals of unlearning methods only used single evaluation metrics.
  This paper addresses this limitation: our study rigorously assesses the effectiveness of unlearning strategies in managing both under-unlearning and over-unlearning scenarios using adapted, and newly proposed evaluation metrics. Thanks to our detailed analysis, we uncover the strengths and limitations of five unlearning strategies, offering valuable insights into optimizing federated unlearning to balance data privacy and system performance within FOLTR. We publicly release our code and complete results at https://github.com/Iris1026/Unlearning-for-FOLTR.git.

Abstract: Smart railways integrate advanced information technologies into railway operating systems to improve efficiency and reliability. Although the development of 5G has enhanced railway services, future smart railways require ultra-high speeds, ultra-low latency, ultra-high security, full coverage, and ultra-high positioning accuracy, which 5G cannot fully meet. Therefore, 6G is envisioned to provide green and efficient all-day operations, strong information security, fully automatic driving, and low-cost intelligent maintenance. To achieve these requirements, we propose an integrated network architecture leveraging communications, computing, edge intelligence, and caching in railway systems. We have conducted in-depth investigations on key enabling technologies for reliable transmissions and wireless coverage. For high-speed mobile scenarios, we propose an AI-enabled cross-domain channel modeling and orthogonal time-frequency space-time spread multiple access mechanism to alleviate the conflict between limited spectrum availability and massive user access. The roles of blockchain, edge intelligence, and privacy technologies in endogenously secure rail communications are also evaluated. We further explore the application of emerging paradigms such as integrated sensing and communications, AI-assisted Internet of Things, semantic communications, and digital twin networks for railway maintenance, monitoring, prediction, and accident warning. Finally, possible future research and development directions are discussed.

<title>OmniFC: Rethinking Federated Clustering via Lossless and Secure Distance Reconstruction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.13071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated clustering (FC) aims to discover global cluster structures across decentralized clients without sharing raw data, making privacy preservation a fundamental requirement. There are two critical challenges: (1) privacy leakage during collaboration, and (2) robustness degradation due to aggregation of proxy information from non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) local data, leading to inaccurate or inconsistent global clustering. Existing solutions typically rely on model-specific local proxies, which are sensitive to data heterogeneity and inherit inductive biases from their centralized counterparts, thus limiting robustness and generality. We propose Omni Federated Clustering (OmniFC), a unified and model-agnostic framework. Leveraging Lagrange coded computing, our method enables clients to share only encoded data, allowing exact reconstruction of the global distance matrix--a fundamental representation of sample relationships--without leaking private information, even under client collusion. This construction is naturally resilient to Non-IID data distributions. This approach decouples FC from model-specific proxies, providing a unified extension mechanism applicable to diverse centralized clustering methods. Theoretical analysis confirms both reconstruction fidelity and privacy guarantees, while comprehensive experiments demonstrate OmniFC's superior robustness, effectiveness, and generality across various benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code will be released.

<title>RIFLES: Resource-effIcient Federated LEarning via Scheduling</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that allows decentralized collaborative model training across a set of distributed clients, by avoiding raw data exchange. A fundamental component of FL is the selection of a subset of clients in each round for model training by a central server. Current selection strategies are myopic in nature in that they are based on past or current interactions, often leading to inefficiency issues such as straggling clients. In this paper, we address this serious shortcoming by proposing the RIFLES approach that builds a novel availability forecasting layer to support the client selection process. We make the following contributions: (i) we formalise the sequential selection problem and reduce it to a scheduling problem and show that the problem is NP-complete, (ii) leveraging heartbeat messages from clients, RIFLES build an availability prediction layer to support (long term) selection decisions, (iii) we propose a novel adaptive selection strategy to support efficient learning and resource usage. To circumvent the inherent exponential complexity, we present RIFLES, a heuristic that leverages clients' historical availability data by using a CNN-LSTM time series forecasting model, allowing the server to predict the optimal participation times of clients, thereby enabling informed selection decisions. By comparing against other FL techniques, we show that RIFLES provide significant improvement by between 10%-50% on a variety of metrics such as accuracy and test loss. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to investigate FL as a scheduling problem.

<title>Hybrid Voting-Based Task Assignment in Modular Construction Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Modular construction, involving off-site prefabrication and on-site assembly, offers significant advantages but presents complex coordination challenges for robotic automation. Effective task allocation is critical for leveraging multi-agent systems (MAS) in these structured environments. This paper introduces the Hybrid Voting-Based Task Assignment (HVBTA) framework, a novel approach to optimizing collaboration between heterogeneous multi-agent construction teams. Inspired by human reasoning in task delegation, HVBTA uniquely integrates multiple voting mechanisms with the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) for nuanced suitability assessment between agent capabilities and task requirements. The framework operates by assigning Capability Profiles to agents and detailed requirement lists called Task Descriptions to construction tasks, subsequently generating a quantitative Suitability Matrix. Six distinct voting methods, augmented by a pre-trained LLM, analyze this matrix to robustly identify the optimal agent for each task. Conflict-Based Search (CBS) is integrated for decentralized, collision-free path planning, ensuring efficient and safe spatio-temporal coordination of the robotic team during assembly operations. HVBTA enables efficient, conflict-free assignment and coordination, facilitating potentially faster and more accurate modular assembly. Current work is evaluating HVBTA's performance across various simulated construction scenarios involving diverse robotic platforms and task complexities. While designed as a generalizable framework for any domain with clearly definable tasks and capabilities, HVBTA will be particularly effective for addressing the demanding coordination requirements of multi-agent collaborative robotics in modular construction due to the predetermined construction planning involved.

Abstract: In the age of cloud computing, data privacy protection has become a major challenge, especially when sharing sensitive data across cloud environments. However, how to optimize collaboration across cloud environments remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we combine federated learning with large-scale language models to optimize the collaborative mechanism of AI systems. Based on the existing federated learning framework, we introduce a cross-cloud architecture in which federated learning works by aggregating model updates from decentralized nodes without exposing the original data. At the same time, combined with large-scale language models, its powerful context and semantic understanding capabilities are used to improve model training efficiency and decision-making ability. We've further innovated by introducing a secure communication layer to ensure the privacy and integrity of model updates and training data. The model enables continuous model adaptation and fine-tuning across different cloud environments while protecting sensitive data. Experimental results show that the proposed method is significantly better than the traditional federated learning model in terms of accuracy, convergence speed and data privacy protection.

Abstract: In virtual reality (VR) environments, computational tasks exhibit an elastic nature, meaning they can dynamically adjust based on various user and system constraints. This elasticity is essential for maintaining immersive experiences; however, it also introduces challenges for communication and computing in VR systems. In this paper, we investigate elastic task offloading for multi-user edge-computing-enabled VR systems with multi-connectivity, aiming to maximize the computational energy-efficiency (computational throughput per unit of energy consumed). To balance the induced communication, computation, energy consumption, and quality of experience trade-offs due to the elasticity of VR tasks, we formulate a constrained stochastic computational energy-efficiency optimization problem that integrates the multi-connectivity/multi-user action space and the elastic nature of VR computational tasks. We formulate a centralized phasic policy gradient (CPPG) framework to solve the problem of interest online, using only prior elastic task offloading statistics (energy consumption, response time, and transmission time), and task information (i.e., task size and computational intensity), while observing the induced system performance (energy consumption and latency). We further extend our approach to decentralized learning by formulating an independent phasic policy gradient (IPPG) method and a decentralized shared multi-armed bandit (DSMAB) method. We train our methods with real-world 4G, 5G, and WiGig network traces and 360 video datasets to evaluate their performance in terms of response time, energy efficiency, scalability, and delivered quality of experience. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of task size and its effect on offloading policy and system performance. In particular, we show that CPPG reduces latency by 28% and energy consumption by 78% compared to IPPG.

Abstract: Increased robot deployment, such as in warehousing, has revealed a need for seamless collaboration among heterogeneous robot teams to resolve unforeseen conflicts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel, decentralized framework for robots to request and provide help. The framework begins with robots detecting conflicts using a Vision Language Model (VLM), then reasoning over whether help is needed. If so, it crafts and broadcasts a natural language (NL) help request using a Large Language Model (LLM). Potential helper robots reason over the request and offer help (if able), along with information about impact to their current tasks. Helper reasoning is implemented via an LLM grounded in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) using a Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar to guarantee syntactically valid NL-to-STL translations, which are then solved as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Finally, the requester robot chooses a helper by reasoning over impact on the overall system. We evaluate our system via experiments considering different strategies for choosing a helper, and find that a requester robot can minimize overall time impact on the system by considering multiple help offers versus simple heuristics (e.g., selecting the nearest robot to help).

Abstract: Traffic congestion has long been an ubiquitous problem that is exacerbating with the rapid growth of megacities. In this proof-of-concept work we study intrinsic motivation, implemented via the empowerment principle, to control autonomous car behavior to improve traffic flow. In standard models of traffic dynamics, self-organized traffic jams emerge spontaneously from the individual behavior of cars, affecting traffic over long distances. Our novel car behavior strategy improves traffic flow while still being decentralized and using only locally available information without explicit coordination. Decentralization is essential for various reasons, not least to be able to absorb robustly substantial levels of uncertainty. Our scenario is based on the well-established traffic dynamics model, the Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular automaton. In a fraction of the cars in this model, we substitute the default behavior by empowerment, our intrinsic motivation-based method. This proposed model significantly improves overall traffic flow, mitigates congestion, and reduces the average traffic jam time.

Abstract: Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have transformed organizational structures by shifting from traditional hierarchical control to decentralized approaches, leveraging blockchain and cryptoeconomics. Despite managing significant funds and building global networks, DAOs face challenges like declining participation, increasing centralization, and inabilities to adapt to changing environments, which stifle innovation. This paper explores DAOs as complex systems and applies complexity science to explain their inefficiencies. In particular, we discuss DAO challenges, their complex nature, and introduce the self-organization mechanisms of collective intelligence, digital democracy, and adaptation. By applying these mechanisms to refine DAO design and construction, a conceptual framework for assessing a DAO's viability is created. This contribution lays the foundation for future research at the intersection of complexity science, digital democracy and DAOs.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving privacy. Recently, the integration of Foundation Models (FMs) into FL has enhanced performance but introduced a novel backdoor attack mechanism. Attackers can exploit FM vulnerabilities to embed backdoors into synthetic data generated by FMs. During global model fusion, these backdoors are transferred to the global model through compromised synthetic data, subsequently infecting all client models. Existing FL backdoor defenses are ineffective against this novel attack due to its fundamentally different mechanism compared to classic ones. In this work, we propose a novel data-free defense strategy that addresses both classic and novel backdoor attacks in FL. The shared attack pattern lies in the abnormal activations within the hidden feature space during model aggregation. Hence, we propose to constrain internal activations to remain within reasonable ranges, effectively mitigating attacks while preserving model functionality. The activation constraints are optimized using synthetic data alongside FL training. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness against both novel and classic backdoor attacks, outperforming existing defenses.

Abstract: Merging and splitting are of great significance for rigid body networks in making such networks reconfigurable. The main challenges lie in simultaneously ensuring the compositionality of the distributed controllers and the mesh stability of the entire network. To this end, we propose a decentralized control and topology co-design method for rigid body networks, which enables flexible joining and leaving of rigid bodies without the need to redesign the controllers for the entire network after such maneuvers. We first provide a centralized linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based control and topology co-design optimization of the rigid body networks with a formal mesh stability guarantee. Then, these centralized mesh stability constraints are made decentralized by a proposed alternative set of sufficient conditions. Using these decentralized mesh stability constraints and Sylvester's criterion-based decentralization techniques, the said centralized LMI problem is equivalently broken down into a set of smaller decentralized LMI problems that can be solved at each rigid body, enabling flexible merging/splitting of rigid bodies. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed co-design method is illustrated based on a specifically developed simulator and a comparison study with respect to a state-of-the-art method.

<title>Nosy Layers, Noisy Fixes: Tackling DRAs in Federated Learning Systems using Explainable AI</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative model training while keeping client data decentralized and private. However, it is vulnerable to Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRA) such as "LoKI" and "Robbing the Fed", where malicious models sent from the server to the client can reconstruct sensitive user data. To counter this, we introduce DRArmor, a novel defense mechanism that integrates Explainable AI with targeted detection and mitigation strategies for DRA. Unlike existing defenses that focus on the entire model, DRArmor identifies and addresses the root cause (i.e., malicious layers within the model that send gradients with malicious intent) by analyzing their contribution to the output and detecting inconsistencies in gradient values. Once these malicious layers are identified, DRArmor applies defense techniques such as noise injection, pixelation, and pruning to these layers rather than the whole model, minimizing the attack surface and preserving client data privacy. We evaluate DRArmor's performance against the advanced LoKI attack across diverse datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, in a 200-client FL setup. Our results demonstrate DRArmor's effectiveness in mitigating data leakage, achieving high True Positive and True Negative Rates of 0.910 and 0.890, respectively. Additionally, DRArmor maintains an average accuracy of 87%, effectively protecting client privacy without compromising model performance. Compared to existing defense mechanisms, DRArmor reduces the data leakage rate by 62.5% with datasets containing 500 samples per client.

To maximize the benefits of competitive retail energy markets, group purchasing is an emerging paradigm that aggregates consumers' purchasing power by coordinating switch decisions to specific energy providers for discounted energy plans. Traditionally, group purchasing is mediated by a trusted third-party, which suffers from the lack of privacy and transparency. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm of decentralized privacy-preserving group purchasing, empowered by privacy-preserving blockchain and secure multi-party computation, to enable users to form a coalition for coordinated switch decisions in a decentralized manner, without a trusted third-party. The coordinated switch decisions are determined by a competitive online algorithm, based on users' private consumption data and current energy plan tariffs. Remarkably, no private user consumption data will be revealed to others in the online decision-making process, which is carried out in a transparently verifiable manner to eliminate frauds from dishonest users and supports fair mutual compensations by sharing the switching costs to incentivize group purchasing. We implemented our decentralized group purchasing solution as a smart contract on Solidity-supported blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum), and provide extensive empirical evaluation.

Abstract: Scam contracts on Ethereum have rapidly evolved alongside the rise of DeFi and NFT ecosystems, utilizing increasingly complex code obfuscation techniques to avoid early detection. This paper systematically investigates how obfuscation amplifies the financial risks of fraudulent contracts and undermines existing auditing tools. We propose a transfer-centric obfuscation taxonomy, distilling seven key features, and introduce ObfProbe, a framework that performs bytecode-level smart contract analysis to uncover obfuscation techniques and quantify obfuscation complexity via Z-score ranking. In a large-scale study of 1.03 million Ethereum contracts, we isolate over 3 000 highly obfuscated contracts and identify two scam archetypes, three high-risk contract categories, and MEV bots that employ a variety of obfuscation maneuvers such as inline assembly, dead code insertion, and deep function splitting. We further show that obfuscation substantially increases both the scale of financial damage and the time until detection. Finally, we evaluate SourceP, a state-of-the-art Ponzi detection tool, on obfuscated versus non-obfuscated samples and observe its accuracy drop from approximately 80 percent to approximately 12 percent in real-world scenarios. These findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced anti-obfuscation analysis techniques and broader community collaboration to stem the proliferation of scam contracts in the expanding DeFi ecosystem.

Abstract: Classic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods require that agents enjoy global state observability, preventing development of decentralized algorithms and limiting scalability. Recent work has shown that, under assumptions on decaying inter-agent influence, global observability can be replaced by local neighborhood observability at each agent, enabling decentralization and scalability. Real-world applications enjoying such decay properties remain underexplored, however, despite the fact that signal power decay, or signal attenuation, due to path loss is an intrinsic feature of many problems in wireless communications and radar networks. In this paper, we show that signal attenuation enables decentralization in MARL by considering the illustrative special case of performing power allocation for target detection in a radar network. To achieve this, we propose two new constrained multi-agent Markov decision process formulations of this power allocation problem, derive local neighborhood approximations for global value function and gradient estimates and establish corresponding error bounds, and develop decentralized saddle point policy gradient algorithms for solving the proposed problems. Our approach, though oriented towards the specific radar network problem we consider, provides a useful model for future extensions to additional problems in wireless communications and radar networks.

<title>Communication-Efficient Federated Learning Based on Explanation-Guided Pruning for Remote Sensing Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm in which multiple clients collaboratively train a global model by exchanging only model updates with the central server without sharing the local data of the clients. Due to the large volume of model updates required to be transmitted between clients and the central server, most FL systems are associated with high transfer costs (i.e., communication overhead). This issue is more critical for operational applications in remote sensing (RS), especially when large-scale RS data is processed and analyzed through FL systems with restricted communication bandwidth. To address this issue, we introduce an explanation-guided pruning strategy for communication-efficient FL in the context of RS image classification. Our pruning strategy is defined based on the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) driven explanations to: 1) efficiently and effectively identify the most relevant and informative model parameters (to be exchanged between clients and the central server); and 2) eliminate the non-informative ones to minimize the volume of model updates. The experimental results on the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset demonstrate that our strategy effectively reduces the number of shared model updates, while increasing the generalization ability of the global model. The code of this work is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/FL-LRP.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) presents an effective solution for collaborative model training while maintaining data privacy across decentralized client datasets. However, data quality issues such as noisy labels, missing classes, and imbalanced distributions significantly challenge its effectiveness. This study proposes a federated learning methodology that systematically addresses data quality issues, including noise, class imbalance, and missing labels. The proposed approach systematically enhances data integrity through adaptive noise cleaning, collaborative conditional GAN-based synthetic data generation, and robust federated model training. Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets (MNIST and Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate significant improvements in federated model performance, particularly macro-F1 Score, under varying noise and class imbalance conditions. Additionally, the proposed framework carefully balances computational feasibility and substantial performance gains, ensuring practicality for resource constrained edge devices while rigorously maintaining data privacy. Our results indicate that this method effectively mitigates common data quality challenges, providing a robust, scalable, and privacy compliant solution suitable for diverse real-world federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: The recent trend of self-sovereign Decentralized AI Agents (DeAgents) combines Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI agents with decentralization technologies such as blockchain smart contracts and trusted execution environments (TEEs). These tamper-resistant trustless substrates allow agents to achieve self-sovereignty through ownership of cryptowallet private keys and control of digital assets and social media accounts. DeAgent eliminates centralized control and reduces human intervention, addressing key trust concerns inherent in centralized AI systems. However, given ongoing challenges in LLM reliability such as hallucinations, this creates paradoxical tension between trustlessness and unreliable autonomy. This study addresses this empirical research gap through interviews with DeAgents stakeholders-experts, founders, and developers-to examine their motivations, benefits, and governance dilemmas. The findings will guide future DeAgents system and protocol design and inform discussions about governance in sociotechnical AI systems in the future agentic web.

Abstract: As demand for intelligent services rises and edge devices become more capable, distributed learning at the network edge has emerged as a key enabling technology. While existing paradigms like federated learning (FL) and decentralized FL (DFL) enable privacy-preserving distributed learning in many scenarios, they face potential challenges in connectivity and synchronization imposed by resource-constrained and infrastructure-less environments. While more robust, gossip learning (GL) algorithms have generally been designed for homogeneous data distributions and may not suit all contexts. This paper introduces Chisme, a novel suite of protocols designed to address the challenges of implementing robust intelligence in the network edge, characterized by heterogeneous data distributions, episodic connectivity, and lack of infrastructure. Chisme includes both synchronous DFL (Chisme-DFL) and asynchronous GL (Chisme-GL) variants that enable collaborative yet decentralized model training that considers underlying data heterogeneity. We introduce a data similarity heuristic that allows agents to opportunistically infer affinity with each other using the existing communication of model updates in decentralized FL and GL. We leverage the heuristic to extend DFL's model aggregation and GL's model merge mechanisms for better personalized training while maintaining collaboration. While Chisme-DFL is a synchronous decentralized approach whose resource utilization scales linearly with network size, Chisme-GL is fully asynchronous and has a lower, constant resource requirement independent of network size. We demonstrate that Chisme methods outperform their standard counterparts in model training over distributed and heterogeneous data in network scenarios ranging from less connected and reliable networks to fully connected and lossless networks.

Abstract: The untraceability of transactions facilitated by Ethereum mixing services like Tornado Cash poses significant challenges to blockchain security and financial regulation. Existing methods for correlating mixing accounts suffer from limited labeled data and vulnerability to noisy annotations, which restrict their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose StealthLink, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through cross-task domain-invariant feature learning. Our key innovation lies in transferring knowledge from the well-studied domain of blockchain anomaly detection to the data-scarce task of mixing transaction tracing. Specifically, we design a MixFusion module that constructs and encodes mixing subgraphs to capture local transactional patterns, while introducing a knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns discriminative features across domains through adversarial discrepancy minimization. This dual approach enables robust feature learning under label scarcity and distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on real-world mixing transaction datasets demonstrate that StealthLink achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 96.98\% F1-score in 10-shot learning scenarios. Notably, our framework shows superior generalization capability in imbalanced data conditions than conventional supervised methods. This work establishes the first systematic approach for cross-domain knowledge transfer in blockchain forensics, providing a practical solution for combating privacy-enhanced financial crimes in decentralized ecosystems.

Abstract: Smart contracts have been a topic of interest in blockchain research and are a key enabling technology for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in the era of Web 3.0. These contracts enable trustless interactions without the need for intermediaries, as they operate based on predefined rules encoded on the blockchain. However, smart contacts face significant challenges in cross-contract communication and information sharing, making it difficult to establish seamless connectivity and collaboration among CAVs with Web 3.0. In this paper, we propose DeFeed, a novel secure protocol that incorporates various gas-saving functions for CAVs, originated from in-depth research into the interaction among smart contracts for decentralized cross-contract data feed in Web 3.0. DeFeed allows smart contracts to obtain information from other contracts efficiently in a single click, without complicated operations. We judiciously design and complete various functions with DeFeed, including a pool function and a cache function for gas optimization, a subscribe function for facilitating data access, and an update function for the future iteration of our protocol. Tailored for CAVs with Web 3.0 use cases, DeFeed enables efficient data feed between smart contracts underpinning decentralized applications and vehicle coordination. Implemented and tested on the Ethereum official test network, DeFeed demonstrates significant improvements in contract interaction efficiency, reducing computational complexity and gas costs. Our solution represents a critical step towards seamless, decentralized communication in Web 3.0 ecosystems.

arXiv:2505.10152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated domain generalization aims to learn a generalizable model from multiple decentralized source domains for deploying on the unseen target domain. The style augmentation methods have achieved great progress on domain generalization. However, the existing style augmentation methods either explore the data styles within isolated source domain or interpolate the style information across existing source domains under the data decentralization scenario, which leads to limited style space. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-source Collaborative Style Augmentation and Domain-invariant learning method (MCSAD) for federated domain generalization. Specifically, we propose a multi-source collaborative style augmentation module to generate data in the broader style space. Furthermore, we conduct domain-invariant learning between the original data and augmented data by cross-domain feature alignment within the same class and classes relation ensemble distillation between different classes to learn a domain-invariant model. By alternatively conducting collaborative style augmentation and domain-invariant learning, the model can generalize well on unseen target domain. Extensive experiments on multiple domain generalization datasets indicate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated domain generalization methods.

<title>Optimizing Electric Bus Charging Scheduling with Uncertainties Using Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The growing adoption of Electric Buses (EBs) represents a significant step toward sustainable development. By utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) systems, charging stations can autonomously determine charging schedules based on real-time data. However, optimizing EB charging schedules remains a critical challenge due to uncertainties in travel time, energy consumption, and fluctuating electricity prices. Moreover, to address real-world complexities, charging policies must make decisions efficiently across multiple time scales and remain scalable for large EB fleets. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) approach that reformulates the original Markov Decision Process (MDP) into two augmented MDPs. To solve these MDPs and enable multi-timescale decision-making, we introduce a novel HDRL algorithm, namely Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization Enhancement (DAC-MAPPO-E). Scalability challenges of the Double Actor-Critic (DAC) algorithm for large-scale EB fleets are addressed through enhancements at both decision levels. At the high level, we redesign the decentralized actor network and integrate an attention mechanism to extract relevant global state information for each EB, decreasing the size of neural networks. At the low level, the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is incorporated into the DAC framework, enabling decentralized and coordinated charging power decisions, reducing computational complexity and enhancing convergence speed. Extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of DAC-MAPPO-E in optimizing EB fleet charging schedules.

<title>One For All: Formally Verifying Protocols which use Aggregate Signatures (extended version)</title>

Abstract: Aggregate signatures are digital signatures that compress multiple signatures from different parties into a single signature, thereby reducing storage and bandwidth requirements. BLS aggregate signatures are a popular kind of aggregate signature, deployed by Ethereum, Dfinity, and Cloudflare amongst others, currently undergoing standardization at the IETF. However, BLS aggregate signatures are difficult to use correctly, with nuanced requirements that must be carefully handled by protocol developers.
  In this work, we design the first models of aggregate signatures that enable formal verification tools, such as Tamarin and ProVerif, to be applied to protocols using these signatures. We introduce general models that are based on the cryptographic security definition of generic aggregate signatures, allowing the attacker to exploit protocols where the security requirements are not satisfied. We also introduce a second family of models formalizing BLS aggregate signatures in particular. We demonstrate our approach's practical relevance by modelling and analyzing in Tamarin a device attestation protocol called SANA. Despite SANA's claimed correctness proof, with Tamarin we uncover undocumented assumptions that, when omitted, lead to attacks.

Abstract: Decentralized optimization has become vital for leveraging distributed data without central control, enhancing scalability and privacy. However, practical deployments face fundamental challenges due to heterogeneous computation speeds and unpredictable communication delays. This paper introduces a refined model of Asynchronous Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (ADSGD) under practical assumptions of bounded computation and communication times. To understand the convergence of ADSGD, we first analyze Asynchronous Stochastic Block Coordinate Descent (ASBCD) as a tool, and then show that ADSGD converges under computation-delay-independent step sizes. The convergence result is established without assuming bounded data heterogeneity. Empirical experiments reveal that ADSGD outperforms existing methods in wall-clock convergence time across various scenarios. With its simplicity, efficiency in memory and communication, and resilience to communication and computation delays, ADSGD is well-suited for real-world decentralized learning tasks.

Abstract: With the rise of decentralized computing, as in the Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and personalized healthcare, it is increasingly important to process time-dependent signals at the edge efficiently: right at the place where the temporal data are collected, avoiding time-consuming, insecure, and costly communication with a centralized computing facility (or cloud). However, modern-day processors often cannot meet the restrained power and time budgets of edge systems because of intrinsic limitations imposed by their architecture (von Neumann bottleneck) or domain conversions (analogue-to-digital and time-to-frequency). Here, we propose an edge temporal-signal processor based on two in-materia computing systems for both feature extraction and classification, reaching a software-level accuracy of 96.2% for the TI-46-Word speech-recognition task. First, a nonlinear, room-temperature dopant-network-processing-unit (DNPU) layer realizes analogue, time-domain feature extraction from the raw audio signals, similar to the human cochlea. Second, an analogue in-memory computing (AIMC) chip, consisting of memristive crossbar arrays, implements a compact neural network trained on the extracted features for classification. With the DNPU feature extraction consuming 100s nW and AIMC-based classification having the potential for less than 10 fJ per multiply-accumulate operation, our findings offer a promising avenue for advancing the compactness, efficiency, and performance of heterogeneous smart edge processors through in-materia computing hardware.

Abstract: Onboard learning is a transformative approach in edge AI, enabling real-time data processing, decision-making, and adaptive model training directly on resource-constrained devices without relying on centralized servers. This paradigm is crucial for applications demanding low latency, enhanced privacy, and energy efficiency. However, onboard learning faces challenges such as limited computational resources, high inference costs, and security vulnerabilities. This survey explores a comprehensive range of methodologies that address these challenges, focusing on techniques that optimize model efficiency, accelerate inference, and support collaborative learning across distributed devices. Approaches for reducing model complexity, improving inference speed, and ensuring privacy-preserving computation are examined alongside emerging strategies that enhance scalability and adaptability in dynamic environments. By bridging advancements in hardware-software co-design, model compression, and decentralized learning, this survey provides insights into the current state of onboard learning to enable robust, efficient, and secure AI deployment at the edge.

Abstract: The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has recently emerged as a core element in the 6G networks. However, traditional centralized and synchronous optimization algorithms are unsuitable for SAGIN due to infrastructureless and time-varying environments. This paper aims to develop a novel Asynchronous algorithm a.k.a. Argus for tackling non-convex and non-smooth decentralized federated bilevel learning over SAGIN. The proposed algorithm allows networked agents (e.g. autonomous aerial vehicles) to tackle bilevel learning problems in time-varying networks asynchronously, thereby averting stragglers from impeding the overall training speed. We provide a theoretical analysis of the iteration complexity, communication complexity, and computational complexity of Argus. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated through numerical experiments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global machine learning model without sharing their raw data. However, the decentralized nature of FL introduces vulnerabilities, particularly to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients manipulate their local models to disrupt the training process. While Byzantine-robust aggregation rules have been developed to mitigate such attacks, they remain inadequate against more advanced threats. In response, recent advancements have focused on FL detection techniques to identify potentially malicious participants. Unfortunately, these methods often misclassify numerous benign clients as threats or rely on unrealistic assumptions about the server's capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, SafeFL, specifically designed to accurately identify malicious clients in FL. The SafeFL approach involves the server collecting a series of global models to generate a synthetic dataset, which is then used to distinguish between malicious and benign models based on their behavior. Extensive testing demonstrates that SafeFL outperforms existing methods, offering superior efficiency and accuracy in detecting malicious clients.

Abstract: We present Latent Theory of Mind (LatentToM), a decentralized diffusion policy architecture for collaborative robot manipulation. Our policy allows multiple manipulators with their own perception and computation to collaborate with each other towards a common task goal with or without explicit communication. Our key innovation lies in allowing each agent to maintain two latent representations: an ego embedding specific to the robot, and a consensus embedding trained to be common to both robots, despite their different sensor streams and poses. We further let each robot train a decoder to infer the other robot's ego embedding from their consensus embedding, akin to theory of mind in latent space. Training occurs centrally, with all the policies' consensus encoders supervised by a loss inspired by sheaf theory, a mathematical theory for clustering data on a topological manifold. Specifically, we introduce a first-order cohomology loss to enforce sheaf-consistent alignment of the consensus embeddings. To preserve the expressiveness of the consensus embedding, we further propose structural constraints based on theory of mind and a directional consensus mechanism. Execution can be fully distributed, requiring no explicit communication between policies. In which case, the information is exchanged implicitly through each robot's sensor stream by observing the actions of the other robots and their effects on the scene. Alternatively, execution can leverage direct communication to share the robots' consensus embeddings, where the embeddings are shared once during each inference step and are aligned using the sheaf Laplacian. In our hardware experiments, LatentToM outperforms a naive decentralized diffusion baseline, and shows comparable performance with a state-of-the-art centralized diffusion policy for bi-manual manipulation.

Abstract: Sybil attacks pose a significant security threat to blockchain ecosystems, particularly in token airdrop events. This paper proposes a novel sybil address identification method based on subgraph feature extraction lightGBM. The method first constructs a two-layer deep transaction subgraph for each address, then extracts key event operation features according to the lifecycle of sybil addresses, including the time of first transaction, first gas acquisition, participation in airdrop activities, and last transaction. These temporal features effectively capture the consistency of sybil address behavior operations. Additionally, the method extracts amount and network structure features, comprehensively describing address behavior patterns and network topology through feature propagation and fusion. Experiments conducted on a dataset containing 193,701 addresses (including 23,240 sybil addresses) show that this method outperforms existing approaches in terms of precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC, with all metrics exceeding 0.9. The methods and results of this study can be further applied to broader blockchain security areas such as transaction manipulation identification and token liquidity risk assessment, contributing to the construction of a more secure and fair blockchain ecosystem.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for real-world applications, and multi-agent interactions introduce additional safety challenges. While Probabilistic Logic Shields (PLS) has been a powerful proposal to enforce safety in single-agent RL, their generalizability to multi-agent settings remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by conducting extensive analyses of PLS within decentralized, multi-agent environments, and in doing so, propose Shielded Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (SMARL) as a general framework for steering MARL towards norm-compliant outcomes. Our key contributions are: (1) a novel Probabilistic Logic Temporal Difference (PLTD) update for shielded, independent Q-learning, which incorporates probabilistic constraints directly into the value update process; (2) a probabilistic logic policy gradient method for shielded PPO with formal safety guarantees for MARL; and (3) comprehensive evaluation across symmetric and asymmetrically shielded $n$-player game-theoretic benchmarks, demonstrating fewer constraint violations and significantly better cooperation under normative constraints. These results position SMARL as an effective mechanism for equilibrium selection, paving the way toward safer, socially aligned multi-agent systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces MACH, a novel approach for optimizing task handover in vehicular computing scenarios. To ensure fast and latency-aware placement of tasks, the decision-making -- where and when should tasks be offloaded -- is carried out decentralized at the Road Side Units (RSUs) who also execute the tasks. By shifting control to the network edge, MACH moves away from the traditional centralized or vehicle-based handover method. Still, it focuses on contextual factors, such as the current RSU load and vehicle trajectories. Thus, MACH improves the overall Quality of Service (QoS) while fairly balancing computational loads between RSUs. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we develop a robust simulation environment composed of real-world traffic data, dynamic network conditions, and different infrastructure capacities. For scenarios that demand low latency and high reliability, our experimental results demonstrate how MACH significantly improves the adaptability and efficiency of vehicular computations. By decentralizing control to the network edge, MACH effectively reduces communication overhead and optimizes resource utilization, offering a robust framework for task handover management.

Abstract: The convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the emergence of AI-based tokens, which are cryptographic assets designed to power decentralized AI platforms and services. This paper provides a comprehensive review of leading AI-token projects, examining their technical architectures, token utilities, consensus mechanisms, and underlying business models. We explore how these tokens operate across various blockchain ecosystems and assess the extent to which they offer value beyond traditional centralized AI services. Based on this assessment, our analysis identifies several core limitations. From a technical perspective, many platforms depend extensively on off-chain computation, exhibit limited capabilities for on-chain intelligence, and encounter significant scalability challenges. From a business perspective, many models appear to replicate centralized AI service structures, simply adding token-based payment and governance layers without delivering truly novel value. In light of these challenges, we also examine emerging developments that may shape the next phase of decentralized AI systems. These include approaches for on-chain verification of AI outputs, blockchain-enabled federated learning, and more robust incentive frameworks. Collectively, while emerging innovations offer pathways to strengthen decentralized AI ecosystems, significant gaps remain between the promises and the realities of current AI-token implementations. Our findings contribute to a growing body of research at the intersection of AI and blockchain, highlighting the need for critical evaluation and more grounded approaches as the field continues to evolve.

Abstract: Twenty-five years ago, the specification of the Intelligent Product was established, envisaging real-time connectivity that not only enables products to gather accurate data about themselves but also allows them to assess and influence their own destiny. Early work by the Auto-ID project focused on creating a single, open-standard repository for storing and retrieving product information, laying a foundation for scalable connectivity. A decade later, the approach was revisited in light of low-cost RFID systems that promised a low-cost link between physical goods and networked information environments. Since then, advances in blockchain, Web3, and artificial intelligence have introduced unprecedented levels of resilience, consensus, and autonomy. By leveraging decentralised identity, blockchain-based product information and history, and intelligent AI-to-AI collaboration, this paper examines these developments and outlines a new specification for the Intelligent Product 3.0, illustrating how decentralised and AI-driven capabilities facilitate seamless interaction between physical AI and everyday products.

Abstract: Advanced fifth generation (5G) and beyond (B5G) communication networks have revolutionized wireless technologies, supporting ultra-high data rates, low latency, and massive connectivity. However, they also introduce vulnerabilities, particularly in decentralized Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments. Traditional cryptographic methods struggle with scalability and complexity, leading researchers to explore Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven physical layer techniques for secure communications. In this context, this paper focuses on the utilization of Machine and Deep Learning (ML/DL) techniques to tackle with the common problem of eavesdropping detection. To this end, a simulated industrial B5G heterogeneous wireless network is used to evaluate the performance of various ML/DL models, including Random Forests (RF), Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These models classify users as either legitimate or malicious ones based on channel state information (CSI), position data, and transmission power. According to the presented numerical results, DCNN and RF models achieve a detection accuracy approaching 100\% in identifying eavesdroppers with zero false alarms. In general, this work underlines the great potential of combining AI and Physical Layer Security (PLS) for next-generation wireless networks in order to address evolving security threats.

<title>Token Communication-Driven Multimodal Large Models in Resource-Constrained Multiuser Networks</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of intelligent applications at the wireless edge, alongside the exponential growth of multimodal data, poses challenges for deploying multimodal large models (MLMs) in resource-constrained networks. These constraints manifest as limited bandwidth, computational capacity, and stringent latency requirements, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a token communication paradigm that facilitates the decentralized deployment of MLMs across user devices and edge infrastructure (e.g., base stations). In this paradigm, task-relevant tokens are extracted from multimodal inputs and serve as the primary medium for communication between distributed model components. To align semantics and optimize transmission efficiency, we propose a dual-pronged approach: 1) We design a contrastive split fine-tuning method to project heterogeneous modalities into a shared feature space, enabling seamless interaction between model components while preserving modal-specific semantics. 2) We employ a lightweight compression technique to reduce the size of transmitted tokens, minimizing bandwidth consumption without sacrificing task-critical information. The proposed framework integrates collaborative fine-tuning of both the foundation model and multimodal transceivers, ensuring that token generation and utilization are tailored to specific downstream tasks. Simulation experiments conducted under different SNR conditions demonstrate that our method results in a $13.7\%$ improvement in test accuracy. Furthermore, our approach exhibits quicker convergence rates, even with reduced token lengths, highlighting the promise of token communication for facilitating more scalable and resilient MLM implementations in practical multiuser networks.

<title>PRISM: Complete Online Decentralized Multi-Agent Pathfinding with Rapid Information Sharing using Motion Constraints</title>

arXiv:2505.08025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Pathfinding with Rapid Information Sharing using Motion Constraints), a decentralized algorithm designed to address the multi-task multi-agent pathfinding (MT-MAPF) problem. PRISM enables large teams of agents to concurrently plan safe and efficient paths for multiple tasks while avoiding collisions. It employs a rapid communication strategy that uses information packets to exchange motion constraint information, enhancing cooperative pathfinding and situational awareness, even in scenarios without direct communication. We prove that PRISM resolves and avoids all deadlock scenarios when possible, a critical challenge in decentralized pathfinding. Empirically, we evaluate PRISM across five environments and 25 random scenarios, benchmarking it against the centralized Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and the decentralized Token Passing with Task Swaps (TPTS) algorithms. PRISM demonstrates scalability and solution quality, supporting 3.4 times more agents than CBS and handling up to 2.5 times more tasks in narrow passage environments than TPTS. Additionally, PRISM matches CBS in solution quality while achieving faster computation times, even under low-connectivity conditions. Its decentralized design reduces the computational burden on individual agents, making it scalable for large environments. These results confirm PRISM's robustness, scalability, and effectiveness in complex and dynamic pathfinding scenarios.

<title>FedRS-Bench: Realistic Federated Learning Datasets and Benchmarks in Remote Sensing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.08325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images are usually produced at an unprecedented scale, yet they are geographically and institutionally distributed, making centralized model training challenging due to data-sharing restrictions and privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized RS data sources without exposing raw data. However, there lacks a realistic federated dataset and benchmark in RS. Prior works typically rely on manually partitioned single dataset, which fail to capture the heterogeneity and scale of real-world RS data, and often use inconsistent experimental setups, hindering fair comparison. To address this gap, we propose a realistic federated RS dataset, termed FedRS. FedRS consists of eight datasets that cover various sensors and resolutions and builds 135 clients, which is representative of realistic operational scenarios. Data for each client come from the same source, exhibiting authentic federated properties such as skewed label distributions, imbalanced client data volumes, and domain heterogeneity across clients. These characteristics reflect practical challenges in federated RS and support evaluation of FL methods at scale. Based on FedRS, we implement 10 baseline FL algorithms and evaluation metrics to construct the comprehensive FedRS-Bench. The experimental results demonstrate that FL can consistently improve model performance over training on isolated data silos, while revealing performance trade-offs of different methods under varying client heterogeneity and availability conditions. We hope FedRS-Bench will accelerate research on large-scale, realistic FL in RS by providing a standardized, rich testbed and facilitating fair comparisons across future works. The source codes and dataset are available at https://fedrs-bench.github.io/.

Abstract: Coordinating time-sensitive deliveries in environments like hospitals poses a complex challenge, particularly when managing multiple online pickup and delivery requests within strict time windows using a team of heterogeneous robots. Traditional approaches fail to address dynamic rescheduling or diverse service requirements, typically restricting robots to single-task types. This paper tackles the Multi-Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (MPDPTW), where autonomous mobile robots are capable of handling varied service requests. The objective is to minimize late delivery penalties while maximizing task completion rates. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework leveraging a heterogeneous robot team and an efficient dynamic scheduling algorithm that supports dynamic task rescheduling. Users submit requests with specific time constraints, and our decentralized algorithm, Heterogeneous Mobile Robots Online Diverse Task Allocation (HMR-ODTA), optimizes task assignments to ensure timely service while addressing delays or task rejections. Extensive simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness. For smaller task sets (40-160 tasks), penalties were reduced by nearly 63%, while for larger sets (160-280 tasks), penalties decreased by approximately 50%. These results highlight the algorithm's effectiveness in improving task scheduling and coordination in multi-robot systems, offering a robust solution for enhancing delivery performance in structured, time-critical environments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.08542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart contract is a kind of self-executing code based on blockchain technology with a wide range of application scenarios, but the traditional generation method relies on manual coding and expert auditing, which has a high threshold and low efficiency. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in programming tasks, they still face challenges in smart contract generation w.r.t. effectiveness and security. To solve these problems, we propose FSM-SCG, a smart contract generation framework based on finite state machine (FSM) and LLMs, which significantly improves the quality of the generated code by abstracting user requirements to generate FSM, guiding LLMs to generate smart contracts, and iteratively optimizing the code with the feedback of compilation and security checks. The experimental results show that FSM-SCG significantly improves the quality of smart contract generation. Compared to the best baseline, FSM-SCG improves the compilation success rate of generated smart contract code by at most 48%, and reduces the average vulnerability risk score by approximately 68%.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed machine learning training while preserving privacy, representing a paradigm shift for data-sensitive and decentralized environments. Despite its rapid advancements, FL remains a complex and multifaceted field, requiring a structured understanding of its methodologies, challenges, and applications. In this survey, we introduce a meta-framework perspective, conceptualising FL as a composition of modular components that systematically address core aspects such as communication, optimisation, security, and privacy. We provide a historical contextualisation of FL, tracing its evolution from distributed optimisation to modern distributed learning paradigms. Additionally, we propose a novel taxonomy distinguishing Aggregation from Alignment, introducing the concept of alignment as a fundamental operator alongside aggregation. To bridge theory with practice, we explore available FL frameworks in Python, facilitating real-world implementation. Finally, we systematise key challenges across FL sub-fields, providing insights into open research questions throughout the meta-framework modules. By structuring FL within a meta-framework of modular components and emphasising the dual role of Aggregation and Alignment, this survey provides a holistic and adaptable foundation for understanding and advancing FL research and deployment.

Abstract: Blockchain is a type of decentralized distributed database. Unlike traditional relational database management systems, it does not require management or maintenance by a third party. All data management and update processes are open and transparent, solving the trust issues of centralized database management systems. Blockchain ensures network-wide consistency, consensus, traceability, and immutability. Under the premise of mutual distrust between nodes, blockchain technology integrates various technologies, such as P2P protocols, asymmetric encryption, consensus mechanisms, and chain structures. Data is distributed and stored across multiple nodes, maintained by all nodes, ensuring transaction data integrity, undeniability, and security. This facilitates trusted information sharing and supervision. The basic principles of blockchain form the foundation for all related research. Understanding the working principles is essential for further study of blockchain technology. There are many platforms based on blockchain technology, and they differ from one another. This paper will analyze the architecture of blockchain systems at each layer, focusing on the principles and technologies of blockchain platforms such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger Fabric. The analysis will cover their scalability and security and highlight their similarities, differences, advantages, and disadvantages.

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained traction in privacy-sensitive collaborative environments, with local SGD emerging as a key optimization method in decentralized settings. While its convergence properties are well-studied, asymptotic statistical guarantees beyond convergence remain limited. In this paper, we present two generalized Gaussian approximation results for local SGD and explore their implications. First, we prove a Berry-Esseen theorem for the final local SGD iterates, enabling valid multiplier bootstrap procedures. Second, motivated by robustness considerations, we introduce two distinct time-uniform Gaussian approximations for the entire trajectory of local SGD. The time-uniform approximations support Gaussian bootstrap-based tests for detecting adversarial attacks. Extensive simulations are provided to support our theoretical results.

<title>Is Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution Framework Centralized Enough for MARL?</title>

Abstract: Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has recently emerged as a popular framework for cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where agents can use additional global state information to guide training in a centralized way and make their own decisions only based on decentralized local policies. Despite the encouraging results achieved, CTDE makes an independence assumption on agent policies, which limits agents to adopt global cooperative information from each other during centralized training. Therefore, we argue that existing CTDE methods cannot fully utilize global information for training, leading to an inefficient joint-policy exploration and even suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce a novel Centralized Advising and Decentralized Pruning (CADP) framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning, that not only enables an efficacious message exchange among agents during training but also guarantees the independent policies for execution. Firstly, CADP endows agents the explicit communication channel to seek and take advices from different agents for more centralized training. To further ensure the decentralized execution, we propose a smooth model pruning mechanism to progressively constraint the agent communication into a closed one without degradation in agent cooperation capability. Empirical evaluations on StarCraft II micromanagement and Google Research Football benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Local Differential Privacy (LDP), a robust privacy-protection model, is widely adopted in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) due to its lightweight, decentralized, and scalable. However, its perturbation-based privacy-protection mechanism hinders distinguishing between any two data, thereby facilitating LDP poisoning attacks. The exposed physical-layer vulnerabilities and resource-constrained prevalent at the IIoT edge not only facilitate such attacks but also render existing LDP poisoning defenses, all of which are deployed at the edge and rely on ample resources, impractical.
  This work proposes a LDP poisoning defense for IIoT in the resource-rich aggregator. We first reveal key poisoning attack modes occurring within the LDP-utilized IIoT data-collection process, detailing how IIoT vulnerabilities enable attacks, and then formulate a general attack model and derive the poisoned data's indistinguishability. This work subsequently analyzes the poisoning impacts on aggregated data based on industrial process correlation, revealing the distortion of statistical query results' temporal similarity and the resulting disruption of inter-attribute correlation, and uncovering the intriguing paradox that adversaries' attempts to stabilize their poisoning actions for stealth are difficult to maintain. Given these findings, we propose PoisonCatcher, a solution for identifying poisoned data, which includes time-series detectors based on temporal similarity, attribute correlation, and pattern stability metrics to detect poisoned attributes, and a latent-bias feature miner for identifying poisons. Experiments on the real-world dataset indicate that PoisonCatcher successfully identifies poisoned data, demonstrating robust identification capabilities with F2 scores above 90.7\% under various attack settings.

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models and embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the intelligent transportation scenarios, the combination of them in intelligent transportation spawns the Vehicular Embodied AI Network (VEANs). In VEANs, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are typical agents whose local advanced AI applications are defined as vehicular embodied AI agents, enabling capabilities such as environment perception and multi-agent collaboration. Due to computation latency and resource constraints, the local AI applications and services running on vehicular embodied AI agents need to be migrated, and subsequently referred to as vehicular embodied AI agent twins, which drive the advancement of vehicular embodied AI networks to offload intensive tasks to Roadside Units (RSUs), mitigating latency problems while maintaining service quality. Recognizing workload imbalance among RSUs in traditional approaches, we model AV-RSU interactions as a Stackelberg game to optimize bandwidth resource allocation for efficient migration. A Tiny Multi-Agent Bidirectional LSTM Proximal Policy Optimization (TMABLPPO) algorithm is designed to approximate the Stackelberg equilibrium through decentralized coordination. Furthermore, a personalized neural network pruning algorithm based on Path eXclusion (PX) dynamically adapts to heterogeneous AV computation capabilities by identifying task-critical parameters in trained models, reducing model complexity with less performance degradation. Experimental validation confirms the algorithm's effectiveness in balancing system load and minimizing delays, demonstrating significant improvements in vehicular embodied AI agent deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, demonstrating strong capabilities in problem comprehension and reasoning. Inspired by these developments, researchers have begun exploring the use of LLMs as decentralized decision-makers for multi-robot formation control. However, prior studies reveal that directly applying LLMs to such tasks often leads to unstable and inconsistent behaviors, where robots may collapse to the centroid of their positions or diverge entirely due to hallucinated reasoning, logical inconsistencies, and limited coordination awareness. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that integrates LLMs with an influence-based plan consensus protocol. In this framework, each robot independently generates a local plan toward the desired formation using its own LLM. The robots then iteratively refine their plans through a decentralized consensus protocol that accounts for their influence on neighboring robots. This process drives the system toward a coherent and stable flocking formation in a fully decentralized manner. We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulations involving both state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs (e.g., o3-mini, Claude 3.5) and open-source models (e.g., Llama3.1-405b, Qwen-Max, DeepSeek-R1). The results show notable improvements in stability, convergence, and adaptability over previous LLM-based methods. We further validate our framework on a physical team of Crazyflie drones, demonstrating its practical viability and effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) proliferation brings important and pressing security and reliability issues that must be dealt with to guarantee public safety and help their widespread adoption. The contribution of the proposed research is towards achieving more secure, reliable, and trustworthy autonomous transportation system by providing more capabilities for anomaly detection, data provenance, and real-time response in safety critical AV deployments. In this research, we develop a new framework that combines the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for real-time anomaly detection with blockchain technology to detect and prevent any malicious activity including sensor failures in AVs. Through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, our approach continually monitors associated multi-sensor data streams to detect anomalous patterns that may represent cyberattacks as well as hardware malfunctions. Further, this framework employs a decentralized platform for securely storing sensor data and anomaly alerts in a blockchain ledger for data incorruptibility and authenticity, while offering transparent forensic features. Moreover, immediate automated response mechanisms are deployed using smart contracts when anomalies are found. This makes the AV system more resilient to attacks from both cyberspace and hardware component failure. Besides, we identify potential challenges of scalability in handling high frequency sensor data, computational constraint in resource constrained environment, and of distributed data storage in terms of privacy.

Leveraging the Gaussian DP (GDP) framework for privacy accounting, Dyn-D$^2$P dynamically adjusts gradient clipping bounds and noise levels based on gradient convergence. This proposed dynamic noise strategy enables us to enhance model accuracy while preserving the total privacy budget. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of Dyn-D$^2$P over its counterparts employing fixed-level noises, especially under strong privacy guarantees. Furthermore, we provide a provable utility bound for Dyn-D$^2$P that establishes an explicit dependency on network-related parameters, with a scaling factor of $1/\sqrt{n}$ in terms of the number of nodes $n$ up to a bias error term induced by gradient clipping. To our knowledge, this is the first model utility analysis for differentially private decentralized non-convex optimization with dynamic gradient clipping bounds and noise levels.

Abstract: Blockchain technology promises to democratize finance and promote social equity through decentralization, but questions remain about whether current implementations advance or hinder these goals. Through a mixed-methods study combining semi-structured interviews with 13 diverse blockchain stakeholders and analysis of over 3,000 cryptocurrency discussions on Reddit, we examine how trust manifests in cryptocurrency ecosystems despite their decentralized architecture. Our findings uncover that users actively seek out and create centralized trust anchors, such as established exchanges, prominent community figures, and recognized development teams, contradicting blockchain's fundamental promise of trustless interactions. We identify how this contradiction arises from users' mental need for accountability and their reluctance to shoulder the full responsibility of self-custody. The study also reveals how these centralized trust patterns disproportionately impact different user groups, with newer and less technical users showing stronger preferences for centralized intermediaries. This work contributes to our understanding of the inherent tensions between theoretical decentralization and practical implementation in cryptocurrency systems, highlighting the persistent role of centralized trust in supposedly trustless environments.

Abstract: Coded computing is one of the techniques that can be used for privacy protection in Federated Learning. However, most of the constructions used for coded computing work only under the assumption that the computations involved are exact, generally restricted to special classes of functions, and require quantized inputs. This paper considers the use of Private Berrut Approximate Coded Computing (PBACC) as a general solution to add strong but non-perfect privacy to federated learning. We derive new adapted PBACC algorithms for centralized aggregation, secure distributed training with centralized data, and secure decentralized training with decentralized data, thus enlarging significantly the applications of the method and the existing privacy protection tools available for these paradigms. Particularly, PBACC can be used robustly to attain privacy guarantees in decentralized federated learning for a variety of models. Our numerical results show that the achievable quality of different learning models (convolutional neural networks, variational autoencoders, and Cox regression) is minimally altered by using these new computing schemes, and that the privacy leakage can be bounded strictly to less than a fraction of one bit per participant. Additionally, the computational cost of the encoding and decoding processes depends only of the degree of decentralization of the data.

Abstract: Web3 grant programs are evolving mechanisms aimed at supporting innovation within the blockchain ecosystem, yet little is known on about their effectiveness. This paper proposes the concept of maturity to fill this gap and introduces the Grant Maturity Framework (GMF), a mixed-methods model for evaluating the maturity of Web3 grant programs. The GMF provides a systematic approach to assessing the structure, governance, and impact of Web3 grants, applied here to four prominent Ethereum layer-two (L2) grant programs: Arbitrum, Optimism, Mantle, and Taiko. By evaluating these programs using the GMF, the study categorizes them into four maturity stages, ranging from experimental to advanced. The findings reveal that Arbitrum's Long-Term Incentive Pilot Program (LTIPP) and Optimism's Mission Rounds show higher maturity, while Mantle and Taiko are still in their early stages. The research concludes by discussing the user-centric development of a Web3 grant management platform aimed at improving the maturity and effectiveness of Web3 grant management processes based on the findings from the GMF. This work contributes to both practical and theoretical knowledge on Web3 grant program evaluation and tooling, providing a valuable resource for Web3 grant operators and stakeholders.

<title>ContribChain: A Stress-Balanced Blockchain Sharding Protocol with Node Contribution Awareness</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.06899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing blockchain sharding protocols have focused on eliminating imbalanced workload distributions. However, even with workload balance, disparities in processing capabilities can lead to differential stress among shards, resulting in transaction backlogs in certain shards. Therefore, achieving stress balance among shards in the dynamic and heterogeneous environment presents a significant challenge of blockchain sharding. In this paper, we propose ContribChain, a blockchain sharding protocol that can automatically be aware of node contributions to achieve stress balance. We calculate node contribution values based on the historical behavior to evaluate the performance and security of nodes. Furthermore, we propose node allocation algorithm NACV and account allocation algorithm P-Louvain, which both match shard performance with workload to achieve stress balance. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to compare our work with state-of-the-art baselines based on real Ethereum transactions. The evaluation results show that P-Louvain reduces allocation execution time by 86% and the cross-shard transaction ratio by 7.5%. Meanwhile, ContribChain improves throughput by 35.8% and reduces the cross-shard transaction ratio by 16%.

Abstract: Recent progress in image-based medical disease detection encounters challenges such as limited annotated data sets, inadequate spatial feature analysis, data security issues, and inefficient training frameworks. This study introduces a data-efficient image transformer (DeIT)-based approach that overcomes these challenges by utilizing multiscale patch embedding for better feature extraction and stratified weighted random sampling to address class imbalance. The model also incorporates a LoRA-enhanced transformer encoder, a distillation framework, and federated learning for decentralized training, improving both efficiency and data security. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the highest AUC, F1 score, precision, minimal loss, and Top-5 accuracy. Additionally, Grad-CAM++ visualizations improve interpretability by highlighting critical pathological regions, enhancing the model's clinical relevance. These results highlight the potential of this approach to advance AI-powered medical imaging and disease detection.

<title>A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Cooperative Air-Ground-Human Crowdsensing in Emergency Rescue</title>

Abstract: Mobile crowdsensing is evolving beyond traditional human-centric models by integrating heterogeneous entities like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Optimizing task allocation among these diverse agents is critical, particularly in challenging emergency rescue scenarios characterized by complex environments, limited communication, and partial observability. This paper tackles the Heterogeneous-Entity Collaborative-Sensing Task Allocation (HECTA) problem specifically for emergency rescue, considering humans, UAVs, and UGVs. We introduce a novel ``Hard-Cooperative'' policy where UGVs prioritize recharging low-battery UAVs, alongside performing their sensing tasks. The primary objective is maximizing the task completion rate (TCR) under strict time constraints. We rigorously formulate this NP-hard problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) to effectively handle sequential decision-making under uncertainty. To solve this, we propose HECTA4ER, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm built upon a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution architecture. HECTA4ER incorporates tailored designs, including specialized modules for complex feature extraction, utilization of action-observation history via hidden states, and a mixing network integrating global and local information, specifically addressing the challenges of partial observability. Furthermore, theoretical analysis confirms the algorithm's convergence properties. Extensive simulations demonstrate that HECTA4ER significantly outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an average 18.42% increase in TCR. Crucially, a real-world case study validates the algorithm's effectiveness and robustness in dynamic sensing scenarios, highlighting its strong potential for practical application in emergency response.

arXiv:2505.07011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers random walk-based decentralized learning, where at each iteration of the learning process, one user updates the model and sends it to a randomly chosen neighbor until a convergence criterion is met. Preserving data privacy is a central concern and open problem in decentralized learning. We propose a privacy-preserving algorithm based on public-key cryptography and anonymization. In this algorithm, the user updates the model and encrypts the result using a distant user's public key. The encrypted result is then transmitted through the network with the goal of reaching that specific user. The key idea is to hide the source's identity so that, when the destination user decrypts the result, it does not know who the source was. The challenge is to design a network-dependent probability distribution (at the source) over the potential destinations such that, from the receiver's perspective, all users have a similar likelihood of being the source. We introduce the problem and construct a scheme that provides anonymity with theoretical guarantees. We focus on random regular graphs to establish rigorous guarantees.

Abstract: Decentralized stealth attack constructions that minimize the mutual information between the state variables and the measurements are proposed. The attack constructions are formulated as random Gaussian attacks targeting Cyber-physical systems that aims at minimizing the mutual information between the state variables and measurements while constraining the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of the measurements under attacks and the distribution of the measurements without attacks. The proposed information metrics adopted measure the disruption and attack detection both globally and locally. The decentralized attack constructions are formulated in a framework of normal games. The global and local information metrics yield games with global and local objectives in disruption and attack detection. We have proven the games are potential games and the convexity of the potential functions followed by the uniqueness and the achievability of the Nash Equilibrium, accordingly. We proposed a best response dynamics to achieve the Nash Equilibrium of the games. We numerically evaluate the performance of the proposed decentralized stealth random attacks on IEEE test systems and show it is feasible to exploit game theoretic techniques in decentralized attack constructions.

<title>AugMixCloak: A Defense against Membership Inference Attacks via Image Transformation</title>

Abstract: Traditional machine learning (ML) raises serious privacy concerns, while federated learning (FL) mitigates the risk of data leakage by keeping data on local devices. However, the training process of FL can still leak sensitive information, which adversaries may exploit to infer private data. One of the most prominent threats is the membership inference attack (MIA), where the adversary aims to determine whether a particular data record was part of the training set.
  This paper addresses this problem through a two-stage defense called AugMixCloak. The core idea is to apply data augmentation and principal component analysis (PCA)-based information fusion to query images, which are detected by perceptual hashing (pHash) as either identical to or highly similar to images in the training set. Experimental results show that AugMixCloak successfully defends against both binary classifier-based MIA and metric-based MIA across five datasets and various decentralized FL (DFL) topologies. Compared with regularization-based defenses, AugMixCloak demonstrates stronger protection. Compared with confidence score masking, AugMixCloak exhibits better generalization.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising framework for collaboratively training machine learning models across decentralized genomic datasets without direct data sharing. While this approach preserves data locality, it remains susceptible to sophisticated inference attacks that can compromise individual privacy. In this study, we simulate a federated learning setup using synthetic genomic data and assess its vulnerability to three key attack vectors: Membership Inference Attack (MIA), Gradient-Based Membership Inference Attack, and Label Inference Attack (LIA). Our experiments reveal that Gradient-Based MIA achieves the highest effectiveness, with a precision of 0.79 and F1-score of 0.87, underscoring the risk posed by gradient exposure in federated updates. Additionally, we visualize comparative attack performance through radar plots and quantify model leakage across clients. The findings emphasize the inadequacy of na\"ive FL setups in safeguarding genomic privacy and motivate the development of more robust privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored to the unique sensitivity of genomic data.

Abstract: We introduce INTELLECT-2, the first globally distributed reinforcement learning (RL) training run of a 32 billion parameter language model. Unlike traditional centralized training efforts, INTELLECT-2 trains a reasoning model using fully asynchronous RL across a dynamic, heterogeneous swarm of permissionless compute contributors.
  To enable a training run with this unique infrastructure, we built various components from scratch: we introduce PRIME-RL, our training framework purpose-built for distributed asynchronous reinforcement learning, based on top of novel components such as TOPLOC, which verifies rollouts from untrusted inference workers, and SHARDCAST, which efficiently broadcasts policy weights from training nodes to inference workers.
  Beyond infrastructure components, we propose modifications to the standard GRPO training recipe and data filtering techniques that were crucial to achieve training stability and ensure that our model successfully learned its training objective, thus improving upon QwQ-32B, the state of the art reasoning model in the 32B parameter range.
  We open-source INTELLECT-2 along with all of our code and data, hoping to encourage and enable more open research in the field of decentralized training.

Abstract: Centralized search engines control what we see, read, believe, and vote. Consequently, they raise concerns over information control, censorship, and bias. Decentralized search engines offer a remedy to this problem, but their adoption has been hindered by their inferior quality and lack of a self-sustaining economic framework. We present SwarmSearch, a fully decentralized, AI-powered search engine with a self-funding architecture. Our system is designed for deployment within the decentralized file-sharing software Tribler. SwarmSearch integrates volunteer-based with profit-driven mechanisms to foster an implicit marketplace for resources. Employing the state-of-the-art of AI-based retrieval and relevance ranking, we also aim to close the quality gap between decentralized search and centralized alternatives. Our system demonstrates high retrieval accuracy while showing robustness in the presence of 50% adversarial nodes.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has become an effective and widely used approach to training deep learning models on decentralized datasets held by distinct clients. FL also strengthens both security and privacy protections for training data. Common challenges associated with statistical heterogeneity between distributed datasets have spurred significant interest in personalized FL (pFL) methods, where models combine aspects of global learning with local modeling specific to each client's unique characteristics. In this work, the efficacy of theoretically supported, adaptive MMD measures within the Ditto framework, a state-of-the-art technique in pFL, are investigated. The use of such measures significantly improves model performance across a variety of tasks, especially those with pronounced feature heterogeneity. While the Ditto algorithm is specifically considered, such measures are directly applicable to a number of other pFL settings, and the results motivate the use of constraints tailored to the various kinds of heterogeneity expected in FL systems.

Abstract: Randomness plays a vital role in numerous applications, including simulation, cryptography, distributed systems, and gaming. Consequently, extensive research has been conducted to generate randomness. One such method is to design a decentralized random number generator (DRNG), a protocol that enables multiple participants to collaboratively generate random outputs that must be publicly verifiable. However, existing DRNGs are either not secure against quantum computers or depend on the random oracle model (ROM) to achieve security. In this paper, we design a DRNG based on lattice-based publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) that is post-quantum secure and proven secure in the standard model. Additionally, our DRNG requires only two rounds of communication to generate a single (pseudo)random value and can tolerate up to any t < n/2 dishonest participants. To our knowledge, the proposed DRNG construction is the first to achieve all these properties.

Abstract: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), as a simple yet powerful model, continues to be widely used in classification and regression tasks. However, traditional MLPs often struggle to efficiently capture nonlinear relationships in load data when dealing with complex datasets. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, have shown promising capabilities in modeling complex nonlinear relationships. In this study, we explore the performance of KANs within federated learning (FL) frameworks and compare them to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons. Our experiments, conducted across four diverse datasets demonstrate that KANs consistently outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy, stability, and convergence efficiency. KANs exhibit remarkable robustness under varying client numbers and non-IID data distributions, maintaining superior performance even as client heterogeneity increases. Notably, KANs require fewer communication rounds to converge compared to MLPs, highlighting their efficiency in FL scenarios. Additionally, we evaluate multiple parameter aggregation strategies, with trimmed mean and FedProx emerging as the most effective for optimizing KAN performance. These findings establish KANs as a robust and scalable alternative to MLPs for federated learning tasks, paving the way for their application in decentralized and privacy-preserving environments.

<title>Routing Attacks in Ethereum PoS: A Systematic Exploration</title>

Abstract: With the promise of greater decentralization and sustainability, Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The new consensus protocol introduces novel vulnerabilities that warrant further investigation. The goal of this paper is to investigate the security of Ethereum's PoS system from an Internet routing perspective.
  To this end, this paper makes two contributions: First, we devise a novel framework for inferring the distribution of validators on the Internet without disturbing the real network. Second, we introduce a class of network-level attacks on Ethereum's PoS system that jointly exploit Internet routing vulnerabilities with the protocol's reward and penalty mechanisms. We describe two representative attacks: StakeBleed, where the attacker triggers an inactivity leak, halting block finality and causing financial losses for all validators; and KnockBlock, where the attacker increases her expected MEV gains by preventing targeted blocks from being included in the chain. We find that both attacks are practical and effective. An attacker executing StakeBleed can inflict losses of almost 300 ETH in just 2 hours by hijacking as few as 30 IP prefixes. An attacker implementing KnockBlock could increase their MEV expected gains by 44.5% while hijacking a single prefix for less than 2 minutes.
  Our paper serves as a call to action for validators to reinforce their Internet routing infrastructure and for the Ethereum P2P protocol to implement stronger mechanisms to conceal validator locations.

Abstract: The integration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into the existing transportation infrastructure offers a promising solution to alleviate congestion and enhance mobility. This research explores a novel approach to traffic optimization by employing a multi-agent rollout approach within a mixed autonomy environment. The study concentrates on coordinating the speed of human-driven vehicles by longitudinally controlling AVs, aiming to dynamically optimize traffic flow and alleviate congestion at highway bottlenecks in real-time. We model the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and propose an improved multi-agent rollout algorithm. By employing agent-by-agent policy iterations, our approach implicitly considers cooperation among multiple agents and seamlessly adapts to complex scenarios where the number of agents dynamically varies. Validated in a real-world network with varying AV penetration rates and traffic flow, the simulations demonstrate that the multi-agent rollout algorithm significantly enhances performance, reducing average travel time on bottleneck segments by 9.42% with a 10% AV penetration rate.

Abstract: This paper introduces a decentralized estimator-based safety-critical controller designed for formation control of non-holonomic mobile robots operating in communication-constrained environments. The proposed framework integrates a robust state estimator capable of accurately reconstructing neighboring agents' velocity vectors and orientations under varying dynamic conditions, with a decentralized formation tracking controller that leverages Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee collision avoidance and inter-agent safety. We present a closed-form control law that ensures both stability and string stability, effectively attenuating disturbances propagating from leader to followers. The theoretical foundations of the estimator and controller are established using Lyapunov stability analysis, which confirms global asymptotic stability under constant velocities and global uniformly ultimate boundedness under time-varying conditions. Extensive numerical simulations and realistic Gazebo-based experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and practical applicability of the proposed method, demonstrating precise formation tracking, stringent safety maintenance, and disturbance resilience without relying on inter-robot communication.

Abstract: The concept of distributed consensus originated in the 1970s and gained widespread attention following Leslie Lamport's influential publication on the Byzantine Generals Problem in the 1980s. Over the past five decades, distributed consensus has become an extensively researched field. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) has emerged as a prominent and widely adopted solution due to its conceptual clarity, effectiveness, and resilience to arbitrary failures. However, PBFT does not universally address all scenarios, highlighting the necessity of developing a comprehensive understanding of the history, evolution, and foundational principles of distributed consensus. This article systematically reviews the historical evolution and foundational principles of distributed consensus, examining pivotal advancements including fault-tolerant state machine replication (SMR), consensus protocols in partially synchronous and asynchronous networks, and recent innovations in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based consensus mechanisms. We further analyse the core design rationales, essential components, and underlying primitives across various distributed fault-tolerant protocols. The relationship between BFT consensus mechanisms and their applications in environments requiring robust resilience against adversarial faults is also explored. Finally, we discuss emerging research areas and challenges, such as consensus for wireless and blockchain scenarios, highlighting potential future developments. This comprehensive overview offers valuable insights to inform the design, optimisation, and implementation of distributed consensus systems across multiple application scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing congestion of Earth's orbit due to growing satellite deployments and space debris poses a significant challenge to sustainable space operations. Traditional space surveillance systems rely on centralized architectures, which introduce single points of failure and scalability constraints. This paper proposes a blockchain-based solution where satellites function as nodes with distinct roles to validate and securely store debris-tracking data. Simulation results indicate that optimal network performance is achieved with approximately 30 nodes, balancing throughput and response time, representing an approximately 9x improvement over traditional consensus mechanisms.

Abstract: Microgrids have emerged as a pivotal solution in the quest for a sustainable and energy-efficient future. While microgrids offer numerous advantages, they are also prone to issues related to reliably forecasting renewable energy demand and production, protecting against cyberattacks, controlling operational costs, optimizing power flow, and regulating the performance of energy management systems (EMS). Tackling these energy management challenges is essential to facilitate microgrid applications and seamlessly incorporate renewable energy resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently demonstrated immense potential for optimizing energy management in microgrids, providing efficient and reliable solutions. This paper highlights the combined benefits of enabling AI-based methodologies in the energy management systems of microgrids by examining the applicability and efficiency of AI-based EMS in achieving specific technical and economic objectives. The paper also points out several future research directions that promise to spearhead AI-driven EMS, namely the development of self-healing microgrids, integration with blockchain technology, use of Internet of things (IoT), and addressing interpretability, data privacy, scalability, and the prospects to generative AI in the context of future AI-based EMS.

<title>PRIMG : Efficient LLM-driven Test Generation Using Mutant Prioritization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05584</link>

Abstract: Mutation testing is a widely recognized technique for assessing and enhancing the effectiveness of software test suites by introducing deliberate code mutations. However, its application often results in overly large test suites, as developers generate numerous tests to kill specific mutants, increasing computational overhead. This paper introduces PRIMG (Prioritization and Refinement Integrated Mutation-driven Generation), a novel framework for incremental and adaptive test case generation for Solidity smart contracts. PRIMG integrates two core components: a mutation prioritization module, which employs a machine learning model trained on mutant subsumption graphs to predict the usefulness of surviving mutants, and a test case generation module, which utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and iteratively refine test cases to achieve syntactic and behavioral correctness.
  We evaluated PRIMG on real-world Solidity projects from Code4Arena to assess its effectiveness in improving mutation scores and generating high-quality test cases. The experimental results demonstrate that PRIMG significantly reduces test suite size while maintaining high mutation coverage. The prioritization module consistently outperformed random mutant selection, enabling the generation of high-impact tests with reduced computational effort. Furthermore, the refining process enhanced the correctness and utility of LLM-generated tests, addressing their inherent limitations in handling edge cases and complex program logic.

<title>Exploring the Susceptibility to Fraud of Monetary Incentive Mechanisms for Strengthening FOSS Projects</title>

Abstract: Free and open source software (FOSS) is ubiquitous on modern IT systems, accelerating the speed of software engineering over the past decades. With its increasing importance and historical reliance on uncompensated contributions, questions have been raised regarding the continuous maintenance of FOSS and its implications from a security perspective. In recent years, different funding programs have emerged to provide external incentives to reinforce community FOSS' sustainability. Past research primarily focused on analyses what type of projects have been funded and for what reasons. However, it has neither been considered whether there is a need for such external incentives, nor whether the incentive mechanisms, especially with the development of decentralized approaches, are susceptible to fraud. In this study, we explore the need for funding through a literature review and compare the susceptibility to fraud of centralized and decentralized incentive programs by performing case studies on the Sovereign Tech Fund (STF) and the tea project. We find non-commercial incentives to fill an important gap, ensuring longevity and sustainability of projects. Furthermore, we find the STF to be able to achieve a high resilience against fraud attempts, while tea is highly susceptible to fraud, as evidenced by revelation of an associated sybil attack on npm. Our results imply that special considerations must be taken into account when utilizing quantitative repository metrics regardless whether spoofing is expected.

<title>Offline Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning via Score Decomposition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.05968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces critical challenges due to distributional shifts, further exacerbated by the high dimensionality of joint action spaces and the diversity in coordination strategies and quality among agents. Conventional approaches, including independent learning frameworks and value decomposition methods based on pessimistic principles, remain susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) joint actions and often yield suboptimal performance. Through systematic analysis of prevalent offline MARL benchmarks, we identify that this limitation primarily stems from the inherently multimodal nature of joint collaborative policies induced by offline data collection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework: First, we employ a diffusion-based generative model to explicitly capture the complex behavior policy, enabling accurate modeling of diverse multi-agent coordination patterns. Second, we introduce a sequential score function decomposition mechanism to regularize individual policies and enable decentralized execution. Extensive experiments on continuous control tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple standard offline MARL benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by 26.3\% in normalized returns. Our approach provides new insights into offline coordination and equilibrium selection in cooperative multi-agent systems.

<title>A Context-Driven Approach for Co-Auditing Smart Contracts with The Support of GPT-4 code interpreter</title>

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of smart contracts necessitates rigorous auditing to ensure their security and reliability. Manual auditing, although comprehensive, is time-consuming and heavily reliant on the auditor's expertise. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging them to assist auditors in the auditing process (co-auditing). However, the effectiveness of LLMs in smart contract co-auditing is contingent upon the design of the input prompts, especially in terms of context description and code length. This paper introduces a novel context-driven prompting technique for smart contract co-auditing. Our approach employs three techniques for context scoping and augmentation, encompassing code scoping to chunk long code into self-contained code segments based on code inter-dependencies, assessment scoping to enhance context description based on the target assessment goal, thereby limiting the search space, and reporting scoping to force a specific format for the generated response. Through empirical evaluations on publicly available vulnerable contracts, our method demonstrated a detection rate of 96\% for vulnerable functions, outperforming the native prompting approach, which detected only 53\%. To assess the reliability of our prompting approach, manual analysis of the results was conducted by expert auditors from our partner, Quantstamp, a world-leading smart contract auditing company. The experts' analysis indicates that, in unlabeled datasets, our proposed approach enhances the proficiency of the GPT-4 code interpreter in detecting vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising paradigm for training Large Language Models (LLMs) in a decentralized manner while preserving data privacy and minimizing communication overhead. This survey examines recent advancements in FL-driven LLMs, with a particular emphasis on architectural designs, performance optimization, and security concerns, including the emerging area of machine unlearning. In this context, machine unlearning refers to the systematic removal of specific data contributions from trained models to comply with privacy regulations such as the Right to be Forgotten. We review a range of strategies enabling unlearning in federated LLMs, including perturbation-based methods, model decomposition, and incremental retraining, while evaluating their trade-offs in terms of efficiency, privacy guarantees, and model utility. Through selected case studies and empirical evaluations, we analyze how these methods perform in practical FL scenarios. This survey identifies critical research directions toward developing secure, adaptable, and high-performing federated LLM systems for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Mining attacks enable an adversary to procure a disproportionately large portion of mining rewards by deviating from honest mining practices within the PoW-based blockchain system. In this paper, we demonstrate that the security vulnerabilities of PoW-based blockchain extend beyond what these mining attacks initially reveal. We introduce a novel mining strategy, named BM-PAW, which yields superior rewards for both the attacker and the targeted pool compared to the state-of-the-art mining attack, PAW. BM-PAW attackers are incentivized to offer appropriate bribe money to other targets, as they comply with the attacker's directives upon receiving payment. We further find the BM-PAW attacker can circumvent the miner's dilemma through equilibrium analysis in a two-pool BM-PAW game scenario, wherein the outcome is determined by the attacker's mining power. We finally propose practical countermeasures to mitigate these novel pool attacks.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the decentralized stochastic subgradient-based methods in minimizing nonsmooth nonconvex functions without Clarke regularity, especially in the decentralized training of nonsmooth neural networks. We propose a general framework that unifies various decentralized subgradient-based methods, such as decentralized stochastic subgradient descent (DSGD), DSGD with gradient-tracking technique (DSGD-T), and DSGD with momentum (DSGD-M). To establish the convergence properties of our proposed framework, we relate the discrete iterates to the trajectories of a continuous-time differential inclusion, which is assumed to have a coercive Lyapunov function with a stable set $\mathcal{A}$. We prove the asymptotic convergence of the iterates to the stable set $\mathcal{A}$ with sufficiently small and diminishing step-sizes. These results provide first convergence guarantees for some well-recognized of decentralized stochastic subgradient-based methods without Clarke regularity of the objective function. Preliminary numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework yields highly efficient decentralized stochastic subgradient-based methods with convergence guarantees in the training of nonsmooth neural networks.

Abstract: We present a geometric neural network-based tracking controller for systems evolving on matrix Lie groups under unknown dynamics, actuator faults, and bounded disturbances. Leveraging the left-invariance of the tangent bundle of matrix Lie groups, viewed as an embedded submanifold of the vector space $\R^{N\times N}$, we propose a set of learning rules for neural network weights that are intrinsically compatible with the Lie group structure and do not require explicit parameterization. Exploiting the geometric properties of Lie groups, this approach circumvents parameterization singularities and enables a global search for optimal weights. The ultimate boundedness of all error signals -- including the neural network weights, the coordinate-free configuration error function, and the tracking velocity error -- is established using Lyapunov's direct method. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we provide illustrative simulation results for decentralized formation control of multi-agent systems on the Special Euclidean group.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) in cyber physical systems (CPS) is a complex task due to the challenges that arise in terms of real-time decision making, safety, reliability, device heterogeneity, and data privacy. There are also open research questions that must be addressed in order to fully realize the potential of ML in CPS. Federated learning (FL), a distributed approach to ML, has become increasingly popular in recent years. It allows models to be trained using data from decentralized sources. This approach has been gaining popularity in the CPS field, as it integrates computer, communication, and physical processes. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the most recent developments of FL-CPS, including the numerous application areas, system topologies, and algorithms developed in recent years. The paper starts by discussing recent advances in both FL and CPS, followed by their integration. Then, the paper compares the application of FL in CPS with its applications in the internet of things (IoT) in further depth to show their connections and distinctions. Furthermore, the article scrutinizes how FL is utilized in critical CPS applications, e.g., intelligent transportation systems, cybersecurity services, smart cities, and smart healthcare solutions. The study also includes critical insights and lessons learned from various FL-CPS implementations. The paper's concluding section delves into significant concerns and suggests avenues for further research in this fast-paced and dynamic era.

Abstract: Blockchain technology, introduced in 2008, has revolutionized data storage and transfer across sectors such as finance, healthcare, intelligent transportation, and the metaverse. However, the proliferation of blockchain systems has led to discrepancies in architectures, consensus mechanisms, and data standards, creating data and value silos that hinder the development of an integrated multi chain ecosystem. Blockchain interoperability (a.k.a cross chain interoperability) has thus emerged as a solution to enable seamless data and asset exchange across disparate blockchains. In this survey, we systematically analyze over 150 high impact sources from academic journals, digital libraries, and grey literature to provide an in depth examination of blockchain interoperability. By exploring the existing methods, technologies, and architectures, we offer a classification of interoperability approaches including Atomic Swaps, Sidechains, Light Clients, and so on, which represent the most comprehensive overview to date. Furthermore, we investigate the convergence of academic research with industry practices, underscoring the importance of collaborative efforts in advancing blockchain innovation. Finally, we identify key strategic insights, challenges, and future research trajectories in this field. Our findings aim to support researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders in understanding and harnessing the transformative potential of blockchain interoperability to address current challenges and drive forward a cohesive multi-chain ecosystem.

Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a disruptive technology, offering unprecedented degrees of freedom (DoF) for wireless communication systems. However, optimizing fluid antenna (FA) positions entails significant computational costs, especially when the number of FAs is large. To address this challenge, we introduce a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) architecture to FAS, which partitions the FA array into clusters and enables parallel processing. Based on the DBP architecture, we formulate a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem through joint beamforming and FA position design for FA-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. To solve the WSR maximization problem, we propose a novel decentralized block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based algorithm that leverages matrix fractional programming (FP) and majorization-minimization (MM) methods. The proposed decentralized algorithm achieves low computational, communication, and storage costs, thus unleashing the potential of the DBP architecture. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm under the DBP architecture reduces computational time by over 70% compared to centralized architectures with negligible WSR performance loss.

Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that enables the collaborative training of multiple clients through centralized model aggregation. However, standard federated learning relies on a centralized server, making it vulnerable to server failures. While existing solutions utilize blockchain technology to implement Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL), the statistical heterogeneity of data distributions among clients severely degrades the DFL's performance. Driven by this issue, this paper proposes a decentralized federated prototype learning framework, named DFPL, which significantly improves the performance of distributed machine learning across heterogeneous data distributions. Specifically, our framework introduces prototype learning into DFL to address statistical heterogeneity, which greatly reduces the number of parameters exchanged between clients. Additionally, blockchain is embedded into our framework, enabling the training and mining processes to be implemented at each client. From a theoretical perspective, we provide convergence guarantee of DFPL by combining resource allocation for training and mining. The experiments highlight the superiority of our DFPL framework in communication efficiency and test performance across three benchmark datasets with heterogeneous data distributions.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework that preserves data privacy while enabling collaborative model training across distributed clients. However, FL faces significant challenges due to limited communication resources, statistical heterogeneity, and the need for balanced client participation. This paper proposes an Age of Information (AoI)-based client selection policy that addresses these challenges by minimizing load imbalance through controlled selection intervals. Our method employs a decentralized Markov scheduling policy, allowing clients to independently manage participation based on age-dependent selection probabilities, which balances client updates across training rounds with minimal central oversight. We provide a convergence proof for our method, demonstrating that it ensures stable and efficient model convergence. Specifically, we derive optimal parameters for the Markov selection model to achieve balanced and consistent client participation, highlighting the benefits of AoI in enhancing convergence stability. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our AoI-based method, particularly the optimal Markov variant, improves convergence over the FedAvg selection approach across both IID and non-IID data settings by $7.5\%$ and up to $20\%$. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of AoI-based scheduling for scalable, fair, and efficient FL systems across diverse learning environments.

Abstract: The intersection of blockchain (distributed ledger) and identity management lacks a comprehensive framework for classifying distributed-ledger-based identity solutions. This paper introduces a methodologically developed taxonomy derived from the analysis of 390 scientific papers and expert discussions.
  The resulting framework consists of 22 dimensions with 113 characteristics, organized into three groups: trust anchor implementations, identity architectures (identifiers and credentials), and ledger specifications. This taxonomy facilitates the systematic analysis, comparison, and design of distributed-ledger-based identity solutions, as demonstrated through its application to two distinct architectures.
  As the first methodology-driven taxonomy in this field, this work advances standardization and enhances understanding of distributed-ledger-based identity architectures. It provides researchers and practitioners with a structured framework for evaluating design decisions and implementation approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications. However, individual LLMs often produce inconsistent, biased, or hallucinated outputs due to limitations in their training corpora and model architectures. Recently, collaborative frameworks such as the Multi-LLM Network (MultiLLMN) have been introduced, enabling multiple LLMs to interact and jointly respond to user queries. Nevertheless, MultiLLMN architectures raise critical concerns regarding the reliability and security of the generated content, particularly in open environments where malicious or compromised LLMs may be present. Moreover, reliance on centralized coordination undermines system efficiency and introduces single points of failure. In this paper, we propose a novel Trusted MultiLLMN framework, driven by a Weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerance (WBFT) blockchain consensus mechanism, to ensure the reliability, security, and efficiency of multi-LLM collaboration. In WBFT, voting weights are adaptively assigned to each LLM based on its response quality and trustworthiness, incentivizing reliable behavior, and reducing the impact of malicious nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that WBFT significantly improves both consensus security and efficiency compared to classical and modern consensus mechanisms, particularly under wireless network conditions. Furthermore, our evaluations reveal that Trusted MultiLLMN supported by WBFT can deliver higher-quality and more credible responses than both single LLMs and conventional MultiLLMNs, thereby providing a promising path toward building robust, decentralized AI collaboration networks.

Abstract: Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), have exhibited remarkable zero-shot performance across various image classification tasks. Fine-tuning these models on domain-specific datasets further enhances their effectiveness for downstream applications. However, fine-tuning in cloud environments raises significant concerns regarding data security and privacy. Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution by enabling model training across local clients without centralizing sensitive data, but the high communication and computation costs of transmitting full pre-trained models during training limit its scalability. Additionally, non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across local clients can negatively impact model convergence and performance. To address these challenges, we propose CacheFL, a novel federated learning method that replaces traditional full model fine-tuning with lightweight cache model fine-tuning. The cache model is initialized using a class-balanced dataset generated by a generative pre-trained model, effectively mitigating the impact of non-IID data. This cache model is then distributed to local clients for fine-tuning, and the updated parameters from each client are aggregated on the server and redistributed. With the updated cache model, the classification performance of CLIP is improved after just a few epochs. By limiting the training and communication to the cache model, CacheFL significantly reduces resource demands while ensuring data privacy and security. Extensive experiments conducted on ImageNet and 10 additional datasets demonstrate that CacheFL outperforms traditional approaches in terms of classification accuracy, resource efficiency, and privacy preservation.

Abstract: Max-pressure (MP) control has emerged as a prominent real-time network traffic signal control strategy due to its simplicity, decentralized structure, and theoretical guarantees of network queue stability. Meanwhile, advances in connected vehicle (CV) technology have sparked extensive research into CV-based traffic signal control. Despite these developments, few studies have investigated MP control in heterogeneously distributed and partially CV environments while ensuring network queue stability. To address these research gaps, we propose a CV-based MP control (CV-MP) method that leverages real-time CV travel time information to compute the pressure, thereby incorporating both the spatial distribution and temporal delays of vehicles, unlike existing approaches that utilized only spatial distribution or temporal delays. In particular, we establish sufficient conditions for road network queue stability that are compatible with most existing MP control methods. Moreover, we pioneered the proof of network queue stability even if the vehicles are only partially connected and heterogeneously distributed, and gave a necessary condition of CV observation for maintaining the stability. Evaluation results on an Amsterdam corridor show that CV-MP significantly reduces vehicle delays compared to both actuated control and conventional MP control across various CV penetration rates. Moreover, in scenarios with dynamic traffic demand, CV-MP achieves lower spillover peaks even with low and heterogeneous CV penetration rates, further highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: We introduce two advanced attack strategies, the Unrestricted Uncle Maker (UUM) Attack and the Staircase-Unrestricted Uncle Maker (SUUM) Attack, which fundamentally threaten the security of timestamp-based Nakamoto-style blockchains by inflicting permanent systemic harm. Unlike prior work that merely enhances adversarial rewards, these attacks exploit vulnerabilities in timestamp manipulation and fork selection rules to irreversibly destabilize blockchain fairness and incentive mechanisms. Specifically, the SUUM attack enables adversaries to persistently launch attacks at zero cost, eliminating constraints on block withholding and risk-free conditions, while systematically maximizing rewards through coordinated timestamp adjustments and strategic block release.
  Our analysis demonstrates that SUUM adversaries achieve disproportionate reward advantages over both UUM and the original Riskless Uncle Maker (RUM) Attack [CCS '23], with all three strategies surpassing honest mining. Crucially, SUUM's cost-free persistence allows adversaries to indefinitely drain rewards from honest participants by maintaining minimal difficulty risks through precise timestamp manipulation. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle: adversaries amplify their profits while suppressing honest returns, thereby permanently eroding the protocol's security assumptions. Through rigorous theoretical modeling and simulations, we validate how SUUM's combination of timestamp tampering, block withholding, and difficulty risk control enables unmitigated exploitation of consensus mechanisms. This work underscores the existential risks posed by timestamp-based Nakamoto-style protocols and advocates urgent countermeasures to ensure long-term stability.

<title>Empirical Analysis of Transaction Conflicts in Ethereum and Solana for Parallel Execution</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of historical data across two popular blockchain networks: Ethereum and Solana. Our study focuses on two key aspects: transaction conflicts and the maximum theoretical parallelism within historical blocks. We aim to quantify the degree of transaction parallelism and assess how effectively it can be exploited by systematically examining block-level characteristics, both within individual blocks and across different historical periods. In particular, this study is the first of its kind to leverage historical transactional workloads to evaluate transactional conflict patterns. By offering a structured approach to analyzing these conflicts, our research provides valuable insights and an empirical basis for developing more efficient parallel execution techniques in the Ethereum and Solana Virtual Machines. Our empirical analysis reveals that Ethereum blocks frequently achieve high independence$-$over 50\% in more than 50\% of blocks, while Solana blocks contain longer conflict chains, comprising $\sim$59\% of the block size compared to $\sim$18\% in Ethereum, reflecting fundamentally different parallel execution dynamics.

<title>Walrus: An Efficient Decentralized Storage Network</title>

Abstract: Decentralized storage systems face a fundamental trade-off between replication overhead, recovery efficiency, and security guarantees. Current approaches either rely on full replication, incurring substantial storage costs, or employ trivial erasure coding schemes that struggle with efficient recovery especially under high storage-node churn. We present Walrus, a novel decentralized blob storage system that addresses these limitations through multiple technical innovations. At the core of Walrus is RedStuff, a two-dimensional erasure coding protocol that achieves high security with only 4.5x replication factor, while enabling self-healing recovery that requires bandwidth proportional to only the lost data $(O(|blob|/n)$ versus $O(|blob|)$ in traditional systems). Crucially, RedStuff is the first protocol to support storage challenges in asynchronous networks, preventing adversaries from exploiting network delays to pass verification without actually storing data. Walrus also introduces a novel multi-stage epoch change protocol that efficiently handles storage node churn while maintaining uninterrupted availability during committee transitions. Our system incorporates authenticated data structures to defend against malicious clients and ensures data consistency throughout storage and retrieval processes. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that Walrus achieves practical performance at scale, making it suitable for a wide range of decentralized applications requiring high-integrity, available blob storage with reasonable overhead.
