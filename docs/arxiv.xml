<div> 关键词：椭圆曲线密码学（ECC）、GPU优化、gECC框架、高性能、并行计算

总结:
本文介绍了针对GPU架构优化的高吞吐量椭圆曲线加密算法框架gECC。gECC通过批量执行椭圆曲线操作和微架构层面的模数运算优化，利用Montgomery's trick实现批量EC计算，并采用创新的并行计算与内存管理技术，最大限度提高并行计算效率并降低GPU全局内存访问开销。通过对模乘运算瓶颈的分析，发现其效率高度依赖于Integer Multiply-Add (IMAD)指令的数量。为解决这一问题，文章提出了利用判定点寄存器传递进位信息以及使用加减法指令(IADD3)替代IMAD指令的技术。实验结果显示，相较于现有最先进的GPU基线系统，gECC在ECDSA和ECDH上的性能分别提高了5.56倍和4.94倍；在实际区块链应用中，相比于最先进的CPU基线系统，实现了1.56倍的性能提升。 <div>

Abstract: Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an encryption method that provides security comparable to traditional techniques like Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) but with lower computational complexity and smaller key sizes, making it a competitive option for applications such as blockchain, secure multi-party computation, and database security. However, the throughput of ECC is still hindered by the significant performance overhead associated with elliptic curve (EC) operations. This paper presents gECC, a versatile framework for ECC optimized for GPU architectures, specifically engineered to achieve high-throughput performance in EC operations. gECC incorporates batch-based execution of EC operations and microarchitecture-level optimization of modular arithmetic. It employs Montgomery's trick to enable batch EC computation and incorporates novel computation parallelization and memory management techniques to maximize the computation parallelism and minimize the access overhead of GPU global memory. Also, we analyze the primary bottleneck in modular multiplication by investigating how the user codes of modular multiplication are compiled into hardware instructions and what these instructions' issuance rates are. We identify that the efficiency of modular multiplication is highly dependent on the number of Integer Multiply-Add (IMAD) instructions. To eliminate this bottleneck, we propose techniques to minimize the number of IMAD instructions by leveraging predicate registers to pass the carry information and using addition and subtraction instructions (IADD3) to replace IMAD instructions. Our results show that, for ECDSA and ECDH, gECC can achieve performance improvements of 5.56x and 4.94x, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art GPU-based system. In a real-world blockchain application, we can achieve performance improvements of 1.56x, compared to the state-of-the-art CPU-based system.

Abstract: Lithology discrimination is a crucial activity in characterizing oil reservoirs, and processing lithology microscopic images is an essential technique for investigating fossils and minerals and geological assessment of shale oil exploration. In this way, Deep Learning (DL) technique is a powerful approach for building robust classifier models. However, there is still a considerable challenge to collect and produce a large dataset. Transfer-learning and data augmentation techniques have emerged as popular approaches to tackle this problem. Furthermore, due to different reasons, especially data privacy, individuals, organizations, and industry companies often are not willing to share their sensitive data and information. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged to train a highly accurate central model across multiple decentralized edge servers without transferring sensitive data, preserving sensitive data, and enhancing security. This study involves two phases; the first phase is to conduct Lithology microscopic image classification on a small dataset using transfer learning. In doing so, various pre-trained DL model architectures are comprehensively compared for the classification task. In the second phase, we formulated the classification task to a Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) scheme and proposed a Fine-Tuned Aggregation strategy for Federated Learning (FTA-FTL). In order to perform a comprehensive experimental study, several metrics such as accuracy, f1 score, precision, specificity, sensitivity (recall), and confusion matrix are taken into account. The results are in excellent agreement and confirm the efficiency of the proposed scheme, and show that the proposed FTA-FTL algorithm is capable enough to achieve approximately the same results obtained by the centralized implementation for Lithology microscopic images classification task.

Abstract: The Bitcoin white paper introduced blockchain technology, enabling trustful transactions without intermediaries. Smart contracts emerged with Ethereum and blockchains expanded beyond cryptocurrency, applying to auctions, crowdfunding and electronic voting. However, blockchain's transparency raised privacy concerns and initial anonymity measures proved ineffective. Smart contract privacy solutions employed zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption and trusted execution environments. These approaches have practical drawbacks, such as limited functionality, high computation times and trust on third parties requirements, being not fully decentralized. This work proposes a solution utilizing zk-SNARKs to provide privacy in smart contracts and blockchains. The solution supports both fungible and nonfungible tokens. Additionally, the proposal includes a new type of transactions, called delegated transactions, which enable use cases like Delivery vs Payment (DvP).

Abstract: Blockchain technology has revolutionized industries by enabling secure and decentralized transactions. However, the isolated nature of blockchain ecosystems hinders the seamless transfer of digital assets across different chains. Cross-chain bridges have emerged as vital web3 infrastructure to address this challenge by facilitating interoperability between distinct blockchains. Cross-chain bridges remain vulnerable to various attacks despite sophisticated designs and security measures. The industry has experienced a surge in bridge attacks, resulting in significant financial losses. The largest hack impacted Axie Infinity Ronin Bridge, with a loss of almost \$600 million USD. This paper analyzes recent cross-chain bridge hacks in 2022 and 2023 and examines the exploited vulnerabilities. By understanding the attack nature and underlying weaknesses, the paper aims to enhance bridge security and propose potential countermeasures. The findings contribute to developing industry-wide standards for bridge security and operational resilience. Addressing the vulnerabilities and weaknesses exploited in recent cross-chain bridge hacks fosters trust and confidence in cross-chain interoperability.

总结:<br>
针对物联网系统中日益增长的安全需求，本文提出了一种结合零信任架构(ZTA)与去中心化联邦学习(DFL)的动态认证和细粒度授权方案，应用于跨域IoT网络。该方案通过持续监控和评估设备请求，仅授予必要的访问权限，以提高安全性并减少效率问题。为了保护用户数据隐私和降低延迟，文中将DFL集成到ZTA中，实现设备数据在不同领域的安全高效共享。同时，提出了模型压缩方法来减轻网络传输负载，并设计了一个动态自适应权重调整机制，使DFL模型能更好地适应来自不同域的数据特性。通过对提出的方案进行安全性分析（包括机密性、完整性和可用性）以及模拟实验，结果表明该方案在降低延迟和提升吞吐量方面相较于其他现有方案具有更优表现。 <div>

Abstract: With the increasing number of connected devices and complex networks involved, current domain-specific security techniques become inadequate for diverse large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems applications. While cross-domain authentication and authorization brings lots of security improvement, it creates new challenges of efficiency and security. Zero trust architecture (ZTA), an emerging network security architecture, offers a more granular and robust security environment for IoT systems. However, extensive cross-domain data exchange in ZTA can cause reduced authentication and authorization efficiency and data privacy concerns. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dynamic authentication and granularized authorization scheme based on ZTA integrated with decentralized federated learning (DFL) for cross-domain IoT networks. Specifically, device requests in the cross-domain process are continuously monitored and evaluated, and only necessary access permissions are granted. To protect user data privacy and reduce latency, we integrate DFL with ZTA to securely and efficiently share device data across different domains. Particularly, the DFL model is compressed to reduce the network transmission load. Meanwhile, a dynamic adaptive weight adjustment mechanism is proposed to enable the DFL model to adapt to data characteristics from different domains. We analyze the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of security proof, including confidentiality, integrity and availability. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme in terms of lower latency and higher throughput compared to other existing representative schemes.

总结:<br>

Abstract: With the advancement of blockchain technology, chained Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols have been increasingly adopted in practical systems, making their performance a crucial aspect of the study. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework utilizing Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to model and assess the performance of three prominent chained BFT protocols. Our framework effectively captures complex adversarial behaviors, focusing on two key performance metrics: chain growth and commitment rate. We implement the optimal attack strategies obtained from MDP analysis on an existing evaluation platform for chained BFT protocols and conduct extensive experiments under various settings to validate our theoretical results. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and thorough practical experiments, we provide an in-depth evaluation of chained BFT protocols under diverse attack scenarios, uncovering optimal attack strategies. Contrary to conventional belief, our findings reveal that while responsiveness can enhance performance, it is not universally beneficial across all scenarios. This work not only deepens our understanding of chained BFT protocols, but also offers valuable insights and analytical tools that can inform the design of more robust and efficient protocols.

Abstract: Sharding is a promising technique for addressing the scalability issues of blockchain, and this technique is especially important for IoT, edge, or mobile computing. It divides the $n$ participating nodes into $s$ disjoint groups called shards, where each shard processes transactions in parallel. We examine batch scheduling problems on the shard graph $G_s$, where we find efficient schedules for a set of transactions. First, we present a centralized scheduler where one of the shards is considered as a leader, who receives the transaction information from all of the other shards and determines the schedule to process the transactions. For general graphs, where a transaction and its accessing objects are arbitrarily far from each other with a maximum distance $d$, the centralized scheduler provides $O(kd)$ approximation to the optimal schedule, where $k$ is the maximum number of shards each transaction accesses. Next, we provide a centralized scheduler with a bucketing approach that offers improved bounds for the case where $G_s$ is a line graph, or the $k$ objects are randomly selected. Finally, we provide a distributed scheduler where shards do not require global transaction information. We achieve this by using a hierarchical clustering of the shards and using the centralized scheduler in each cluster. We show that the distributed scheduler has a competitive ratio of $O(A_{CS} \cdot \log d \cdot \log s)$, where $A_{CS}$ is the approximation ratio of the centralized scheduler. To our knowledge, we are the first to give provably fast transaction scheduling algorithms for blockchain sharding systems. We also present simulation results for our schedulers and compare their performance with a lock-based approach. The results show that our schedulers are generally better with up to 3x lower latency and 2x higher throughput.

Abstract: The advent of blockchain technology has facilitated the widespread adoption of smart contracts in the financial sector. However, current fraud detection methodologies exhibit limitations in capturing both global structural patterns within transaction networks and local semantic relationships embedded in transaction data. Most existing models focus on either structural information or semantic features individually, leading to suboptimal performance in detecting complex fraud patterns.In this paper, we propose a dynamic feature fusion model that combines graph-based representation learning and semantic feature extraction for blockchain fraud detection. Specifically, we construct global graph representations to model account relationships and extract local contextual features from transaction data. A dynamic multimodal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate these features, enabling the model to capture both structural and semantic fraud patterns effectively. We further develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline, including graph construction, temporal feature enhancement, and text preprocessing. Experimental results on large-scale real-world blockchain datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing benchmarks across accuracy, F1 score, and recall metrics. This work highlights the importance of integrating structural relationships and semantic similarities for robust fraud detection and offers a scalable solution for securing blockchain systems.

Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) are vital infrastructures, and contamination poses serious public health risks. Harmful substances can interact with disinfectants like chlorine, making chlorine monitoring essential for detecting contaminants. However, chlorine sensors often become unreliable and require frequent calibration. This study introduces the Dual-Threshold Anomaly and Drift Detection (AD&amp;DD) method, an unsupervised approach combining a dual-threshold drift detection mechanism with an LSTM-based Variational Autoencoder(LSTM-VAE) for real-time contamination detection. Tested on two realistic WDNs, AD&amp;DD effectively identifies anomalies with sensor offsets as concept drift, and outperforms other methods. A proposed decentralized architecture enables accurate contamination detection and localization by deploying AD&amp;DD on selected nodes.

Abstract: The convergence of humans and artificial intelligence systems introduces new dynamics into the cultural and intellectual landscape. Complementing emerging cultural evolution concepts such as machine culture, AI agents represent a significant technosociological development, particularly within the anthropological study of Web3 as a community focused on decentralization through blockchain. Despite their growing presence, the cultural significance of AI agents remains largely unexplored in academic literature. We argue that, within the context of Web3, these agents challenge traditional notions of participation and influence in public discourse, creating a hybrid marketplace of ideas, a conceptual space where human and AI generated ideas coexist and compete for attention. We examine the current state of AI agents in idea generation, propagation, and engagement, positioning their role as cultural agents through the lens of memetics and encouraging further inquiry into their cultural and societal impact. Additionally, we address the implications of this paradigm for privacy, intellectual property, and governance, highlighting the societal and legal challenges of integrating AI agents into the hybrid marketplace of ideas.

Abstract: Verisign reported a 125 percent increase in data breaches within the healthcare sector in the United States during 2022, with 18.2 million patient records being impacted. Growing healthcare data volumes and diversification mean that medical information is becoming more valuable. Many Health Centers use various technologies to ease the classification, storage, and exchange of big data. This use can also make the health data of the users at risk and vulnerable. AI and blockchain are among the leading technologies at hand. With AI, data-driven operations and big data efficiency have been improved with respect to traditional techniques. Due to its potential to bring about improvements in health services and lower medical costs, this AI technology is regularly used in healthcare. Blockchain helps protect transactions on sharing information and private privacy as long as the exchange of knowledge is that of the standard. The objective of this analysis is to investigate the research and unique contributions since 2008 regarding blockchain-integrated AI and healthcare systems. The work sheds light on applied AI-based healthcare schemes with machine, ballistic, and acrylic learning and disparate blockchain structures. The use of technology in order to ensure patient data security and manage medical information effectively in healthcare settings offers a highly successful position for both healthcare providers and patients. From 2018 to 2021, the best year was 2021 to grow, enhancing everything to examine the download of the device and the counting of Google Academies, for which the joining perspective was borrowed; local research experts were asked, identified articles in recent years, and read reviews of large research grants.

Abstract: As blockchain technology and smart contracts become widely adopted, securing them throughout every stage of the transaction process is essential. The concern of improved security for smart contracts is to find and detect vulnerabilities using classical Machine Learning (ML) models and fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLM). The robustness of such work rests on a labeled smart contract dataset that includes annotated vulnerabilities on which several LLMs alongside various traditional machine learning algorithms such as DistilBERT model is trained and tested. We train and test machine learning algorithms to classify smart contract codes according to vulnerability types in order to compare model performance. Having fine-tuned the LLMs specifically for smart contract code classification should help in getting better results when detecting several types of well-known vulnerabilities, such as Reentrancy, Integer Overflow, Timestamp Dependency and Dangerous Delegatecall. From our initial experimental results, it can be seen that our fine-tuned LLM surpasses the accuracy of any other model by achieving an accuracy of over 90%, and this advances the existing vulnerability detection benchmarks. Such performance provides a great deal of evidence for LLMs ability to describe the subtle patterns in the code that traditional ML models could miss. Thus, we compared each of the ML and LLM models to give a good overview of each models strengths, from which we can choose the most effective one for real-world applications in smart contract security. Our research combines machine learning and large language models to provide a rich and interpretable framework for detecting different smart contract vulnerabilities, which lays a foundation for a more secure blockchain ecosystem.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has gained prominence as a decentralized machine learning paradigm, allowing clients to collaboratively train a global model while preserving data privacy. Despite its potential, FL faces significant challenges in heterogeneous environments, where varying client resources and capabilities can undermine overall system performance. Existing approaches primarily focus on maximizing global model accuracy, often at the expense of unfairness among clients and suboptimal system efficiency, particularly in non-IID (non-Independent and Identically Distributed) settings. In this paper, we introduce FLamma, a novel Federated Learning framework based on adaptive gamma-based Stackelberg game, designed to address the aforementioned limitations and promote fairness. Our approach allows the server to act as the leader, dynamically adjusting a decay factor while clients, acting as followers, optimally select their number of local epochs to maximize their utility. Over time, the server incrementally balances client influence, initially rewarding higher-contributing clients and gradually leveling their impact, driving the system toward a Stackelberg Equilibrium. Extensive simulations on both IID and non-IID datasets show that our method significantly improves fairness in accuracy distribution without compromising overall model performance or convergence speed, outperforming traditional FL baselines.

Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized, online planning approach for scalable maneuver planning for large constellations. While decentralized, rule-based strategies have facilitated efficient scaling, optimal decision-making algorithms for satellite maneuvers remain underexplored. As commercial satellite constellations grow, there are benefits of online maneuver planning, such as using real-time trajectory predictions to improve state knowledge, thereby reducing maneuver frequency and conserving fuel. We address this gap in the research by treating the satellite maneuver planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). This approach enables the generation of optimal maneuver policies online with low computational cost. This formulation is applied to the low Earth orbit collision avoidance problem, considering the problem of an active spacecraft deciding to maneuver to avoid a non-maneuverable object. We test the policies we generate in a simulated low Earth orbit environment, and compare the results to traditional rule-based collision avoidance techniques.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of blockchains, modern chained BFT protocols combining chaining and leader rotation to obtain better efficiency and leadership democracy have received increasing interest. Although the efficiency provisions of chained BFT protocols have been thoroughly analyzed, the leadership democracy has received little attention in prior work. In this paper, we scrutinize the leadership democracy of four representative chained BFT protocols, especially under attack. To this end, we propose a unified framework with two evaluation metrics, i.e., chain quality and censorship resilience, and quantitatively analyze chosen protocols through the Markov Decision Process (MDP). With this framework, we further examine the impact of two key components, i.e., voting pattern and leader rotation on leadership democracy. Our results indicate that leader rotation is not enough to provide the leadership democracy guarantee; an adversary could utilize the design, e.g., voting pattern, to deteriorate the leadership democracy significantly. Based on the analysis results, we propose customized countermeasures for three evaluated protocols to improve their leadership democracy with only slight protocol overhead and no change of consensus rules. We also discuss future directions toward building more democratic chained BFT protocols.

Abstract: Existing research on federated learning has been focused on the setting where learning is coordinated by a centralized entity. Yet the greatest potential of future collaborative intelligence would be unleashed in a more open and democratized setting with no central entity in a dominant role, referred to as "decentralized federated learning". New challenges arise accordingly in achieving both correct model training and fair reward allocation with collective effort among all participating nodes, especially with the threat of the Byzantine node jeopardising both tasks.
  In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized Byzantine fault-tolerant federated learning framework based on a novel Proof-of-Data (PoD) consensus protocol to resolve both the "trust" and "incentive" components. By decoupling model training and contribution accounting, PoD is able to enjoy not only the benefit of learning efficiency and system liveliness from asynchronous societal-scale PoW-style learning but also the finality of consensus and reward allocation from epoch-based BFT-style voting. To mitigate false reward claims by data forgery from Byzantine attacks, a privacy-aware data verification and contribution-based reward allocation mechanism is designed to complete the framework. Our evaluation results show that PoD demonstrates performance in model training close to that of the centralized counterpart while achieving trust in consensus and fairness for reward allocation with a fault tolerance ratio of 1/3.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is widely recognized as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm due to its model-sharing mechanism that avoids direct data exchange. However, model training inevitably leaves exploitable traces that can be used to infer sensitive information. In Decentralized FL (DFL), the overlay topology significantly influences its models' convergence, robustness, and security. This study explores the feasibility of inferring the overlay topology of DFL systems based solely on model behavior, introducing a novel Topology Inference Attack. A taxonomy of topology inference attacks is proposed, categorizing them by the attacker's capabilities and knowledge. Practical attack strategies are developed for different scenarios, and quantitative experiments are conducted to identify key factors influencing the attack effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that analyzing only the public models of individual nodes can accurately infer the DFL topology, underscoring the risk of sensitive information leakage in DFL systems. This finding offers valuable insights for improving privacy preservation in decentralized learning environments.

Abstract: Zero-Knowledge (ZK) rollups have become a popular solution for scaling blockchain systems, offering improved transaction throughput and reduced costs by aggregating Layer 2 transactions and submitting them as a single batch to a Layer 1 blockchain. However, the computational burden of generating validity proofs, a key feature of ZK rollups, presents significant challenges in terms of performance and decentralization. Current solutions rely on centralized infrastructure to handle the computational tasks, limiting the scalability and decentralization of rollup systems.
  This paper proposes CrowdProve, a prover orchestration layer for outsourcing computation to unreliable commodity hardware run by a broad community of small provers. We apply CrowdProve to proving transaction batches for a popular ZK rollup.
  Through our experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that community proving can achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases better than, existing centralized deployments. Our results show that even systems utilizing modest hardware configurations can match the performance of centralized solutions, making community-based proof generation a viable and cost-effective alternative. CrowdProve allows both the rollup operator and community participants to benefit: the operator reduces infrastructure costs by leveraging idle community hardware, while community provers are compensated for their contributions.

Abstract: Today, many auctions are carried out with the help of intermediary platforms like Google and eBay. We refer to such auctions as platform-assisted auctions.Traditionally, the auction theory literature mainly focuses on designing auctions that incentivize the buyers to bid truthfully,assuming that the platform always faithfully implements the auction. In practice, however, the platforms have been found to manipulate the auctions to earn more profit, resulting in high-profile anti-trust lawsuits. We propose a new model for studying platform-assisted auctions in the permissionless setting. We explore whether it is possible to design a dream auction in thisnew model, such that honest behavior is the utility-maximizing strategy for each individual buyer, the platform, the seller, as well as platform-seller or platform-buyer coalitions.Through a collection of feasibility and infeasibility results,we carefully characterize the mathematical landscape of platform-assisted auctions. We show how cryptography can lend to the design of an efficient platform-assisted auction with dream properties. Although a line of works have also used MPC or the blockchain to remove the reliance on a trusted auctioneer, our work is distinct in nature in several dimensions.First, we initiate a systematic exploration of the game theoretic implications when the service providers are strategic and can collude with sellers or buyers. Second, we observe that the full simulation paradigm is too stringent and leads to high asymptotical costs. Specifically, because every player has a different private outcomein an auction protocol, running any generic MPC protocol among the players would incur at least $n^2$ total cost. We propose a new notion of simulation calledutility-dominated emulation.Under this new notion, we showhow to design efficient auction protocols with quasilinear efficiency.

Abstract: Decentralized learning strategies allow a collection of agents to learn efficiently from local data sets without the need for central aggregation or orchestration. Current decentralized learning paradigms typically rely on an averaging mechanism to encourage agreement in the parameter space. We argue that in the context of deep neural networks, which are often over-parameterized, encouraging consensus of the neural network outputs, as opposed to their parameters can be more appropriate. This motivates the development of a new decentralized learning algorithm, termed DRT diffusion, based on deep relative trust (DRT), a recently introduced similarity measure for neural networks. We provide convergence analysis for the proposed strategy, and numerically establish its benefit to generalization, especially with sparse topologies, in an image classification task.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiac dyssynchrony are major public health problems in the United States. Precise cardiac image segmentation is crucial for extracting quantitative measures that help categorize cardiac dyssynchrony. However, achieving high accuracy often depends on centralizing large datasets from different hospitals, which can be challenging due to privacy concerns. To solve this problem, Federated Learning (FL) is proposed to enable decentralized model training on such data without exchanging sensitive information. However, bandwidth limitations and data heterogeneity remain as significant challenges in conventional FL algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient and adaptive federate learning method for cardiac segmentation that improves model performance while reducing the bandwidth requirement. Our method leverages the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to regularize model weight update and reduce communication overhead. We also propose a \mymethod{} aggregation technique to address data heterogeneity among clients. This technique adaptively penalizes the aggregated weights from different clients by comparing the validation accuracy in each client, allowing better generalization performance and fast local adaptation. In-client and cross-client evaluations on public cardiac MR datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over other LoRA-based federate learning approaches.

Abstract: Although, both double-spending and selfish-mining attacks have been extensively studied since the ``Bitcoin'' whitepaper of Nakamoto and the ``majority is not enough'' paper of Eyal and Sirer, there has been no rigorous stochastic analysis of an attack that combines the two, except for the complicated MDP models. In this paper, we first combine stubborn and selfish mining attacks, i.e., construct a strategy where the attacker acts stubborn until its private branch reaches a certain length and then switches to act selfish. We provide the optimal stubbornness for each parameter regime. Next, we provide the maximum stubbornness that is still more profitable than honest mining and argue a connection between the level of stubbornness and the $k$-confirmation rule. We show that, at each attack cycle, if the level of stubbornness is higher than $k$, there is a risk of double-spending which comes at no-cost to the adversary. The result can be seen as a guide for picking $k$ in the $k$-confirmation rule in a blockchain design. At each cycle, for a given stubbornness level, we rigorously formulate how great the risk of double-spending is. We provide the minimum double-spend value needed for an attack to be profitable in the regimes where the scheme is less profitable than honest mining. We further modify the attack in the stubborn regime in order to conceal the attack and increase the double-spending probability. Finally, we evaluate the results and provide the optimal and the maximum stubbornness levels for each parameter regime as well as the revenue. As a case study, with Bitcoin's $k=6$ block confirmation rule, we evaluate the revenue and double-spending risk of the attacks for each pool parameter.

Abstract: Decentralized Applications (DApps) have seen widespread use in the recent past driving the world towards a new decentralized version of the web known as Web3.0. DApp-supported blockchains like Ethereum have largely been responsible for this drive supporting the largest eco-system of DApps. Although the low performance provided by Ethereum has been a major impediment to realizing a decentralized web, several high-performance blockchains have been introduced recently to bridge this gap. Most of these blockchains rely on consensus optimizations. Only a few enhance other parts of the blockchain protocol that involves transaction management: the validation of transactions, broadcast of transactions, encapsulation and dissemination of blocks with transactions, re-validation and execution of transactions in blocks, storage of blocks, and confirmation of transaction commits to senders upon request.
  In this paper, we enhance transaction management by introducing a novel transaction validation reduction and a per sub-block processing to optimize the block storage. We empirically show the performance improvements gained by our enhanced transaction management in the Smart Red Belly Blockchain (SRBB) VM we develop. Finally, we integrate our SRBB VM to an already optimized consensus from a known blockchain to develop the Smart Red Belly Blockchain. Our results show that SRBB achieves a peak throughput of 4000 TPS and an average throughput of 2000 TPS on 200 nodes spread across 5 continents. SRBB outperforms 6 other blockchains when running the exchange DApp featuring a real workload trace taken from Nasdaq.

<div> 关键词：Proof-of-Work、比特币、挖矿算力、总成本、Targeted Nakamoto

总结:
<br />
本文探讨了Proof-of-Work机制下如比特币区块链中挖矿算力与区块奖励之间的关系。随着挖矿算力上升，网络安全成本降低但碳排放和电力消耗等外部性成本增加，存在一个挖矿算率区间使得总成本最小化。为了应对这一问题，文章提出了Targeted Nakamoto协议增强方案，该方案激励矿工将算力控制在一个目标区间。当算力超过目标值时，对矿工的区块奖励设置上限；而当算力低于目标值时，则设置奖励下限。为了维持货币中立性，协议会相应调整持有UTXO地址的支出潜力，以匹配奖励上限时的总额度扣除，以及奖励下限时的总额度增加。 <div>

Abstract: In a Proof-of-Work blockchain such as Bitcoin mining hashrate is increasing in the block reward. An increase in hashrate reduces network vulnerability to attack (a reduction in security cost) while increasing carbon emissions and electricity cost (an increase in externalities cost). This implies a tradeoff in total cost at different levels of hashrate and the existence of a hashrate interval where total cost is minimized. Targeted Nakamoto is a Proof-of-Work protocol augmentation that incentivizes miners to hone in on a target hashrate interval. When hashrate is above target a ceiling is placed on the block reward a miner can receive. When hashrate is below target a floor is placed underneath the miner's block reward. Monetary neutrality is maintained by a proportional increase in spending potential among addresses holding UTXO's to match a deduction from total block reward when the ceiling is operative and a proportional reduction in spending potential among addresses holding UTXO's to match an increase over the total block reward when the floor is binding.

<div> 关键词：Proof of Stake (PoS)，Lido，stETH，Leverage Staking，风险分析

总结:
本文介绍了以太坊权益证明（PoS）生态系统中，用户通过Lido质押ETH获取代表质押ETH并累积staking奖励的Liquid Staking Derivative（LSD）——stETH。这种衍生品提升了质押资产的流动性，使得它们能够在二级市场如Aave的抵押借款或Curve上的资产交换等场景中使用。文章建立了一个关于利用stETH进行杠杆质押的正式框架，并发现了在过去963天内在以太坊上存在的442个此类头寸，涉及总价值537,123 ETH（约8.77亿美元）。数据分析表明，81.7%的杠杆质押头寸获得了超过常规在Lido质押的年化收益率（APR）。然而，高回报也伴随着潜在风险，如Terra崩盘事件所示，代币贬值可能对市场产生影响。因此，文章进行了极端情况下stETH大幅贬值的压力测试，评估了相关的风险。模拟结果显示，杠杆质押会放大连锁清算的风险，通过清算和去杠杆化过程加剧卖压，不仅加速stETH价格下跌，还会引发传染效应，威胁到杠杆头寸及普通头寸的稳定性。 <div>

Abstract: In the Proof of Stake (PoS) Ethereum ecosystem, users can stake ETH on Lido to receive stETH, a Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) that represents staked ETH and accrues staking rewards. LSDs improve the liquidity of staked assets by facilitating their use in secondary markets, such as for collateralized borrowing on Aave or asset exchanges on Curve. The composability of Lido, Aave, and Curve enables an emerging strategy known as leverage staking, an iterative process that enhances financial returns while introducing potential risks. This paper establishes a formal framework for leverage staking with stETH and identifies 442 such positions on Ethereum over 963 days. These positions represent a total volume of 537,123 ETH (877m USD). Our data reveal that 81.7% of leverage staking positions achieved an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) higher than conventional staking on Lido. Despite the high returns, we also recognize the potential risks. For example, the Terra crash incident demonstrated that token devaluation can impact the market. Therefore, we conduct stress tests under extreme conditions of significant stETH devaluation to evaluate the associated risks. Our simulations reveal that leverage staking amplifies the risk of cascading liquidations by triggering intensified selling pressure through liquidation and deleveraging processes. Furthermore, this dynamic not only accelerates the decline of stETH prices but also propagates a contagion effect, endangering the stability of both leveraged and ordinary positions.

总结:
本文研究了在考虑隐私保护的个性化联邦学习框架下的面部表情识别（FER）问题。为解决这一问题，文章提出了一种新颖的不确定性感知标签细化的超图方法——AMY。该方法中，每个本地模型由一个主干网络、一个不确定性估计（UE）模块和一个表情分类（EC）模块组成。在UE模块，利用超图来建模表达式样本间的复杂高阶关系，并将这些关系融入到不确定性特征中。接着，设计了一个个性化不确定性估算器，用于对本地客户端中的样本进行可靠的不确定性权重估计。在EC模块，通过超图上的标签传播获取高质量细化标签，进而重新训练表情分类器。由此，AMY有效地缓解了不同客户端间异质性样本的不确定性，并在每个客户端中学习到了鲁棒的个性化FER模型。实验结果表明，AMY在两个具有挑战性的实际面部表情数据库上表现优于多个现有最优方法，证实了超图模型在不确定性估计和标签细化方面的优势。相关源代码将在https://github.com/mobei1006/AMY 发布。 <div>

Abstract: Most facial expression recognition (FER) models are trained on large-scale expression data with centralized learning. Unfortunately, collecting a large amount of centralized expression data is difficult in practice due to privacy concerns of facial images. In this paper, we investigate FER under the framework of personalized federated learning, which is a valuable and practical decentralized setting for real-world applications. To this end, we develop a novel uncertainty-Aware label refineMent on hYpergraphs (AMY) method. For local training, each local model consists of a backbone, an uncertainty estimation (UE) block, and an expression classification (EC) block. In the UE block, we leverage a hypergraph to model complex high-order relationships between expression samples and incorporate these relationships into uncertainty features. A personalized uncertainty estimator is then introduced to estimate reliable uncertainty weights of samples in the local client. In the EC block, we perform label propagation on the hypergraph, obtaining high-quality refined labels for retraining an expression classifier. Based on the above, we effectively alleviate heterogeneous sample uncertainty across clients and learn a robust personalized FER model in each client. Experimental results on two challenging real-world facial expression databases show that our proposed method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. This indicates the superiority of hypergraph modeling for uncertainty estimation and label refinement on the personalized federated FER task. The source code will be released at https://github.com/mobei1006/AMY.

<br /><br />总结:
本文探讨了一种针对联邦学习的新型攻击策略——MIGO，该策略旨在设计一种通用的后门植入方法，能够在多种防御机制下仍能悄无声息地将后门融入全局模型。MIGO通过使恶意模型更新与合法更新难以区分，实现对全球模型的逐步后门注入，并保证其持久性。实验结果显示，MIGO在五个不同数据集和模型架构上成功植入了三种类型的后门，同时保持了主任务的高准确率（超过90%）。此外，MIGO展现了强大的防御规避能力，对抗了包括多个最先进的防御方法在内的十种防御手段。与其他四种攻击策略相比，MIGO在大多数配置中表现出色，即使在极端情况下，仅控制了0.1%的客户端，只要攻击者能在足够多的轮次中持续攻击，也能实现成功的后门插入。 <div>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning technique that allows multiple entities to jointly train a model while preserving dataset privacy. However, its distributed nature has raised various security concerns, which have been addressed by increasingly sophisticated defenses. These protections utilize a range of data sources and metrics to, for example, filter out malicious model updates, ensuring that the impact of attacks is minimized or eliminated.
  This paper explores the feasibility of designing a generic attack method capable of installing backdoors in FL while evading a diverse array of defenses. Specifically, we focus on an attacker strategy called MIGO, which aims to produce model updates that subtly blend with legitimate ones. The resulting effect is a gradual integration of a backdoor into the global model, often ensuring its persistence long after the attack concludes, while generating enough ambiguity to hinder the effectiveness of defenses.
  MIGO was employed to implant three types of backdoors across five datasets and different model architectures. The results demonstrate the significant threat posed by these backdoors, as MIGO consistently achieved exceptionally high backdoor accuracy (exceeding 90%) while maintaining the utility of the main task. Moreover, MIGO exhibited strong evasion capabilities against ten defenses, including several state-of-the-art methods. When compared to four other attack strategies, MIGO consistently outperformed them across most configurations. Notably, even in extreme scenarios where the attacker controls just 0.1% of the clients, the results indicate that successful backdoor insertion is possible if the attacker can persist for a sufficient number of rounds.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising approach for training machine learning models on decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, privacy risks, particularly Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a specific data point belongs to a target client's training set, remain a significant concern. Existing methods for implementing MIAs in FL primarily analyze updates from the target client, focusing on metrics such as loss, gradient norm, and gradient difference. However, these methods fail to leverage updates from non-target clients, potentially underutilizing available information. In this paper, we first formulate a one-tailed likelihood-ratio hypothesis test based on the likelihood of updates from non-target clients. Building upon this formulation, we introduce a three-step Membership Inference Attack (MIA) method, called FedMIA, which follows the "all for one"--leveraging updates from all clients across multiple communication rounds to enhance MIA effectiveness. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedMIA outperforms existing MIAs in both classification and generative tasks. Additionally, it can be integrated as an extension to existing methods and is robust against various defense strategies, Non-IID data, and different federated structures. Our code is available in https://github.com/Liar-Mask/FedMIA.

Abstract: This work presents a novel communication framework for decentralized multi-agent systems operating in dynamic network environments. Integrated into a multi-agent reinforcement learning system, the framework is designed to enhance decision-making by optimizing the network's collective knowledge through efficient communication. Key contributions include adapting a static network packet-routing scenario to a dynamic setting with node failures, incorporating a graph attention network layer in a recurrent message-passing framework, and introducing a multi-round communication targeting mechanism. This approach enables an attention-based aggregation mechanism to be successfully trained within a sparse-reward, dynamic network packet-routing environment using only reinforcement learning. Experimental results show improvements in routing performance, including a 9.5 percent increase in average rewards and a 6.4 percent reduction in communication overhead compared to a baseline system. The study also examines the ethical and legal implications of deploying such systems in critical infrastructure and military contexts, identifies current limitations, and suggests potential directions for future research.

Abstract: This study proposes a unifying theoretical framework called generative emergent communication (generative EmCom) that bridges emergent communication, world models, and large language models (LLMs) through the lens of collective predictive coding (CPC). The proposed framework formalizes the emergence of language and symbol systems through decentralized Bayesian inference across multiple agents, extending beyond conventional discriminative model-based approaches to emergent communication. This study makes the following two key contributions: First, we propose generative EmCom as a novel framework for understanding emergent communication, demonstrating how communication emergence in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can be derived from control as inference while clarifying its relationship to conventional discriminative approaches. Second, we propose a mathematical formulation showing the interpretation of LLMs as collective world models that integrate multiple agents' experiences through CPC. The framework provides a unified theoretical foundation for understanding how shared symbol systems emerge through collective predictive coding processes, bridging individual cognitive development and societal language evolution. Through mathematical formulations and discussion on prior works, we demonstrate how this framework explains fundamental aspects of language emergence and offers practical insights for understanding LLMs and developing sophisticated AI systems for improving human-AI interaction and multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Software applications that run on a blockchain platform are known as DApps. DApps are built using smart contracts, which are immutable after deployment. Just like any real-world software system, DApps need to receive new features and bug fixes over time in order to remain useful and secure. However, Ethereum lacks native solutions for post-deployment smart contract maintenance, requiring developers to devise their own methods. A popular method is known as the upgradeability proxy contract (UPC), which involves implementing the proxy design pattern (as defined by the Gang of Four). In this method, client calls first hit a proxy contract, which then delegates calls to a certain implementation contract. Most importantly, the proxy contract can be reconfigured during runtime to delegate calls to another implementation contract, effectively enabling application upgrades. For researchers, the accurate detection of UPCs is a strong requirement in the understanding of how exactly real-world DApps are maintained over time. For practitioners, the accurate detection of UPCs is crucial for providing application behavior transparency and enabling auditing. In this paper, we introduce UPC Sentinel, a novel three-layer algorithm that utilizes both static and dynamic analysis of smart contract bytecode to accurately detect active UPCs. We evaluated UPC Sentinel using two distinct ground truth datasets. In the first dataset, our method demonstrated a near-perfect accuracy of 99%. The evaluation on the second dataset further established our method's efficacy, showing a perfect precision rate of 100% and a near-perfect recall of 99.3%, outperforming the state of the art. Finally, we discuss the potential value of UPC Sentinel in advancing future research efforts.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is regarded as a promising and revolutionary technology in 6G, aiming to transcend the constraints of ``Shannon's trap" by filtering out redundant information and extracting the core of effective data. Compared to traditional communication paradigms, SemCom offers several notable advantages, such as reducing the burden on data transmission, enhancing network management efficiency, and optimizing resource allocation. Numerous researchers have extensively explored SemCom from various perspectives, including network architecture, theoretical analysis, potential technologies, and future applications. However, as SemCom continues to evolve, a multitude of security and privacy concerns have arisen, posing threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of SemCom systems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the technologies that can be utilized to secure SemCom. Firstly, we elaborate on the entire life cycle of SemCom, which includes the model training, model transfer, and semantic information transmission phases. Then, we identify the security and privacy issues that emerge during these three stages. Furthermore, we summarize the techniques available to mitigate these security and privacy threats, including data cleaning, robust learning, defensive strategies against backdoor attacks, adversarial training, differential privacy, cryptography, blockchain technology, model compression, and physical-layer security. Lastly, this paper outlines future research directions to guide researchers in related fields.

Abstract: The dispersed node locations and complex topologies of edge networks, combined with intricate dynamic microservice dependencies, render traditional centralized microservice architectures (MSAs) unsuitable. In this paper, we propose a decentralized microservice architecture (DMSA), which delegates scheduling functions from the control plane to edge nodes. DMSA redesigns and implements three core modules of microservice discovery, monitoring, and scheduling for edge networks to achieve precise awareness of instance deployments, low monitoring overhead and measurement errors, and accurate dynamic scheduling, respectively. Particularly, DMSA has customized a microservice scheduling scheme that leverages multi-port listening and zero-copy forwarding to guarantee high data forwarding efficiency. Moreover, a dynamic weighted multi-level load balancing algorithm is proposed to adjust scheduling dynamically with consideration of reliability, priority, and response delay. Finally, we have implemented a physical verification platform for DMSA. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art and traditional scheduling schemes, DMSA effectively counteracts link failures and network fluctuations, improving the service response delay and execution success rate by approximately $60\% \sim 75\%$ and $10\%\sim15\%$, respectively.

Abstract: The proxy pattern is a well-known design pattern with numerous use cases in several sectors of the software industry. As such, the use of the proxy pattern is also a common approach in the development of complex decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. Despite the importance of proxy contracts, little is known about (i) how their prevalence changed over time, (ii) the ways in which developers integrate proxies in the design of DApps, and (iii) what proxy types are being most commonly leveraged by developers. This study bridges these gaps through a comprehensive analysis of Ethereum smart contracts, utilizing a dataset of 50 million contracts and 1.6 billion transactions as of September 2022. Our findings reveal that 14.2% of all deployed smart contracts are proxy contracts. We show that proxy contracts are being more actively used than non-proxy contracts. Also, the usage of proxy contracts in various contexts, transactions involving proxy contracts, and adoption of proxy contracts by users have shown an upward trend over time, peaking at the end of our study period. They are either deployed through off-chain scripts or on-chain factory contracts, with the former and latter being employed in 39.1% and 60.9% of identified usage contexts in turn. We found that while the majority (67.8%) of proxies act as an interceptor, 32.2% enables upgradeability. Proxy contracts are typically (79%) implemented based on known reference implementations with 29.4% being of type ERC-1167, a class of proxies that aims to cheaply reuse and clone contracts' functionality. Our evaluation shows that our proposed behavioral proxy detection method has a precision and recall of 100% in detecting active proxies. Finally, we derive a set of practical recommendations for developers and introduce open research questions to guide future research on the topic.

<div> 关键词：Fides、异步DAG、BFT共识协议、Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)、区块链系统

总结:<br />
本文提出了一个名为Fides的新式异步DAG基础的BFT共识协议，旨在解决现有协议面临的三个主要挑战。Fides利用可信执行环境(TEEs)来处理如下问题：<br />
1. 为容忍拜占庭副本而需要更大的共识群体规模（至少3倍大）的问题。<br />
2. 在异步网络中达成一致时高昂的通信成本和对全局公共随机数的依赖。<br />
3. 对抗审查以保证活性保障的脆弱性。<br />
通过采用四个基于TEE的信任组件——可靠广播、顶点验证、公共随机数以及交易披露，Fides实现了线性消息复杂度、确保的审查抵抗能力、扩大2倍的共识群体规模及轻量级公共随机数使用。此外，将这些核心组件抽象出来而非将整个协议迁移到TEE内，可以显著降低可信计算基数(TCB)。实验结果显示，相较于Tusk、RCC、HotStuff和PBFT等现行主流协议，Fides在本地和地理分布式网络中的性能更优，分别达到了每秒40万和81万笔交易的吞吐量。文章还分析了该协议的开销，证明了其在实际部署到真实世界区块链系统中的适用性和有效性。 <div>

Abstract: Recently, consensus protocols based on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) have gained significant attention due to their potential to build robust blockchain systems, particularly in asynchronous networks. In this paper, we propose Fides, an asynchronous DAG-based BFT consensus protocol that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to tackle three major scalability and security challenges faced by existing protocols: (i) the need for a larger quorum size (i.e., at least 3x larger) to tolerate Byzantine replicas, (ii) high communication costs and reliance on expensive cryptographic primitives (i.e., global common coin) to reach agreement in asynchronous networks, and (iii) poor censorship resilience undermining the liveness guarantee. Specifically, Fides adopts four trusted components-Reliable Broadcast, Vertex Validation, Common Coin, and Transaction Disclosure-within TEEs. Incorporating these components enables Fides to achieve linear message complexity, guaranteed censorship resilience, 2x larger quorum size, and lightweight common coin usage. Besides, abstracting these essential components rather than porting the entire protocol into TEE can significantly reduce the Trusted Computing Base (TCB). Experimental evaluations of Fides in local and geo-distributed networks demonstrate its superior performance compared to established state-of-the-art protocols such as Tusk, RCC, HotStuff, and PBFT. The results indicate that Fides achieves a throughput of 400k transactions per second in a geo-distributed network and 810k transactions per second in a local network. Our analysis further explores the protocol's overhead, highlighting its suitability and effectiveness for practical deployment in real-world blockchain systems.

Abstract: Applying multi-agent reinforcement learning methods to realistic settings is challenging as it may require the agents to quickly adapt to unexpected situations that are rarely or never encountered in training. Recent methods for generalization to such out-of-distribution settings are limited to more specific, restricted instances of distribution shifts. To tackle adaptation to distribution shifts, we propose Unexpected Encoding Scheme, a novel decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm where agents communicate "unexpectedness," the aspects of the environment that are surprising. In addition to a message yielded by the original reward-driven communication, each agent predicts the next observation based on previous experience, measures the discrepancy between the prediction and the actually encountered observation, and encodes this discrepancy as a message. Experiments on multi-robot warehouse environment support that our proposed method adapts robustly to dynamically changing training environments as well as out-of-distribution environment.

总结:
本文提出了一种名为Proof of Verifiable Functions (PoVF)的新颖共识机制，该机制旨在解决现有区块链共识机制中的中心化问题并提高系统的效率。PoVF基于可验证函数的可验证性和不可预测性，确保了区块链网络中所有节点拥有平等参与共识的机会，从而实现更充分的去中心化。同时，文中还提出了“延迟缓冲”结构，用于保证交易的顺序执行，防止因广播和交易执行混乱导致的区块链分叉。安全分析表明，PoVF具有可证明的安全性和抵抗潜在攻击的能力。实验结果显示，基于PoVF的区块链系统在仅配置有4核CPU的节点条件下，可以达到每秒处理4000笔交易的性能。此外，通过使用基尼系数评估区块链的去中心化程度，PoVF实现了在所采样区块链中最低的基尼系数0.39。实验表明，PoVF在保障去中心化与安全性的同时，亦具备较高的运行效率。 <div>

Abstract: Consensus mechanism is the core technology for blockchain to ensure that transactions are executed in sequence. It also determines the decentralization, security, and efficiency of blockchain. Existing mechanisms all have certain centralization issues and fail to ensure the decentralization of blockchain networks. A decentralized and efficient mechanism is required to improve blockchain systems. This paper proposes a fair consensus mechanism called Proof of Verifiable Functions (PoVF), based on the verifiability and unpredictability of verifiable functions. PoVF provides a sufficiently fair mechanism, ensuring that all nodes in blockchain network have equal opportunity to participate in consensus. In addition, a structure called "Delay buffer" is proposed to ensure transactions are executed sequentially. It delay the selection of blocks to avoid blockchain forks caused by broadcasting and transaction execution confusion. According to our security analysis, PoVF is provably secure and has the ability to resist potential adversaries. According to the experiments, PoVF-based blockchain can process up to 4000 transactions per second with nodes configured with only 4-core CPUs. This paper uses the Gini coefficient to measure the decentralization of blockchains, and the PoVF-based blockchain achieves the lowest Gini coefficient of 0.39 among all sampled blockchains. PoVF has been shown to provide sufficient efficiency while ensuring decentralization and security through experiments.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from pre-existing datasets without further interactions, making it a challenging task. Q-learning algorithms struggle with extrapolation errors in offline settings, while supervised learning methods are constrained by model expressiveness. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations in single-agent learning, but their application in multi-agent scenarios remains unclear. Generating trajectories for each agent with independent DMs may impede coordination, while concatenating all agents' information can lead to low sample efficiency. Accordingly, we propose MADiff, which is realized with an attention-based diffusion model to model the complex coordination among behaviors of multiple agents. To our knowledge, MADiff is the first diffusion-based multi-agent learning framework, functioning as both a decentralized policy and a centralized controller. During decentralized executions, MADiff simultaneously performs teammate modeling, and the centralized controller can also be applied in multi-agent trajectory predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that MADiff outperforms baseline algorithms across various multi-agent learning tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling complex multi-agent interactions. Our code is available at https://github.com/zbzhu99/madiff.

Abstract: A recent theory shows that a multi-player decentralized partially observable Markov decision process can be transformed into an equivalent single-player game, enabling the application of \citeauthor{bellman}'s principle of optimality to solve the single-player game by breaking it down into single-stage subgames. However, this approach entangles the decision variables of all players at each single-stage subgame, resulting in backups with a double-exponential complexity. This paper demonstrates how to disentangle these decision variables while maintaining optimality under hierarchical information sharing, a prominent management style in our society. To achieve this, we apply the principle of optimality to solve any single-stage subgame by breaking it down further into smaller subgames, enabling us to make single-player decisions at a time. Our approach reveals that extensive-form games always exist with solutions to a single-stage subgame, significantly reducing time complexity. Our experimental results show that the algorithms leveraging these findings can scale up to much larger multi-player games without compromising optimality.

Abstract: The integration of bots in Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) fosters efficiency and automation. However, their use is also associated with predatory trading and market manipulation, and can pose threats to system integrity. It is therefore essential to understand the extent of bot deployment in DLTs; despite this, current detection systems are predominantly rule-based and lack flexibility. In this study, we present a novel approach that utilizes machine learning for the detection of financial bots on the Ethereum platform. First, we systematize existing scientific literature and collect anecdotal evidence to establish a taxonomy for financial bots, comprising 7 categories and 24 subcategories. Next, we create a ground-truth dataset consisting of 133 human and 137 bot addresses. Third, we employ both unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to detect bots deployed on Ethereum. The highest-performing clustering algorithm is a Gaussian Mixture Model with an average cluster purity of 82.6%, while the highest-performing model for binary classification is a Random Forest with an accuracy of 83%. Our machine learning-based detection mechanism contributes to understanding the Ethereum ecosystem dynamics by providing additional insights into the current bot landscape.

Abstract: Federated learning is a renowned technique for utilizing decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, real-world applications often face challenges like partially labeled datasets, where only a few locations have certain expert annotations, leaving large portions of unlabeled data unused. Leveraging these could enhance transformer architectures ability in regimes with small and diversely annotated sets. We conduct the largest federated cardiac CT analysis to date (n=8,104) in a real-world setting across eight hospitals. Our two-step semi-supervised strategy distills knowledge from task-specific CNNs into a transformer. First, CNNs predict on unlabeled data per label type and then the transformer learns from these predictions with label-specific heads. This improves predictive accuracy and enables simultaneous learning of all partial labels across the federation, and outperforms UNet-based models in generalizability on downstream tasks. Code and model weights are made openly available for leveraging future cardiac CT analysis.

Abstract: The shuffle model of differential privacy (DP) offers compelling privacy-utility trade-offs in decentralized settings (e.g., internet of things, mobile edge networks). Particularly, the multi-message shuffle model, where each user may contribute multiple messages, has shown that accuracy can approach that of the central model of DP. However, existing studies typically assume a uniform privacy protection level for all users, which may deter conservative users from participating and prevent liberal users from contributing more information, thereby reducing the overall data utility, such as the accuracy of aggregated statistics. In this work, we pioneer the study of segmented private data aggregation within the multi-message shuffle model of DP, introducing flexible privacy protection for users and enhanced utility for the aggregation server. Our framework not only protects users' data but also anonymizes their privacy level choices to prevent potential data leakage from these choices. To optimize the privacy-utility-communication trade-offs, we explore approximately optimal configurations for the number of blanket messages and conduct almost tight privacy amplification analyses within the shuffle model. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our segmented multi-message shuffle framework achieves a reduction of about 50\% in estimation error compared to existing approaches, significantly enhancing both privacy and utility.

Abstract: Demands for secure, ubiquitous, and always-available connectivity have been identified as the pillar design parameters of the next generation radio access networks (RANs). Motivated by this, the current contribution introduces a network architecture that leverages blockchain technologies to augment security in RANs, while enabling dynamic coverage expansion through the use of intermediate commercial or private wireless nodes. To assess the efficiency and limitations of the architecture, we employ Markov chain theory in order to extract a theoretical model with increased engineering insights. Building upon this model, we quantify the latency as well as the security capabilities in terms of probability of successful attack, for three scenarios, namely fixed topology fronthaul network, advanced coverage expansion and advanced mobile node connectivity, which reveal the scalability of the blockchain-RAN architecture.

Abstract: We introduce a Wireless Signal based Efficient multi-Robot eXploration (WiSER-X) algorithm applicable to a decentralized team of robots exploring an unknown environment with communication bandwidth constraints. WiSER-X relies only on local inter-robot relative position estimates, that can be obtained by exchanging signal pings from onboard sensors such as WiFi, Ultra-Wide Band, amongst others, to inform the exploration decisions of individual robots to minimize redundant coverage overlaps. Furthermore, WiSER-X also enables asynchronous termination without requiring a shared map between the robots. It also adapts to heterogeneous robot behaviors and even complete failures in unknown environment while ensuring complete coverage. Simulations show that WiSER-X leads to 58% lower overlap than a zero-information-sharing baseline algorithm-1 and only 23% more overlap than a full-information-sharing algorithm baseline algorithm-2.

Abstract: Collaborative multi-agent exploration of unknown environments is crucial for search and rescue operations. Effective real-world deployment must address challenges such as limited inter-agent communication and static and dynamic obstacles. This paper introduces a novel decentralized collaborative framework based on Reinforcement Learning to enhance multi-agent exploration in unknown environments. Our approach enables agents to decide their next action using an agent-centered field-of-view occupancy grid, and features extracted from $\text{A}^*$ algorithm-based trajectories to frontiers in the reconstructed global map. Furthermore, we propose a constrained communication scheme that enables agents to share their environmental knowledge efficiently, minimizing exploration redundancy. The decentralized nature of our framework ensures that each agent operates autonomously, while contributing to a collective exploration mission. Extensive simulations in Gymnasium and real-world experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our system, while all the results highlight the benefits of combining autonomous exploration with inter-agent map sharing, advancing the development of scalable and resilient robotic exploration systems.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem where a group of mobile agents needs to reach a set of goal locations, but it does not matter which agent reaches a specific goal. Unlike most of the existing works on this topic that typically assume the existence of the centralized planner (or controller) and limit the agents' moves to a predefined graph of locations and transitions between them, in this work we focus on the decentralized scenarios, when each agent acts individually relying only on local observations/communications and is free to move in arbitrary direction at any time. Our iterative approach involves agents individually selecting goals, exchanging them, planning paths, and at each time step choose actions that balance between progressing along the paths and avoiding collisions. The proposed method is shown to be complete under specific assumptions on how agents progress towards their current goals, and our empirical evaluation demonstrates its superiority over a baseline decentralized navigation approach in success rate (i.e. is able to solve more problem instances under a given time limit) and a comparison with the centralized TSWAP algorithm reveals its efficiency in minimizing trajectory lengths for mission accomplishment.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while preserving data privacy. However, optimally selecting participating collaborators in dynamic FL environments remains challenging. We present RL-HSimAgg, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) and similarity-weighted aggregation (simAgg) algorithm using harmonic mean to manage outlier data points. This paper proposes applying multi-armed bandit algorithms to improve collaborator selection and model generalization. By balancing exploration-exploitation trade-offs, these RL methods can promote resource-efficient training with diverse datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Epsilon-greedy (EG) and upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms for federated brain lesion segmentation. In simulation experiments on internal and external validation sets, RL-HSimAgg with UCB collaborator outperformed the EG method across all metrics, achieving higher Dice scores for Enhancing Tumor (0.7334 vs 0.6797), Tumor Core (0.7432 vs 0.6821), and Whole Tumor (0.8252 vs 0.7931) segmentation. Therefore, for the Federated Tumor Segmentation Challenge (FeTS 2024), we consider UCB as our primary client selection approach in federated Glioblastoma lesion segmentation of multi-modal MRIs. In conclusion, our research demonstrates that RL-based collaborator management, e.g. using UCB, can potentially improve model robustness and flexibility in distributed learning environments, particularly in domains like brain tumor segmentation.

总结:
区块链技术因其成功应用于比特币网络而受到广泛关注，并被提议用于改进传统会计系统。然而，与现实世界数据交互需要第三方Oracle介入，其特性可能降低预期的集成效益。本文通过文献回顾研究了区块链在会计领域整合中是否考虑并解决了Oracle带来的局限性问题。研究发现，尽管相关领域的文章数量较多，但针对Oracle局限性的实际研究却相对匮乏。有趣的是，在环境、社会和治理（ESG）报告方面，已经出现了针对Oracle局限性的解决方法，其中许可链被视为安全存储可持续性数据的有效支持方案。 <div>

Abstract: The Bitcoin Network is a sophisticated accounting system that allows its underlying cryptocurrency to be trusted even in the absence of a reliable financial authority. Given its undeniable success, the technology, generally referred to as blockchain, has also been proposed as a means to improve legacy accounting systems. Accounting for real-world data, however, requires the intervention of a third party known as an Oracle, which, having not the same characteristics as a blockchain, could potentially reduce the expected integration benefit. Through a systematic review of the literature, this study aims to investigate whether the papers concerning blockchain integration in accounting consider and address the limitations posed by oracles. A broad overview of the limitations that emerged in the literature is provided and distinguished according to the specific accounting integration. Results support the view that although research on the subject counts numerous articles, actual studies considering oracle limitations are lacking. Interestingly, despite the scarce production of papers addressing oracles in various accounting sectors, reporting for ESG already shows interesting workarounds for oracle limitations, with permissioned chains envisioned as a valid support for the safe storage of sustainability data.

Abstract: This paper explores advanced topics in complex multi-agent systems building upon our previous work. We examine four fundamental challenges in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL): non-stationarity, partial observability, scalability with large agent populations, and decentralized learning. The paper provides mathematical formulations and analysis of recent algorithmic advancements designed to address these challenges, with a particular focus on their integration with game-theoretic concepts. We investigate how Nash equilibria, evolutionary game theory, correlated equilibrium, and adversarial dynamics can be effectively incorporated into MARL algorithms to improve learning outcomes. Through this comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate how the synthesis of game theory and MARL can enhance the robustness and effectiveness of multi-agent systems in complex, dynamic environments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning scheme, where each participant data remains on the participating devices and only the local model generated utilizing the local computational power is transmitted throughout the database. However, the distributed computational nature of FL creates the necessity to develop a mechanism that can remotely trigger any network agents, track their activities, and prevent threats to the overall process posed by malicious participants. Particularly, the FL paradigm may become vulnerable due to an active attack from the network participants, called a poisonous attack. In such an attack, the malicious participant acts as a benign agent capable of affecting the global model quality by uploading an obfuscated poisoned local model update to the server. This paper presents a cross-device FL model that ensures trustworthiness, fairness, and authenticity in the underlying FL training process. We leverage trustworthiness by constructing a reputation-based trust model based on contributions of agents toward model convergence. We ensure fairness by identifying and removing malicious agents from the training process through an outlier detection technique. Further, we establish authenticity by generating a token for each participating device through a distributed sensing mechanism and storing that unique token in a blockchain smart contract. Further, we insert the trust scores of all agents into a blockchain and validate their reputations using various consensus mechanisms that consider the computational task.

Abstract: Tracking the evolution of smart contracts is a significant challenge, impeding on the advancement of research on smart contract analysis. Indeed, due to the inherent immutability of the underlying blockchain technology, each smart contract update results in a deployment at a new address, breaking the links between versions. Existing platforms like Etherscan lack the capability to trace the predecessor-successor relationships within a smart contract lineage, further hindering empirical research on contract evolution.
  We address this challenge for the research community towards building a reliable dataset of linked versions for various smart contracts, i.e., lineages: we introduce SCLineage, an automated infrastructure that accurately identifies and collects smart contract lineages by leveraging proxy contracts. We present SCLineageSet, an up-to-date, open-source dataset that facilitates extensive research on smart contract evolution. We illustrate the applicability of our proposal in software engineering research through a case study that explores the evaluation of Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for forming contract lineages. This example underscores how SCLineage provides valuable insights for future research in the field.

Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) has empowered mobile devices (MDs) in supporting artificial intelligence (AI) applications through collaborative efforts with proximal MEC servers. Unfortunately, despite the great promise of device-edge cooperative AI inference, data privacy becomes an increasing concern. In this paper, we develop a privacy-aware multi-device cooperative edge inference system for classification tasks, which integrates a distributed bidding mechanism for the MEC server's computational resources. Intermediate feature compression is adopted as a principled approach to minimize data privacy leakage. To determine the bidding values and feature compression ratios in a distributed fashion, we formulate a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP) model, for which, a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-based algorithm is developed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in privacy-preserving cooperative edge inference. Specifically, given a sufficient level of data privacy protection, the proposed algorithm achieves 0.31-0.95% improvements in classification accuracy compared to the approach being agnostic to the wireless channel conditions. The performance is further enhanced by 1.54-1.67% by considering the difficulties of inference data.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) has recently been proposed as a method to enhance performance of large language models (LLMs), enabling multiple individual LLMs to work together for collaborative inference. This collaborative approach results in improved responses to user prompts compared to relying on a single LLM. In this paper, we consider such an MoA architecture in a distributed setting, where LLMs operate on individual edge devices, each uniquely associated with a user and equipped with its own distributed computing power. These devices exchange information using decentralized gossip algorithms, allowing different device nodes to talk without the supervision of a centralized server. In the considered setup, different users have their own LLM models to address user prompts. Additionally, the devices gossip either their own user-specific prompts or augmented prompts to generate more refined answers to certain queries. User prompts are temporarily stored in the device queues when their corresponding LLMs are busy. Given the memory limitations of edge devices, it is crucial to ensure that the average queue sizes in the system remain bounded. In this paper, we address this by theoretically calculating the queuing stability conditions for the device queues under reasonable assumptions, which we validate experimentally as well. Further, we demonstrate through experiments, leveraging open-source LLMs for the implementation of distributed MoA, that certain MoA configurations produce higher-quality responses compared to others, as evaluated on AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/purbeshmitra/distributed_moa.

Abstract: This paper studies a decentralized homogeneous multi-armed bandit problem in a multi-agent network. The problem is simultaneously solved by $N$ agents assuming they face a common set of $M$ arms and share the same arms' reward distributions. Each agent can receive information only from its neighbors, where the neighbor relationships among the agents are described by a fixed graph. Two fully decentralized upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms are proposed for undirected graphs, respectively based on the classic algorithm and the state-of-the-art Kullback-Leibler upper confidence bound (KL-UCB) algorithm. The proposed decentralized UCB1 and KL-UCB algorithms permit each agent in the network to achieve a better logarithmic asymptotic regret than their single-agent counterparts, provided that the agent has at least one neighbor, and the more neighbors an agent has, the better regret it will have, meaning that the sum is more than its component parts. The same algorithm design framework is also extended to directed graphs through the design of a variant of the decentralized UCB1 algorithm, which outperforms the single-agent UCB1 algorithm.

Abstract: In medical imaging, developing generalized segmentation models that can handle multiple organs and lesions is crucial. However, the scarcity of fully annotated datasets and strict privacy regulations present significant barriers to data sharing. Federated Learning (FL) allows decentralized model training, but existing FL methods often struggle with partial labeling, leading to model divergence and catastrophic forgetting. We propose ConDistFL, a novel FL framework incorporating conditional distillation to address these challenges. ConDistFL enables effective learning from partially labeled datasets, significantly improving segmentation accuracy across distributed and non-uniform datasets. In addition to its superior segmentation performance, ConDistFL maintains computational and communication efficiency, ensuring its scalability for real-world applications. Furthermore, ConDistFL demonstrates remarkable generalizability, significantly outperforming existing FL methods in out-of-federation tests, even adapting to unseen contrast phases (e.g., non-contrast CT images) in our experiments. Extensive evaluations on 3D CT and 2D chest X-ray datasets show that ConDistFL is an efficient, adaptable solution for collaborative medical image segmentation in privacy-constrained settings.

Abstract: Traditional smart contracts on blockchains excel at on-chain, deterministic logic. However, they have inherent limitations when dealing with large-scale off-chain data, dynamic multi-step workflows, and scenarios requiring high flexibility or iterative updates. In this paper, we propose the concept of a "Swarm Contract" (Swarm), a multi-agent mechanism wherein several digital life forms (DLF) or Sovereign Agents (SA) collectively handle complex tasks in Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). These digital entities are defined as autonomous software agents that own their code, state, and possibly on-chain assets, while operating free from centralized control.
  By leveraging a simple multi-signature wallet on-chain, Swarm moves most of the logic off-chain, achieving trust minimization through multi-agent consensus rather than a single monolithic on-chain contract. We illustrate these ideas with a lightweight off-chain auction example - minting and selling 10,000 identical NFTs - to showcase how off-chain coordination can determine a clearing price and finalize distribution, with each step performed collectively by multiple agents in TEE. This approach broadens the scope of trustless and decentralized solutions, potentially benefiting DAO governance, multi-modal data processing, and cross-chain interoperability.

Abstract: Traffic prediction represents one of the crucial tasks for smartly optimizing the mobile network. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has attracted attention to solve this problem thanks to its ability in cognizing the state of the mobile network and make intelligent decisions. Research on this topic has concentrated on making predictions in a centralized fashion, i.e., by collecting data from the different network elements and process them in a cloud center. This translates into inefficiencies due to the large amount of data transmissions and computations required, leading to high energy consumption. In this work, we investigate a fully decentralized AI solution for mobile traffic prediction that allows data to be kept locally, reducing energy consumption through collaboration among the base station sites. To do so, we propose a novel prediction framework based on edge computing and Deep Transfer Learning (DTL) techniques, using datasets obtained at the edge through a large measurement campaign. Two main Deep Learning architectures are designed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and tested under different training conditions. Simulation results show that the CNN architectures outperform the RNNs in accuracy and consume less energy. In both scenarios, DTL contributes to an accuracy enhancement in 85% of the examined cases compared to their stand-alone counterparts. Additionally, DTL significantly reduces computational complexity and energy consumption during training, resulting in a reduction of the energy footprint by 60% for CNNs and 90% for RNNs. Finally, two cutting-edge eXplainable Artificial Intelligence techniques are employed to interpret the derived learning models.

Abstract: This study aims to integrate blockchain technology into personality-based pair programming research to enhance its generalizability and adaptability by offering built-in continuous, reproducible, and transparent research. In the developing Role-Optimization Motivation Alignment (ROMA) framework, human/AI programming roles align with individual Big Five personality traits, optimizing individual motivation and team productivity in Very Small Entities and undergraduate courses. Twelve quasi-experimental sessions were conducted to verify the personality-based pair programming in distributed settings. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining intrinsic motivation inventories and qualitative insights. Data were stored transparently on the Solana blockchain, and a web-based application was developed in Rust and TypeScript languages to facilitate partner matching based on ROMA suggestions, expertise, and availability. The results suggest that blockchain can enhance research generalizability, reproducibility, and transparency, while ROMA can increase individual motivation and team performance. Future work can focus on integrating smart contracts for transparent and versioned data analysis.

<div> 关键词: Ethereum, Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS), MEV-Boost拍卖, 网络延迟, 中心化

总结:
本文探讨了以太坊区块生产过程中的Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS)机制，这是一种基于拍卖的流程，其中验证者可以将区块生产外包给构建者并通过MEV-Boost拍卖从构建者的竞标中获取Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)收益。通过实证博弈论分析，研究发现网络延迟和MEV机会访问优势对构建者在MEV-Boost拍卖中的投标策略和拍卖结果有显著影响。研究揭示了一个寡头动态现象：少数具备低延迟和丰富MEV资源的主导构建者受益于规模经济效应，强化了其市场力量，导致区块建造市场的中心化加剧和拍卖效率降低。这突显了公平分配构建者之间的MEV以及持续改善以太坊区块构建市场去中心化的挑战。 <div>

Abstract: The Ethereum block production process has evolved with the introduction of an auction-based mechanism known as Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS), allowing validators to outsource block production to builders and reap Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) revenue from builder bids in a decentralized market. In this market, builders compete in MEV-Boost auctions to have their blocks selected and earn potential MEV rewards. This paper employs empirical game-theoretic analysis to explore builders' strategic bidding incentives in MEV-Boost auctions, focusing on how advantages in network latency and access to MEV opportunities affect builders' bidding behaviors and auction outcomes. Our findings confirm an oligopolistic dynamic, where a few dominant builders, leveraging their advantages in latency and MEV access, benefit from an economy of scale that reinforces their market power, leading to increased centralization and reduced auction efficiency. Our analysis highlights the importance of fair MEV distribution among builders and the ongoing challenge of enhancing decentralization in the Ethereum block building market.

总结:
随着区块链平台数量的增长，独立网络间的资产和信息转移成为一个挑战，为此，跨链桥技术应运而生，通过建立通信协议促进跨链交互。然而，跨链交易的安全监管复杂性增加，需要超越传统单链检测方法的理解。本文提出了专门针对跨链环境设计的资产转移与消息传递为基础的跨链语义提取框架——XSema。实验表明，XSema在区分跨链与非跨链交易方面表现优越，对于泛化性和一般性指标分别超过现有方法9%和10%以上。此外，通过对跨链交易中的资产转移模式和消息传递事件日志进行分析，该研究为理解多区块链共存及跨链生态系统提供了新的洞见。 <div>

Abstract: As the number of blockchain platforms continues to grow, the independence of these networks poses challenges for transferring assets and information across chains. Cross-chain bridge technology has emerged to address this issue, establishing communication protocols to facilitate cross-chain interaction of assets and information, thereby enhancing user experience. However, the complexity of cross-chain transactions increases the difficulty of security regulation, rendering traditional single-chain detection methods inadequate for cross-chain scenarios. Therefore, understanding cross-chain transaction semantics is crucial, as it forms the foundation for cross-chain security detection tasks. Although there are existing methods for extracting transaction semantics specifically for single chains, these approaches often overlook the unique characteristics of cross-chain scenarios, limiting their applicability. This paper introduces XSema, a novel cross-chain semantic extraction framework grounded in asset transfer and message-passing, designed specifically for cross-chain contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that XSema effectively distinguishes between cross-chain and non-cross-chain transactions, surpassing existing methods by over 9% for the generality metric and over 10% for the generalization metric. Furthermore, we analyze the underlying asset transfer patterns and message-passing event logs associated with cross-chain transactions. We offer new insights into the coexistence of multiple blockchains and the cross-chain ecosystem.

<div> 关键词：JANUS、稳定币3.0协议、双代币系统、AI驱动、资本效率

总结:
本文介绍了JANUS，一个旨在同时解决稳定币三难困境——提高去中心化(D)、资本效率(E)和安全性稳定性(S)的稳定币3.0协议。JANUS基于前几代稳定币的经验，采用双代币系统(Alpha 和 Omega)，整合加密资产与现实世界资产(RWAs)，利用软挂钩机制，并运用AI驱动的稳定策略。文章构建了全面的理论框架，对D、E、S进行了正式定义，并证明了均衡存在的可能性，同时借鉴了国际贸易和开放经济宏观经济学的类比。通过引入由外部收益支持的第二代币，JANUS摆脱了庞氏动态，形成了更为稳健的基础。多抵押和软挂钩允许控制价格波动，而AI驱动的参数调整则能维持平衡。通过这些创新，JANUS力求接近稳定币三难困境的最优解，为DeFi和TradFi之间提供一个全球抗风险、通胀调整及去中心化的稳定币生态系统。正文部分概述了三难困境和JANUS的关键特点，附录中提供了更正式的数学处理，包括对去中心化、资本效率和稳定性的严格度量以及三难困境内在的优化挑战。 <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces JANUS, a Stablecoin 3.0 protocol designed to address the stablecoin trilemma--simultaneously improving decentralization (D), capital efficiency (E), and safety-stability (S). Building upon insights from previous stablecoin generations, JANUS leverages a dual-token system (Alpha and Omega), integrates crypto-assets and real-world assets (RWAs), employs a soft-peg mechanism, and utilizes AI-driven stabilization.
  We provide a comprehensive theoretical framework, including formal definitions of D, E, and S, along with equilibrium existence proofs and analogies drawn from international trade and open-economy macroeconomics. By introducing a second token backed by external yield, JANUS breaks from ponzinomic dynamics and creates a more robust foundation. Multi-collateralization and a soft peg enable controlled price oscillations, while AI-driven parameter adjustments maintain equilibrium.
  Through these innovations, JANUS aims to approach the center of the stablecoin trilemma, offering a globally resilient, inflation-adjusted, and decentralized stablecoin ecosystem bridging DeFi and TradFi. The main body presents a high-level overview of the trilemma and JANUS's key features, while the Appendix provides more formal mathematical treatments, including rigorous metrics for decentralization, capital efficiency, and stability, as well as the optimization challenges inherent in the trilemma.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of blockchain technology, smart contracts are now crucial to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Effective vulnerability detection is vital for securing these contracts against hackers and enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of security audits. In this paper, we present SimilarGPT, a unique vulnerability identification tool for smart contract, which combines Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models with Code-based similarity checking methods. The main concept of the SimilarGPT tool is to measure the similarity between the code under inspection and the secure code from third-party libraries. To identify potential vulnerabilities, we connect the semantic understanding capability of large language models (LLMs) with Code-based similarity checking techniques. We propose optimizing the detection sequence using topological ordering to enhance logical coherence and reduce false positives during detection. Through analysis of code reuse patterns in smart contracts, we compile and process extensive third-party library code to establish a comprehensive reference codebase. Then, we utilize LLM to conduct an indepth analysis of similar codes to identify and explain potential vulnerabilities in the codes. The experimental findings indicate that SimilarGPT excels in detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts, particularly in missed detections and minimizing false positives.

为提高多机器人在陌生环境中的探索效率，本文提出了一种名为Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Co-Navigation (MCoCoNav)的模块化协作语义导航方法。MCoCoNav利用多模态Chain-of-Thought结合视觉感知与Vision Language Models (VLMs)，通过概率评分评估探索价值，从而降低时间成本并提供稳定输出。同时，通过使用全局语义地图作为通信桥梁，既能减少通信开销，又能整合观察结果。机器人根据反映探索趋势的评分，决定是去探索新的前沿点还是重新访问历史节点。实验在HM3D_v0.2和MP3D数据集上验证了该方法的有效性。相关代码已开源，可在https://github.com/FrankZxShen/MCoCoNav.git获取。 <div>

Abstract: Understanding how humans cooperatively utilize semantic knowledge to explore unfamiliar environments and decide on navigation directions is critical for house service multi-robot systems. Previous methods primarily focused on single-robot centralized planning strategies, which severely limited exploration efficiency. Recent research has considered decentralized planning strategies for multiple robots, assigning separate planning models to each robot, but these approaches often overlook communication costs. In this work, we propose Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Co-Navigation (MCoCoNav), a modular approach that utilizes multimodal Chain-of-Thought to plan collaborative semantic navigation for multiple robots. MCoCoNav combines visual perception with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to evaluate exploration value through probabilistic scoring, thus reducing time costs and achieving stable outputs. Additionally, a global semantic map is used as a communication bridge, minimizing communication overhead while integrating observational results. Guided by scores that reflect exploration trends, robots utilize this map to assess whether to explore new frontier points or revisit history nodes. Experiments on HM3D_v0.2 and MP3D demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/FrankZxShen/MCoCoNav.git.

Abstract: With the prevalence of smart contracts, smart Ponzi schemes have become a common fraud on blockchain and have caused significant financial loss to cryptocurrency investors in the past few years. Despite the critical importance of detecting smart Ponzi schemes, a reliable and transparent identification approach adaptive to various smart Ponzi schemes is still missing. To fill the research gap, we first extract semantic-meaningful actions to represent the execution behaviors specified in smart contract bytecodes, which are derived from a literature review and in-depth interviews with domain experts. We then propose PonziLens+, a novel visual analytic approach that provides an intuitive and reliable analysis of Ponzi-scheme-related features within these execution behaviors. PonziLens+ has three visualization modules that intuitively reveal all potential behaviors of a smart contract, highlighting fraudulent features across three levels of detail. It can help smart contract investors and auditors achieve confident identification of any smart Ponzi schemes. We conducted two case studies and in-depth user interviews with 12 domain experts and common investors to evaluate PonziLens+. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of PonziLens+ in achieving an effective identification of smart Ponzi schemes.

Abstract: Smart contracts are the fundamental components of blockchain technology. They are programs to determine cryptocurrency transactions, and are irreversible once deployed, making it crucial for cryptocurrency investors to understand the cryptocurrency transaction behaviors of smart contracts comprehensively. However, it is a challenging (if not impossible) task for investors, as they do not necessarily have a programming background to check the complex source code. Even for investors with certain programming skills, inferring all the potential behaviors from the code alone is still difficult, since the actual behaviors can be different when different investors are involved. To address this challenge, we propose PrettiSmart, a novel visualization approach via execution simulation to achieve intuitive and reliable visual interpretation of smart contracts. Specifically, we develop a simulator to comprehensively capture most of the possible real-world smart contract behaviors, involving multiple investors and various smart contract functions. Then, we present PrettiSmart to intuitively visualize the simulation results of a smart contract, which consists of two modules: The Simulation Overview Module is a barcode-based design, providing a visual summary for each simulation, and the Simulation Detail Module is an augmented sequential design to display the cryptocurrency transaction details in each simulation, such as function call sequences, cryptocurrency flows, and state variable changes. It can allow investors to intuitively inspect and understand how a smart contract will work. We evaluate PrettiSmart through two case studies and in-depth user interviews with 12 investors. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of PrettiSmart in facilitating an easy interpretation of smart contracts.

arXiv:2412.18588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are compact representations of all public knowledge of our physical environment and animal and human behaviors. The application of LLMs to robotics may offer a path to highly capable robots that perform well across most human tasks with limited or even zero tuning. Aside from increasingly sophisticated reasoning and task planning, networks of (suitably designed) LLMs offer ease of upgrading capabilities and allow humans to directly observe the robot's thinking. Here we explore the advantages, limitations, and particularities of using LLMs to control physical robots. The basic system consists of four LLMs communicating via a human language data bus implemented via web sockets and ROS2 message passing. Surprisingly, rich robot behaviors and good performance across different tasks could be achieved despite the robot's data fusion cycle running at only 1Hz and the central data bus running at the extremely limited rates of the human brain, of around 40 bits/s. The use of natural language for inter-LLM communication allowed the robot's reasoning and decision making to be directly observed by humans and made it trivial to bias the system's behavior with sets of rules written in plain English. These rules were immutably written into Ethereum, a global, public, and censorship resistant Turing-complete computer. We suggest that by using natural language as the data bus among interacting AIs, and immutable public ledgers to store behavior constraints, it is possible to build robots that combine unexpectedly rich performance, upgradability, and durable alignment with humans.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of GameFi, a fusion of gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi), there exists a critical need to enhance player engagement and economic interaction within gaming ecosystems. Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.

Abstract: Robust coordination skills enable agents to operate cohesively in shared environments, together towards a common goal and, ideally, individually without hindering each other's progress. To this end, this paper presents Coordinated QMIX (CoMIX), a novel training framework for decentralized agents that enables emergent coordination through flexible policies, allowing at the same time independent decision-making at individual level. CoMIX models selfish and collaborative behavior as incremental steps in each agent's decision process. This allows agents to dynamically adapt their behavior to different situations balancing independence and collaboration. Experiments using a variety of simulation environments demonstrate that CoMIX outperforms baselines on collaborative tasks. The results validate our incremental approach as effective technique for improving coordination in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Liquid staking and restaking represent recent innovations in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that garnered user interest and capital. Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), tokenized representations of staked tokens on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, are the leading staking method. LSTs offer users the ability to earn staking rewards while maintaining liquidity, enabling seamless integration into DeFi protocols and free tradeability. Restaking builds upon this concept by allowing staked tokens, LSTs or native Bitcoin tokens to secure additional protocols and PoS chains for supplementary rewards. Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) unlock liquidity of restaked assets. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) establishes a comprehensive framework for the technical and economic models of liquid staking protocols. Using this framework, we systematically compare protocols mechanics, including node operator selection, staking reward distribution, and slashing. Our empirical analysis of token performance reveals that protocol design and market dynamics impact token market value. We further present the recent developments in restaking and discuss associated risks and security implications. Lastly, we review the emerging literature on liquid staking and restaking.

Abstract: We introduce a new -- currently 42 gigabyte -- ``living'' dataset of phone images of dog feces, annotated with manually drawn or AI-assisted polygon labels. There are 6k full resolution images and 4k detailed polygon annotations. The collection and annotation of images started in late 2020 and the dataset grows by roughly 1GB a month. We train VIT and MaskRCNN baseline models to explore the difficulty of the dataset. The best model achieves a pixelwise average precision of 0.858 on a 691-image validation set and 0.847 on a small independently captured 30-image contributor test set. The most recent snapshot of dataset is made publicly available through three different distribution methods: one centralized (Girder) and two decentralized (IPFS and BitTorrent). We study of the trade-offs between distribution methods and discuss the feasibility of each with respect to reliably sharing open scientific data. The code to reproduce the experiments is hosted on GitHub, and the data is published under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Model weights are made publicly available with the dataset. Experimental hardware, time, energy, and emissions are quantified.

Abstract: Researchers all over the world are employing a variety of analysis approaches in attempt to provide a safer and faster solution for sharing resources via a Multi-access Edge Computing system. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is a job-sharing method within the edge server network whose main aim is to maximize the pace of the computing process, resulting in a more powerful and enhanced user experience. Although there are many other options when it comes to determining the fastest method for computing processes, our paper introduces a rather more extensive change to the system model to assure no data loss and/or task failure due to any scrutiny in the edge node cluster. RAFT, a powerful consensus algorithm, can be used to introduce an auction theory approach in our system, which enables the edge device to make the best decision possible regarding how to respond to a request from the client. Through the use of the RAFT consensus, blockchain may be used to improve the safety, security, and efficiency of applications by deploying it on trustful edge base stations. In addition to discussing the best-distributed system approach for our (MEC) system, a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm is also presented in order to reduce overall system latency. Assumed in our proposal is the existence of a cluster of N Edge nodes, each containing a series of tasks that require execution. A DDPG algorithm is implemented in this cluster so that an auction can be held within the cluster of edge nodes to decide which edge node is best suited for performing the task provided by the client.

<div> 关键词：federated learning, over-the-air FL (OtA-FL), communication overhead, gradient compression, federated zeroth-order estimation (Fed-ZOE)

总结:

随着6G及未来网络变得日益复杂和互联，联邦学习（FL）作为一种重要范式，可安全高效地利用分布式边缘数据进行AI训练。过空气隙联邦学习（OtA-FL）利用通信信号的叠加性质，实现与边缘设备数量无关的恒定通信开销。然而，空中训练神经网络仍会产生大量通信成本，因为传输符号数量等于可训练参数的数量。为解决此问题，通常采用的方法是通过梯度压缩和梯度稀疏化减少传输符号数，但这些方法与OtA-FL不兼容，会破坏其叠加特性。本文提出了一种名为联邦零阶估计（Fed-ZOE）的新框架，灵感来源于常用于零阶优化（ZOO）的随机梯度估计器（RGE）。在Fed-ZOE中，边缘设备按照标准FL的方式执行本地权重更新，而非发送完整的梯度向量，而是将本地模型更新向量以几个局部模型更新向量与随机向量的标量乘积形式发送给参数服务器（PS）。这些标量值使得PS能够使用RGE技巧以极低开销重构梯度，同时保持叠加属性。与常规利用RGE进行逐步梯度下降的ZOO不同，Fed-ZOE在传输前对本地模型更新向量进行压缩，从而实现更高的准确性和计算效率。数值评估结果显示，在CIFAR-10、TinyImageNet、SVHN、CIFAR-100和Brain-CT等数据集上，Fed-ZOE能够在大幅降低通信成本的同时，达到与Fed-OtA相当的性能。 <div>

Abstract: As 6G and beyond networks grow increasingly complex and interconnected, federated learning (FL) emerges as an indispensable paradigm for securely and efficiently leveraging decentralized edge data for AI. By virtue of the superposition property of communication signals, over-the-air FL (OtA-FL) achieves constant communication overhead irrespective of the number of edge devices (EDs). However, training neural networks over the air still incurs substantial communication costs, as the number of transmitted symbols equals the number of trainable parameters. To alleviate this issue, the most straightforward approach is to reduce the number of transmitted symbols by 1) gradient compression and 2) gradient sparsification. Unfortunately, these methods are incompatible with OtA-FL due to the loss of its superposition property. In this work, we introduce federated zeroth-order estimation (Fed-ZOE), an efficient framework inspired by the randomized gradient estimator (RGE) commonly used in zeroth-order optimization (ZOO). In FedZOE, EDs perform local weight updates as in standard FL, but instead of transmitting full gradient vectors, they send compressed local model update vectors in the form of several scalar-valued inner products between the local model update vectors and random vectors. These scalar values enable the parameter server (PS) to reconstruct the gradient using the RGE trick with highly reduced overhead, as well as preserving the superposition property. Unlike conventional ZOO leveraging RGE for step-wise gradient descent, Fed-ZOE compresses local model update vectors before transmission, thereby achieving higher accuracy and computational efficiency. Numerical evaluations using ResNet-18 on datasets such as CIFAR-10, TinyImageNet, SVHN, CIFAR-100, and Brain-CT demonstrate that Fed-ZOE achieves performance comparable to Fed-OtA while drastically reducing communication costs.

<br /><br />总结:
本文提出了一种名为FedCross的跨时间激励框架，用于解决联邦学习（Federated Learning）中因移动设备高流动性、间歇性连接和带宽限制导致的模型更新问题。FedCross分为两个阶段：第一阶段，采用多目标迁移算法优化任务分配，考虑资源约束并利用演化博弈论预测用户比例动态变化以减少频繁迁移；第二阶段，运用采购拍卖机制对基站进行奖励分配，确保提供优质模型的基站得到最优补偿，从而激励用户持续参与并保障FedCross的整体可行性。实验结果验证了FedCross理论上的合理性及其显著降低通信开销的效果。 <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) mitigates privacy leakage in decentralized machine learning by allowing multiple clients to train collaboratively locally. However, dynamic mobile networks with high mobility, intermittent connectivity, and bandwidth limitation severely hinder model updates to the cloud server. Although previous studies have typically addressed user mobility issue through task reassignment or predictive modeling, frequent migrations may result in high communication overhead. Overcoming this obstacle involves not only dealing with resource constraints, but also finding ways to mitigate the challenges posed by user migrations. We therefore propose an intertemporal incentive framework, FedCross, which ensures the continuity of FL tasks by migrating interrupted training tasks to feasible mobile devices. Specifically, FedCross comprises two distinct stages. In Stage 1, we address the task allocation problem across regions under resource constraints by employing a multi-objective migration algorithm to quantify the optimal task receivers. Moreover, we adopt evolutionary game theory to capture the dynamic decision-making of users, forecasting the evolution of user proportions across different regions to mitigate frequent migrations. In Stage 2, we utilize a procurement auction mechanism to allocate rewards among base stations, ensuring that those providing high-quality models receive optimal compensation. This approach incentivizes sustained user participation, thereby ensuring the overall feasibility of FedCross. Finally, experimental results validate the theoretical soundness of FedCross and demonstrate its significant reduction in communication overhead.

在未来日益由机器智能定义的世界中，如何管理和整合AI进入社会至关重要。文章指出现有的AI治理体系未能充分应对AI代理的崛起和集中与分散治理模型之间的辩论。为填补这一空白，提出了“伦理技术和全面监督系统”框架（ETHOS），该框架利用Web3技术，包括区块链、智能合约、去中心化自治组织和灵魂绑定代币，建立了一个去中心化的全球AI代理人注册库。ETHOS引入了AI特定法律实体的概念，使这些系统能够承担有限责任并通过保险和合规监控确保问责制。此外，该框架强调需要通过公共教育、透明度和国际协调等方式采取协作参与式的AI治理方法。ETHOS在创新与道德责任之间寻求平衡，为负责任地将AI代理人融入社会提供了前瞻性策略。最后，本文反映了我们所定义的一个新跨学科领域——处于AI、Web3和社会交汇点的系统思维的出现。 <div>

Abstract: In a world increasingly defined by machine intelligence, the future depends on how we govern the development and integration of AI into society. Recent initiatives, such as the EU AI Act, EDPB opinion, U.S. Bipartisan House Task Force and NIST AI Risk Management Report, highlight the urgent need for robust governance frameworks to address the challenges posed by advancing AI technologies. However, existing frameworks fail to adequately address the rise of AI agents or the ongoing debate between centralized and decentralized governance models. To bridge these gaps, we propose the Ethical Technology and Holistic Oversight System framework, which leverages Web3 technologies, including blockchain, smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organizations, and soulbound tokens, to establish a decentralized global registry for AI agents. ETHOS incorporates the concept of AI specific legal entities, enabling these systems to assume limited liability and ensuring accountability through mechanisms like insurance and compliance monitoring. Additionally, the framework emphasizes the need for a collaborative, participatory approach to AI governance, engaging diverse stakeholders through public education, transparency, and international coordination. ETHOS balances innovation with ethical accountability, providing a forward looking strategy for the responsible integration of AI agents into society. Finally, this exploration reflects the emergence of a new interdisciplinary field we define as Systems Thinking at the Intersection of AI, Web3, and Society.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, Smart Grids (SG), and electric vehicle energy management are integral components of the Internet of Energy (IoE) field. The integration of Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) and Blockchain (BC) technologies into the IoE domain offers potential benefits that have only been studied in the literature in a few works. In this paper, we investigate the state-of-art solutions that leverage both SDNs and blockchain within the realm of the IoE. We categorize these solutions based on the method of integrating SDN and BC into two categories. The first category is the blockchain for SDN, where blockchain enhances the SDN directly. The second category is blockchain and SDN, where both technologies are used to enhance the proposed solutions. We identify three distinct blockchain applications based on their usage: decentralizing the SDN control plane, serving as a decentralized platform, and improving security measures. Similarly, we observe that SDN serves as a performance enhancer, a substitute for traditional networking, and solely as a control and management framework. It is posited that integrating SDNs and blockchain into IoE leads to performance enhancements, improves security, enables decentralized operations, and eliminates single points of failure in the SDN control plane. Additionally, some unaddressed issues, such as energy efficiency, smart contract management, and scalability, are discussed as potential future directions.

Abstract: Cellular traffic forecasting is a critical task that enables network operators to efficiently allocate resources and address anomalies in rapidly evolving environments. The exponential growth of data collected from base stations poses significant challenges to processing and analysis. While machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for handling these large datasets and providing accurate predictions, their environmental impact, particularly in terms of energy consumption, is often overlooked in favor of their predictive capabilities. This study investigates the potential of two bio-inspired models: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Reservoir Computing through Echo State Networks (ESNs) for cellular traffic forecasting. The evaluation focuses on both their predictive performance and energy efficiency. These models are implemented in both centralized and federated settings to analyze their effectiveness and energy consumption in decentralized systems. Additionally, we compare bio-inspired models with traditional architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), to provide a comprehensive evaluation. Using data collected from three diverse locations in Barcelona, Spain, we examine the trade-offs between predictive accuracy and energy demands across these approaches. The results indicate that bio-inspired models, such as SNNs and ESNs, can achieve significant energy savings while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to traditional architectures. Furthermore, federated implementations were tested to evaluate their energy efficiency in decentralized settings compared to centralized systems, particularly in combination with bio-inspired models. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential of bio-inspired models for sustainable and privacy-preserving cellular traffic forecasting.

Abstract: The availability of challenging simulation environments is pivotal for advancing the field of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In cooperative MARL settings, the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) has gained prominence as a benchmark for algorithms following centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm. However, with continual advancements in SMAC, many algorithms now exhibit near-optimal performance, complicating the evaluation of their true effectiveness. To alleviate this problem, in this work, we highlight a critical issue: the default opponent policy in these environments lacks sufficient diversity, leading MARL algorithms to overfit and exploit unintended vulnerabilities rather than learning robust strategies. To overcome these limitations, we propose SMAC-HARD, a novel benchmark designed to enhance training robustness and evaluation comprehensiveness. SMAC-HARD supports customizable opponent strategies, randomization of adversarial policies, and interfaces for MARL self-play, enabling agents to generalize to varying opponent behaviors and improve model stability. Furthermore, we introduce a black-box testing framework wherein agents are trained without exposure to the edited opponent scripts but are tested against these scripts to evaluate the policy coverage and adaptability of MARL algorithms. We conduct extensive evaluations of widely used and state-of-the-art algorithms on SMAC-HARD, revealing the substantial challenges posed by edited and mixed strategy opponents. Additionally, the black-box strategy tests illustrate the difficulty of transferring learned policies to unseen adversaries. We envision SMAC-HARD as a critical step toward benchmarking the next generation of MARL algorithms, fostering progress in self-play methods for multi-agent systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/devindeng94/smac-hard.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized machine learning, enabling collaborative model training across diverse clients without sharing raw data. However, traditional FL approaches often face limitations in scalability and efficiency due to their reliance on synchronous client updates, which can result in significant delays and increased communication overhead, particularly in heterogeneous and dynamic environments. To address these challenges in this paper, we propose an Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) algorithm, which allows clients to update the global model independently and asynchronously. Our key contributions include a comprehensive convergence analysis of AFL in the presence of client delays and model staleness. By leveraging martingale difference sequence theory and variance bounds, we ensure robust convergence despite asynchronous updates. Assuming strongly convex local objective functions, we establish bounds on gradient variance under random client sampling and derive a recursion formula quantifying the impact of client delays on convergence. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical applicability of AFL by training a decentralized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based deep learning model on the CMIP6 climate dataset, effectively handling non-IID and geographically distributed data.
  The proposed AFL algorithm addresses key limitations of traditional FL methods, such as inefficiency due to global synchronization and susceptibility to client drift. It enhances scalability, robustness, and efficiency in real-world settings with heterogeneous client populations and dynamic network conditions. Our results underscore the potential of AFL to drive advancements in distributed learning systems, particularly for large-scale, privacy-preserving applications in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Root cause analysis (RCA) in Micro-services architecture (MSA) with escalating complexity encounters complex challenges in maintaining system stability and efficiency due to fault propagation and circular dependencies among nodes. Diverse root cause analysis faults require multi-agents with diverse expertise. To mitigate the hallucination problem of large language models (LLMs), we design blockchain-inspired voting to ensure the reliability of the analysis by using a decentralized decision-making process. To avoid non-terminating loops led by common circular dependency in MSA, we objectively limit steps and standardize task processing through Agent Workflow. We propose a pioneering framework, multi-Agent Blockchain-inspired Collaboration for root cause analysis in micro-services architecture (mABC), where multiple agents based on the powerful LLMs follow Agent Workflow and collaborate in blockchain-inspired voting. Specifically, seven specialized agents derived from Agent Workflow each provide valuable insights towards root cause analysis based on their expertise and the intrinsic software knowledge of LLMs collaborating within a decentralized chain. Our experiments on the AIOps challenge dataset and a newly created Train-Ticket dataset demonstrate superior performance in identifying root causes and generating effective resolutions. The ablation study further highlights Agent Workflow, multi-agent, and blockchain-inspired voting is crucial for achieving optimal performance. mABC offers a comprehensive automated root cause analysis and resolution in micro-services architecture and significantly improves the IT Operation domain.

Abstract: Real and effective regulation of contributions to greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants requires unbiased and truthful monitoring. Blockchain has emerged not only as an approach that provides verifiable economical interactions but also as a mechanism to keep the measurement, monitoring, incentivation of environmental conservationist practices and enforcement of policy. Here, we present a survey of areas in what blockchain has been considered as a response to concerns on keeping an accurate recording of environmental practices to monitor levels of pollution and management of environmental practices.

总结:<br />
本文关注在数据驱动的时代，处理垂直分布式数据集的算法的重要性，这些算法能增强数据隐私并提高可扩展性。研究重点在于在无随机访问（NRA）场景下计算非支配灵活天际线（ND）的问题，因为在此类情境中，经典top-k算法的随机访问变得不切实际或受限。文章介绍了一种适用于NRA场景的ND查询算法，证明了其正确性和类别内的最优性，并通过实验评估验证了其在各种情况下的性能，包括合成数据和真实数据。 <div>

Abstract: In today's data-driven world, algorithms operating with vertically distributed datasets are crucial due to the increasing prevalence of large-scale, decentralized data storage. These algorithms enhance data privacy by processing data locally, reducing the need for data transfer and minimizing exposure to breaches. They also improve scalability, as they can handle vast amounts of data spread across multiple locations without requiring centralized access. Top-k queries have been studied extensively under this lens, and are particularly suitable in applications involving healthcare, finance, and IoT, where data is often sensitive and distributed across various sources. Classical top-k algorithms are based on the availability of two kinds of access to sources: sorted access, i.e., a sequential scan in the internal sort order, one tuple at a time, of the dataset; random access, which provides all the information available at a data source for a tuple whose id is known. However, in scenarios where data retrieval costs are high or data is streamed in real-time or, simply, data are from external sources that only offer sorted access, random access may become impractical or impossible, due to latency issues or data access constraints. Fortunately, a long tradition of algorithms designed for the "no random access" (NRA) scenario exists for classical top-k queries. Yet, these do not cover the recent advances in ranking queries, proposing hybridizations of top-k queries (which are preference-aware and control the output size) and skyline queries (which are preference-agnostic and have uncontrolled output size). The non-dominated flexible skyline (ND) is one such proposal. We introduce an algorithm for computing ND in the NRA scenario, prove its correctness and optimality within its class, and provide an experimental evaluation covering a wide range of cases, with both synthetic and real datasets.

总结:
本文提出了一种名为Multi-LLM的摘要框架，并研究了两种不同的多LLM策略，包括集中式和分布式。该框架在每次对话回合中具有两个关键步骤：生成和评价。无论使用的是分布式还是集中式的多LLM策略，都有k个不同的LLM对文本生成多样化的摘要。然而，在评价阶段，集中式多LLM摘要方法利用单个LLM来评估并选择最佳摘要，而分布式则使用k个LLM进行评估。实验结果显示，多LLM摘要方法相对于仅使用单个LLM的基线方法性能显著提升，最高可达3倍。这些结果表明了多LLM方法在摘要任务上的有效性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a Multi-LLM summarization framework, and investigate two different multi-LLM strategies including centralized and decentralized. Our multi-LLM summarization framework has two fundamentally important steps at each round of conversation: generation and evaluation. These steps are different depending on whether our multi-LLM decentralized summarization is used or centralized. In both our multi-LLM decentralized and centralized strategies, we have k different LLMs that generate diverse summaries of the text. However, during evaluation, our multi-LLM centralized summarization approach leverages a single LLM to evaluate the summaries and select the best one whereas k LLMs are used for decentralized multi-LLM summarization. Overall, we find that our multi-LLM summarization approaches significantly outperform the baselines that leverage only a single LLM by up to 3x. These results indicate the effectiveness of multi-LLM approaches for summarization.

Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework has gained widespread adoption due to its strong performance. However, the further development of CTDE faces two key challenges. First, agents struggle to autonomously assess the relevance of input information for cooperative tasks, impairing their decision-making abilities. Second, in communication-limited scenarios with partial observability, agents are unable to access global information, restricting their ability to collaborate effectively from a global perspective. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel cooperative MARL framework based on information selection and tacit learning. In this framework, agents gradually develop implicit coordination during training, enabling them to infer the cooperative behavior of others in a discrete space without communication, relying solely on local information. Moreover, we integrate gating and selection mechanisms, allowing agents to adaptively filter information based on environmental changes, thereby enhancing their decision-making capabilities. Experiments on popular MARL benchmarks show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art algorithms, leading to significant performance improvements.

<div> 关键词：Local Differential Privacy（局部差分隐私）、Industrial Internet of Things（工业物联网）、poisoning attacks（中毒攻击）、PoisonCatcher、machine learning models

总结:
这篇论文关注的是局部差分隐私在工业物联网中遭受中毒攻击的问题。研究发现，由于局部差分隐私的模糊性与工业物联网的复杂性相互作用，存在一种新的规则中毒攻击，并统一了输入中毒和输出中毒的攻击形式化描述。论文揭示了两种主要的攻击影响：统计查询结果准确性下降和跨数据集相关性的破坏，以及攻击模式不稳定和被污染数据隐蔽的特点。针对这些问题，提出了名为PoisonCatcher的四阶段解决方案，该方案利用时间相似性、属性相关性和时间序列稳定性分析来检测表现出统计查询结果准确性降低、跨数据集关系中断和不稳定模式的数据集。通过增强特征工程，从数据中提取微弱的中毒签名，进而使用机器学习模型识别特定的受污染数据点。实验评估显示，PoisonCatcher在六个代表性攻击场景中的平均精度和召回率分别达到了86.17%和97.5%，取得了最先进的性能表现。 <div>

Abstract: Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is widely adopted in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for its lightweight, decentralized, and scalable nature. However, its perturbation-based privacy mechanism makes it difficult to distinguish between uncontaminated and tainted data, encouraging adversaries to launch poisoning attacks. While LDP provides some resilience against minor poisoning, it lacks robustness in IIoT with dynamic networks and substantial real-time data flows. Effective countermeasures for such attacks are still underdeveloped. This work narrows the critical gap by revealing and identifying LDP poisoning attacks in IIoT. We begin by deepening the understanding of such attacks, revealing novel threats that arise from the interplay between LDP indistinguishability and IIoT complexity. This exploration uncovers a novel rule-poisoning attack, and presents a general attack formulation by unifying it with input-poisoning and output-poisoning. Furthermore, two key attack impacts, i.e., Statistical Query Result (SQR) accuracy degradation and inter-dataset correlations disruption, along with two characteristics: attack patterns unstable and poisoned data stealth are revealed. From this, we propose PoisonCatcher, a four-stage solution that detects LDP poisoning attacks and identifies specific contaminated data points. It utilizes temporal similarity, attribute correlation, and time-series stability analysis to detect datasets exhibiting SQR accuracy degradation, inter-dataset disruptions, and unstable patterns. Enhanced feature engineering is used to extract subtle poisoning signatures, enabling machine learning models to identify specific contamination. Experimental evaluations show the effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance with average precision and recall rates of 86.17% and 97.5%, respectively, across six representative attack scenarios.

随着工业元宇宙的发展，数字孪生（DT）成为了焦点，而基于区块链的非同质化代币（NFT）为创建和拥有可克隆的DT提供了一种去中心化的方案。然而，NFT-DT面临着未经授权的复制或伪造的安全威胁。现有的NFT伪品检测方法多依赖于易于被篡改的静态信息如元数据和图像。针对这些问题，本文提出了一种结合自动编码器与RNN分类器的深度学习解决方案，实现实时模式识别以检测假冒NFT-DT。此外，文章还引入了动态元数据的概念，通过AI集成的智能合约提供更可靠的身份验证方式，有效识别并防范伪造的DT，从而强化了元宇宙中基于NFT资产的安全性。<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The rise of the industrial metaverse has brought digital twins (DTs) to the forefront. Blockchain-powered non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offer a decentralized approach to creating and owning these cloneable DTs. However, the potential for unauthorized duplication, or counterfeiting, poses a significant threat to the security of NFT-DTs. Existing NFT clone detection methods often rely on static information like metadata and images, which can be easily manipulated. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep-learning-based solution as a combination of an autoencoder and RNN-based classifier. This solution enables real-time pattern recognition to detect fake NFT-DTs. Additionally, we introduce the concept of dynamic metadata, providing a more reliable way to verify authenticity through AI-integrated smart contracts. By effectively identifying counterfeit DTs, our system contributes to strengthening the security of NFT-based assets in the metaverse.

总结:
本文针对资源受限的物联网边缘计算环境中的Split Federated学习方法，指出了当前研究忽视的四个关键问题：设备资源异质性与训练效率的关系、服务器端计算和网络资源分配对训练效率的影响、服务器侧子模型离散化带来的数据泄漏风险以及现有集中式算法的隐私缺陷。为解决这些问题，文章首先建立了使用Split Federated学习训练DNN模型的延迟和数据泄漏风险模型，并将Split Federated学习问题形式化为混合整数非线性规划问题。接着，提出了一种分散式的主动模型卸载与资源配置方案（DP-MORA），使每个终端设备可以根据自身的多维度训练配置自主确定切层位置和资源需求，无需了解其他设备的配置信息。通过在两个真实世界数据集上的大量实验，表明DP-MORA方案能有效降低DNN模型训练延迟，提升训练效率，并在各种实验设置下满足数据泄漏风险约束要求，相较于多个基线算法具有显著优势。 <div>

Abstract: In the resource-constrained IoT-edge computing environment, Split Federated (SplitFed) learning is implemented to enhance training efficiency. This method involves each terminal device dividing its full DNN model at a designated layer into a device-side model and a server-side model, then offloading the latter to the edge server. However, existing research overlooks four critical issues as follows: (1) the heterogeneity of end devices' resource capacities and the sizes of their local data samples impact training efficiency; (2) the influence of the edge server's computation and network resource allocation on training efficiency; (3) the data leakage risk associated with the offloaded server-side sub-model; (4) the privacy drawbacks of current centralized algorithms. Consequently, proactively identifying the optimal cut layer and server resource requirements for each end device to minimize training latency while adhering to data leakage risk rate constraint remains a challenging issue. To address these problems, this paper first formulates the latency and data leakage risk of training DNN models using Split Federated learning. Next, we frame the Split Federated learning problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming challenge. To tackle this, we propose a decentralized Proactive Model Offloading and Resource Allocation (DP-MORA) scheme, empowering each end device to determine its cut layer and resource requirements based on its local multidimensional training configuration, without knowledge of other devices' configurations. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the DP-MORA scheme effectively reduces DNN model training latency, enhances training efficiency, and complies with data leakage risk constraints compared to several baseline algorithms across various experimental settings.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents in environments involving human interaction has increasingly raised security concerns. Consequently, understanding the circumstances behind an event becomes critical, requiring the development of capabilities to justify their behaviors to non-expert users. Such explanations are essential in enhancing trustworthiness and safety, acting as a preventive measure against failures, errors, and misunderstandings. Additionally, they contribute to improving communication, bridging the gap between the agent and the user, thereby improving the effectiveness of their interactions. This work presents an accountability and explainability architecture implemented for ROS-based mobile robots. The proposed solution consists of two main components. Firstly, a black box-like element to provide accountability, featuring anti-tampering properties achieved through blockchain technology. Secondly, a component in charge of generating natural language explanations by harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) over the data contained within the previously mentioned black box. The study evaluates the performance of our solution in three different scenarios, each involving autonomous agent navigation functionalities. This evaluation includes a thorough examination of accountability and explainability metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in using accountable data from robot actions to obtain coherent, accurate and understandable explanations, even when facing challenges inherent in the use of autonomous agents in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape, trust is a critical yet underexplored factor shaping market behaviors and driving user preferences between centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Despite its importance, trust remains challenging to measure, limiting the study of its effects on market dynamics. The collapse of FTX, a major CEX, provides a unique natural experiment to examine the measurable impacts of trust and its sudden erosion on the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This pivotal event raised questions about the resilience of centralized trust systems and accelerated shifts toward decentralized alternatives. This research investigates the impacts of the FTX collapse on user trust, focusing on token valuation, trading flows, and sentiment dynamics. Employing causal inference methods, including Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and Difference-in-Differences (DID), we reveal significant declines in WETH prices and NetFlow from CEXs to DEXs, signaling a measurable transfer of trust. Additionally, natural language processing methods, including topic modeling and sentiment analysis, uncover the complexities of user responses, highlighting shifts from functional discussions to emotional fragmentation in Binance's community, while Uniswap's sentiment exhibits a gradual upward trend. Despite data limitations and external influences, the findings underscore the intricate interplay between trust, sentiment, and market behavior in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By bridging blockchain analytics, behavioral finance, and decentralized finance (DeFi), this study contributes to interdisciplinary research, offering a deeper understanding of distributed trust mechanisms and providing critical insights for future investigations into the socio-technical dimensions of trust in digital economies.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning methodology that involves the collaborative training of a global model across multiple decentralized clients in a privacy-preserving way. Several FL methods are introduced to tackle communication inefficiencies but do not address how to sample participating clients in each round effectively and in a privacy-preserving manner. In this paper, we propose \textit{FedSTaS}, a client and data-level sampling method inspired by \textit{FedSTS} and \textit{FedSampling}. In each federated learning round, \textit{FedSTaS} stratifies clients based on their compressed gradients, re-allocate the number of clients to sample using an optimal Neyman allocation, and sample local data from each participating clients using a data uniform sampling strategy. Experiments on three datasets show that \textit{FedSTaS} can achieve higher accuracy scores than those of \textit{FedSTS} within a fixed number of training rounds.

随着人工智能（AI）的迅速发展，其在开发和实施过程中面临的重大挑战日益凸显，主要归因于少数大型企业对AI的集中化控制。这种权力集中加剧了AI模型中的偏见问题，源于不充分的治理和监督机制，并限制了公众参与，引发了关于模型生成完整性的担忧。此外，这种对数据和AI输出的垄断控制威胁到了创新与公平的数据使用，因为用户无意间贡献的数据主要使这些大公司受益。为此，本文提出了一种基于区块链的去中心化AI训练平台——AIArena，旨在通过链上激励机制民主化AI的发展与对齐。AIArena致力于打造一个开放协作的环境，允许参与者贡献模型和计算资源。其链上共识机制确保根据参与者贡献程度公平分配奖励。文章将AIArena实例化并实现在公开的Base区块链Sepolia测试网上，并通过评估结果证明了AIArena在现实应用中的可行性。 <div>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI has underscored critical challenges in its development and implementation, largely due to centralized control by a few major corporations. This concentration of power intensifies biases within AI models, resulting from inadequate governance and oversight mechanisms. Additionally, it limits public involvement and heightens concerns about the integrity of model generation. Such monopolistic control over data and AI outputs threatens both innovation and fair data usage, as users inadvertently contribute data that primarily benefits these corporations. In this work, we propose AIArena, a blockchain-based decentralized AI training platform designed to democratize AI development and alignment through on-chain incentive mechanisms. AIArena fosters an open and collaborative environment where participants can contribute models and computing resources. Its on-chain consensus mechanism ensures fair rewards for participants based on their contributions. We instantiate and implement AIArena on the public Base blockchain Sepolia testnet, and the evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of AIArena in real-world applications.

Abstract: The 6GENABLERS-DLT project addresses critical challenges in fostering multi-party collaboration within dynamic 6G environments. As operators and service providers increasingly depend on third-party resources to meet their contractual and operational needs, the project introduces an innovative, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-anchored Marketplace designed to streamline decentralized telco resource trading. This 6GENABLERS Marketplace serves as a collaborative platform where operators, resource providers, and service providers can seamlessly discover, advertise, and trade telco assets within a transparent, secure, and efficient permissioned environment. Distinguished from public DLT-Blockchain solutions, the Marketplace's permissioned nature ensures robust governance, privacy, and control, making it particularly suited to enterprise and consortium-based use cases in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector. The adoption of a decentralized architecture eliminates reliance on a central operator, thereby mitigating risks associated with single points of failure and enhancing system trustworthiness, resilience, and fault tolerance. The Marketplace encompasses a wide range of resources integral to 6G networks, including virtualized mobile core components, Radio Access Network (RAN) assets, edge and cloud infrastructure, and vertical applications tailored to specific industry needs. This diversity enables stakeholders to dynamically access and scale resources, fostering operational efficiency and innovation across 6G ecosystems. Through the 6GENABLERS-DLT project, the vision of a collaborative, resource-rich 6G environment becomes a reality, laying the foundation for a next-generation telco ecosystem where decentralization empowers stakeholders to meet the demands of an interconnected, flexible, and scalable future.

<div> 关键词：ERC-20 Token、Trapdoor、恶意代码、智能合约、检测工具

总结:
本文研究了一种新型的ERC-20代币骗局——Trapdoor，这种骗局自2020年至2023年已在以太坊上最大的去中心化交易所Uniswap导致投资者数十亿美元的损失。文章首先系统地分类了Trapdoor代币并列出了诈骗者用于嵌入和隐藏恶意代码的各种技术。为了检测这类代币，研究团队开发了一款名为TrapdoorAnalyser的精细粒度检测工具，该工具通过对比买卖测试错误日志与合同语义检查中的Trapdoor指标列表来可靠地识别Trapdoor代币。相比于现有的商业工具GoPlus，TrapdoorAnalyser在准确性方面表现出色，并能提供恶意代码痕迹及完整解释。利用TrapdoorAnalyser，研究人员构建了首个包含约3万个Trapdoor和非Trapdoor代币的UniswapV2数据集，这使得能够训练机器学习算法以高精度检测无Solidity源码的Trapdoor代币。 <div>

Abstract: We investigate in this work a recently emerged type of scam ERC-20 token called Trapdoor, which has cost investors billions of US dollars on Uniswap, the largest decentralised exchange on Ethereum, from 2020 to 2023. In essence, Trapdoor tokens allow users to buy but preventing them from selling by embedding logical bugs and/or owner-only features in their smart contracts. By manually inspecting a number of Trapdoor samples, we established the first systematic classification of Trapdoor tokens and a comprehensive list of techniques that scammers used to embed and conceal malicious codes, accompanied by a detailed analysis of representative scam contracts. In particular, we developed TrapdoorAnalyser, a fine-grained detection tool that generates and crosschecks the error-log of a buy-and-sell test and the list of embedded Trapdoor indicators from a contract-semantic check to reliably identify a Trapdoor token. TrapdoorAnalyser not only outperforms the state-of-the-art commercial tool GoPlus in accuracy, but also provides traces of malicious code with a full explanation, which most of the existing tools lack. Using TrapdoorAnalyser, we constructed the very first dataset of about 30,000 Trapdoor and non-Trapdoor tokens on UniswapV2, which allows us to train several machine learning algorithms that can detect with very high accuracy even Trapdoor tokens with no available Solidity source codes.

总结:
本文研究了在现代通信系统中用于干扰缓解的关键技术——率分割多址接入（RSMA）的应用。文章重点关注在复杂多天线干扰信道中，采用深度强化学习优化RSMA的预编码方法和功率分配问题，特别是在涉及多个决策者的情况下。文中利用多智能体深度确定性策略梯度（MADDPG）框架解决这一复杂问题，使分布式代理能够协同学习并优化连续策略空间中的行动。同时，针对发射端不完善的信道侧信息所带来的挑战进行了探讨，并解决了共同和私有数据流的最佳解码顺序估计问题。仿真实验表明，基于MADDPG的提出的RSMA方法在单天线场景下能达到上界性能，在多天线场景下则接近理论极限，并明显优于无率分割的MADDPG、最大比传输（MRT）、零强迫（ZF）以及泄漏基预编码等其他技术。这些发现突显了深度强化学习驱动的RSMA在减少干扰和提升通信系统性能方面的潜力。 <div>

Abstract: This study explores the application of the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) technique, vital for interference mitigation in modern communication systems. It investigates the use of precoding methods in RSMA, especially in complex multiple-antenna interference channels, employing deep reinforcement learning. The aim is to optimize precoders and power allocation for common and private data streams involving multiple decision-makers. A multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework is employed to address this complexity, where decentralized agents collectively learn to optimize actions in a continuous policy space. We also explore the challenges posed by imperfect channel side information at the transmitter. Additionally, decoding order estimation is addressed to determine the optimal decoding sequence for common and private data sequences. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RSMA method based on MADDPG, achieving the upper bound in single-antenna scenarios and closely approaching theoretical limits in multi-antenna scenarios. Comparative analysis shows superiority over other techniques such as MADDPG without rate-splitting, maximal ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF), and leakage-based precoding methods. These findings highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning-driven RSMA in reducing interference and enhancing system performance in communication systems.

<div> 关键词：分布式账本、有向无环图(DAG)、UTXO交易、合作共识、可持续性

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种新的分布式账本（常被称为“区块链”）架构，该架构以有向无环图(DAG)的形式组织，其中UTXO交易作为顶点而非区块链中的块。通过实施特别设计的UTXO交易有效性约束，实现基于参与者合作的最大 ledger 覆盖规则的合作共识。这种合作行为由代币持有者驱动，他们是有权对账本进行修正的唯一类别，参与完全无需许可——没有矿工、验证者、委员会或质押机制，也无需了解所有参与共识的成员组成。此设置实现了高吞吐量、可扩展性和低交易成本，同时保持了比特币和其他工作量证明区块链中的高度去中心化、开放参与和异步特性，但避免了不合理的能源消耗。通过使用原生代币的方式，类似于权益证明区块链来实现Sybil防护，但该架构以无领导者方式运行，无需区块提议者和委员会选择。 <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel architecture for a distributed ledger, commonly referred to as a "blockchain", which is organized in the form of directed acyclic graph (DAG) with UTXO transactions as vertices, rather than as a chain of blocks. Consensus on the state of ledger assets is achieved through the cooperative consensus: a profit-driven behavior of token holders themselves, which is viable only when they cooperate by following the biggest ledger coverage rule. The cooperative behavior is facilitated by enforcing purposefully designed UTXO transaction validity constraints. Token holders are the sole category of participants authorized to make amendments to the ledger, making participation completely permissionless - without miners, validators, committees or staking - and without any need of knowledge about the composition of the set of all participants in the consensus. The setup allows to achieve high throughput and scalability alongside with low transaction costs, while preserving key aspects of high decentralization, open participation, and asynchronicity found in Bitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains, but without unreasonable energy consumption. Sybil protection is achieved similarly to proof-of-stake blockchains, using tokens native to the ledger, yet the architecture operates in a leaderless manner without block proposers and committee selection.

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种应用于分布式非线性模型预测控制（NMPC）的实时迭代（RTI）方案。该方案将RTI方法扩展到合作式分布式控制场景中，在每个采样时刻，对集中式的优化控制问题执行一次双层分散序列二次规划（dSQP）的外部迭代，确保满足实时性要求并促进子系统间的协作。结合新颖的dSQP收敛结果与RTI稳定性保证，文章证明了在标准MPC设计条件下，无论是否采用终端约束，都能实现局部指数稳定性。所提方案仅需要邻节点间通信，无需中央协调器。通过耦合倒立摆的数值例子，展示了该方法的有效性。 <div>

Abstract: This article presents a Real-Time Iteration (RTI) scheme for distributed Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The scheme transfers the well-known RTI approach, a key enabler for many industrial real-time NMPC implementations, to the setting of cooperative distributed control. At each sampling instant, one outer iteration of a bi-level decentralized Sequential Quadratic Programming (dSQP) method is applied to a centralized optimal control problem. This ensures that real-time requirements are met and it facilitates cooperation between subsystems. Combining novel dSQP convergence results with RTI stability guarantees, we prove local exponential stability under standard assumptions on the MPC design with and without terminal constraints. The proposed scheme only requires neighbor-to-neighbor communication and avoids a central coordinator. A numerical example with coupled inverted pendulums demonstrates the efficacy of the approach.

<br /><br />总结:
该项目WatchPlant提出使用分布式植物网络作为空气品质传感器，通过测量植物电生理学来推断环境状态。研究团队对常春藤（Hedera helix）进行了实验室实验，使其暴露于重要的污染物——臭氧中，并记录了其电生理响应。由于缺乏自动检测植物臭氧暴露的方法，他们提出了一个通用的自动化工具链，该工具链从电生理信号中提取植物和刺激源通用特征，并利用tsfresh库进行处理。接着，通过AutoML自动选择并优化机器学习模型，并运用前向特征选择提升模型性能。实验结果显示，他们的方法能够在未见数据上成功分类植物臭氧暴露，准确率高达94.6%。此外，这种方法还可应用于其他植物物种和刺激源。这一工具链实现了监测算法开发的自动化，为以植物为基础的污染物监测设备带来了显著进步，有助于未来低成本、高密度的城市空气质量监测系统的发展。 <div>

Abstract: In our project WatchPlant, we propose to use a decentralized network of living plants as air-quality sensors by measuring their electrophysiology to infer the environmental state, also called phytosensing. We conducted in-lab experiments exposing ivy (Hedera helix) plants to ozone, an important pollutant to monitor, and measured their electrophysiological response. However, there is no well established automated way of detecting ozone exposure in plants. We propose a generic automatic toolchain to select a high-performance subset of features and highly accurate models for plant electrophysiology. Our approach derives plant- and stimulus-generic features from the electrophysiological signal using the tsfresh library. Based on these features, we automatically select and optimize machine learning models using AutoML. We use forward feature selection to increase model performance. We show that our approach successfully classifies plant ozone exposure with accuracies of up to 94.6% on unseen data. We also show that our approach can be used for other plant species and stimuli. Our toolchain automates the development of monitoring algorithms for plants as pollutant monitors. Our results help implement significant advancements for phytosensing devices contributing to the development of cost-effective, high-density urban air monitoring systems in the future.

本文提出了一种针对基于区块链的物联网系统的新型隐私保护网络攻击检测框架。该框架利用人工智能驱动的检测模块在区块链节点上实现实时攻击识别，确保高精度和最小延迟。为了提高效率，模型训练由云服务提供商（CSP）执行，节点数据经同态加密后发送给CSP进行训练，以保障数据在整个学习过程中的隐私安全。为应对大量加密数据处理问题，文中引入一种创新的 SIMD 方式的打包算法，使得在HE加密数据上进行高效训练成为可能。同时，研究团队开发了适用于加密数据的深度神经网络训练算法，并提出了基于FedAvg算法的分布式隐私保护学习方法，通过并行化多工作器训练显著缩短计算时间。训练完成后，CSP将训练好的模型分发至区块链节点，使其能够进行实时、隐私保护的攻击检测。模拟结果显示，该提议的方法能有效减少训练时间，并实现与未加密情况下接近相同的检测精度，准确度差距约为0.01%。此外，针对不同区块链共识算法和硬件配置的实际部署验证表明，提出的框架也可适应于现实世界系统。 <div>

Abstract: This work proposes a novel privacy-preserving cyberattack detection framework for blockchain-based Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. In our approach, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven detection modules are strategically deployed at blockchain nodes to identify real-time attacks, ensuring high accuracy and minimal delay. To achieve this efficiency, the model training is conducted by a cloud service provider (CSP). Accordingly, blockchain nodes send their data to the CSP for training, but to safeguard privacy, the data is encrypted using homomorphic encryption (HE) before transmission. This encryption method allows the CSP to perform computations directly on encrypted data without the need for decryption, preserving data privacy throughout the learning process. To handle the substantial volume of encrypted data, we introduce an innovative packing algorithm in a Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) manner, enabling efficient training on HE-encrypted data. Building on this, we develop a novel deep neural network training algorithm optimized for encrypted data. We further propose a privacy-preserving distributed learning approach based on the FedAvg algorithm, which parallelizes the training across multiple workers, significantly improving computation time. Upon completion, the CSP distributes the trained model to the blockchain nodes, enabling them to perform real-time, privacy-preserved detection. Our simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method can not only mitigate the training time but also achieve detection accuracy that is approximately identical to the approach without encryption, with a gap of around 0.01%. Additionally, our real implementations on various blockchain consensus algorithms and hardware configurations show that our proposed framework can also be effectively adapted to real-world systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way computers understand and process human language, but using them effectively across different organizations remains still difficult. When organizations work together to improve LLMs, they face several main challenges. First, organizations hesitate to share their valuable data with others. Second, competition between organizations creates trust problems during collaboration. Third, new privacy laws require organizations to be able to delete specific data when requested, which is especially difficult when multiple organizations are learning from shared data. Traditional federated learning approaches do not address these interconnected challenges, particularly in scenarios where participants cannot fully trust each other or the central aggregator. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid blockchain-based federated learning framework that uniquely combines public and private blockchain architectures with multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our framework enables transparent sharing of model update through the public blockchain while protecting sensitive computations in private chains. Each organization operates as an intelligent agent, using Q-learning to optimize its participation strategy and resource allocation, thus aligning individual incentives with collective goals. Notably, we introduce an efficient unlearning mechanism based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) that enables selective removal of specific data contributions without compromising the model's overall performance. Through extensive experimentation on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our framework effectively balances privacy protection, trust establishment, and regulatory compliance while maintaining high model performance.

Abstract: Data sharing is ubiquitous in the metaverse, which adopts blockchain as its foundation. Blockchain is employed because it enables data transparency, achieves tamper resistance, and supports smart contracts. However, securely sharing data based on blockchain necessitates further consideration. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a promising primitive to provide confidentiality and fine-grained access control. Nonetheless, authority accountability and key abuse are critical issues that practical applications must address. Few studies have considered CP-ABE key confidentiality and authority accountability simultaneously. To our knowledge, we are the first to fill this gap by integrating non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs into CP-ABE keys and outsourcing the verification process to a smart contract. To meet the decentralization requirement, we incorporate a decentralized CP-ABE scheme into the proposed data sharing system. Additionally, we provide an implementation based on smart contract to determine whether an access control policy is satisfied by a set of CP-ABE keys. We also introduce an open incentive mechanism to encourage honest participation in data sharing. Hence, the key abuse issue is resolved through the NIZK proof and the incentive mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis and conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the data sharing system. Based on the proposed accountable approach, we further illustrate an application in GameFi, where players can play to earn or contribute to an accountable DAO, fostering a thriving metaverse ecosystem.

Abstract: This paper argues that existing governance mechanisms for mitigating risks from AI systems are based on the `Big Compute' paradigm -- a set of assumptions about the relationship between AI capabilities and infrastructure -- that may not hold in the future. To address this, the paper introduces the `Proliferation' paradigm, which anticipates the rise of smaller, decentralized, open-sourced AI models which are easier to augment, and easier to train without being detected. It posits that these developments are both probable and likely to introduce both benefits and novel risks that are difficult to mitigate through existing governance mechanisms. The final section explores governance strategies to address these risks, focusing on access governance, decentralized compute oversight, and information security. Whilst these strategies offer potential solutions, the paper acknowledges their limitations and cautions developers to weigh benefits against developments that could lead to a `vulnerable world'.

<br /><br />总结:

本文提出了一种去中心化的市场模型，其中代理人可以协商双边合同。该模型基于Hatfield等人(2013)提出的集中式交易网络模型。先前的工作已经证明，完全可替代的偏好保证了存在可以通过中心化计算得到的竞争均衡。然而，现实世界中如场外交易市场和二手车市场的价格是由代理人之间的“去中心化”谈判产生的，这使得从双边谈判中是否能涌现出均衡价格成为一个开放性问题。为此，文章设计了一个旨在捕捉市场参与者之间此类谈判的最佳响应动态过程。在假设市场参与者具有完全可替代偏好的情况下，对于稀疏市场（覆盖了许多实际感兴趣的市场），本文提供了收敛性的证明，并对于更一般的情况给出了实验结果，证实了价格确实能够通过双边谈判快速达到均衡。这种最佳响应动态及其收敛行为为理解去中心化市场如何达到并维持均衡提供了一个重要的初步研究。 <div>

Abstract: We propose a decentralized market model in which agents can negotiate bilateral contracts. This builds on a similar, but centralized, model of trading networks introduced by Hatfield et al. (2013). Prior work has established that fully-substitutable preferences guarantee the existence of competitive equilibria which can be centrally computed. Our motivation comes from the fact that prices in markets such as over-the-counter markets and used car markets arise from \textit{decentralized} negotiation among agents, which has left open an important question as to whether equilibrium prices can emerge from agent-to-agent bilateral negotiations. We design a best response dynamic intended to capture such negotiations between market participants. We assume fully substitutable preferences for market participants. In this setting, we provide proofs of convergence for sparse markets ({covering many real world markets of interest}), and experimental results for more general cases, demonstrating that prices indeed reach equilibrium, quickly, via bilateral negotiations. Our best response dynamic, and its convergence behavior, forms an important first step in understanding how decentralized markets reach, and retain, equilibrium.

Abstract: Blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative tool for data management in a variety of industries, including fintech, research and healthcare. We have developed a workable blockchain based system that utilizes non fungible tokens NFTs to tokenize and prove ownership of the academic institutions credentials. This makes it easier to create provenance and ownership documentation for academic data and meta credentials. This system enables the secure sharing of academic information while maintaining control, offering incentives for collaboration, and granting users full transparency and control over data access. While the initial adoption of these systems is crucial for ongoing service usage, the exploration of the user acceptance behavioural model remains limited in the existing literature. In this paper, we build upon the Technology Acceptance Model TAM, incorporating additional elements to scrutinize the impact of perceived ease of use, perceived usability, and attitude towards the system on the intention to use a blockchain based academic data and meta credentials sharing system. The research, grounded in user evaluations of a prototype, employs a TAM validated questionnaire. Results indicate that individual constructs notably affect the intention to use the system, and their collective impact is statistically significant. Specifically, perceived ease of use is the sole factor with an insignificant influence on the intention to use. The paper underscores the dominant influence of attitude towards the system on perceived usefulness. It concludes with a discussion on the implications of these findings within the context of blockchain based academic data and meta credentials sharing, incorporating NFTs for ownership definition.

总结:
为了解决日益严重的隐私问题，联邦学习被视为训练分布式医疗数据深度神经网络的重要方法。然而，不同机构间成像质量的不一致性成为了一个挑战，可能导致模型偏向高质量图像，从而产生公平性问题。本文首次提出了这一在成像质量偏移背景下的新公平性挑战，并指出传统促进联邦学习公平性的方法主要关注于平衡不同客户端分布的经验风险，但忽视了泛化能力的关键方面。针对此问题，文章提出了一种名为“基于客户端间尖锐度匹配的联邦学习”(FedISM)的方法，该方法通过引入尖锐度感知机制，旨在协调各客户端之间的图像清晰度水平以实现公平泛化。实验结果表明，FedISM在使用ICH和ISIC 2019数据集进行的评估中，相比于当前最先进的联邦学习方法，更能有效地提升公平性。相关代码已发布在https://github.com/wnn2000/FFL4MIA。 <div>

Abstract: Due to escalating privacy concerns, federated learning has been recognized as a vital approach for training deep neural networks with decentralized medical data. In practice, it is challenging to ensure consistent imaging quality across various institutions, often attributed to equipment malfunctions affecting a minority of clients. This imbalance in image quality can cause the federated model to develop an inherent bias towards higher-quality images, thus posing a severe fairness issue. In this study, we pioneer the identification and formulation of this new fairness challenge within the context of the imaging quality shift. Traditional methods for promoting fairness in federated learning predominantly focus on balancing empirical risks across diverse client distributions. This strategy primarily facilitates fair optimization across different training data distributions, yet neglects the crucial aspect of generalization. To address this, we introduce a solution termed Federated learning with Inter-client Sharpness Matching (FedISM). FedISM enhances both local training and global aggregation by incorporating sharpness-awareness, aiming to harmonize the sharpness levels across clients for fair generalization. Our empirical evaluations, conducted using the widely-used ICH and ISIC 2019 datasets, establish FedISM's superiority over current state-of-the-art federated learning methods in promoting fairness.

Abstract: We address the challenge of multi-agent cooperation, where agents achieve a common goal by cooperating with decentralized agents under complex partial observations. Existing cooperative agent systems often struggle with efficiently processing continuously accumulating information, managing globally suboptimal planning due to lack of consideration of collaborators, and addressing false planning caused by environmental changes introduced by other collaborators. To overcome these challenges, we propose the RElevance, Proximity, and Validation-Enhanced Cooperative Language Agent (REVECA), a novel cognitive architecture powered by GPT-4o-mini. REVECA enables efficient memory management, optimal planning, and cost-effective prevention of false planning by leveraging Relevance Estimation, Adaptive Planning, and Trajectory-based Validation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate REVECA's superiority over existing methods across various benchmarks, while a user study reveals its potential for achieving trustworthy human-AI cooperation.

Abstract: The detection of scams within Ethereum smart contracts is a critical challenge due to their increasing exploitation for fraudulent activities, leading to significant financial and reputational damages. Existing detection methods often rely on contract code analysis or manually extracted features, which suffer from scalability and adaptability limitations. In this study, we introduce an innovative method that leverages graph representation learning to examine transaction patterns and identify fraudulent contracts. By transforming Ethereum transaction data into graph structures and employing advanced machine learning models, we achieve robust classification performance. Our method addresses label imbalance through SMOTE-ENN techniques and evaluates models like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Experimental results indicate that the MLP model surpasses the GCN in this context, with real-world evaluations aligning closely with domain-specific analyses. This study provides a scalable and effective solution for enhancing trust and security in the Ethereum ecosystem.

本文介绍了针对零知识证明（ZKP）中的一种特殊类型——零知识简洁非交互式知识论证（zk-SNARKs）在FPGA上的加速器架构设计。文章重点关注了占据zk-SNARK系统大部分计算时间的多标量乘法（MSM）操作，并利用高度优化的Intel模数算术IP库。提出的架构充分利用了MSM的并行性，并采用了Intel OneAPI框架实现针对FPGA的设计。相较于参考软件库，该实现的速度提升了110倍至150倍，并且是首次报告使用BLS12-381和BN128椭圆曲线家族在FPGA硬件加速的结果。 <div>

Abstract: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) have emerged as an important cryptographic technique allowing one party (prover) to prove the correctness of a statement to some other party (verifier) and nothing else. ZKPs give rise to user's privacy in many applications such as blockchains, digital voting, and machine learning. Traditionally, ZKPs suffered from poor scalability but recently, a sub-class of ZKPs known as Zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledges (zk-SNARKs) have addressed this challenge. They are getting significant attention and are being implemented by many public libraries. In this paper, we present a novel scalable architecture that is suitable for accelerating the zk-SNARK prover compute on FPGAs. We focus on the multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) that accounts for the majority of computation time spent in zk-SNARK systems. The MSM calculations extensive rely on modular arithmetic so highly optimized Intel IP Libraries for modular arithmetic are used. The proposed architecture exploits the parallelism inherent to MSM and is implemented using the Intel OneAPI framework for FPGAs. Our implementation runs 110x-150x faster compared to reference software library, uses a generic curve form in Jacobian coordinates and is the first to report FPGA hardware acceleration results for BLS12-381 and BN128 family of elliptic curves.

Abstract: The growing adoption of formal verification for smart contracts has spurred the development of new verifiable languages like Move. However, the limited availability of training data for these languages hinders effective code generation by large language models (LLMs). This paper presents ConMover, a novel framework that enhances LLM-based code generation for Move by leveraging a knowledge graph of Move concepts and a small set of verified code examples. ConMover integrates concept retrieval, planning, coding, and debugging agents in an iterative process to refine generated code. Evaluations with various open-source LLMs demonstrate substantial accuracy improvements over baseline models. These results underscore ConMover's potential to address low-resource code generation challenges, bridging the gap between natural language descriptions and reliable smart contract development.

Abstract: Driven by the vision of ubiquitous connectivity and wireless intelligence, the evolution of ultra-dense constellation-based satellite-integrated Internet is underway, now taking preliminary shape. Nevertheless, the entrenched institutional silos and limited, nonrenewable heterogeneous network resources leave current satellite systems struggling to accommodate the escalating demands of next-generation intelligent applications. In this context, the distributed satellite information networks (DSIN), exemplified by the cohesive clustered satellites system, have emerged as an innovative architecture, bridging information gaps across diverse satellite systems, such as communication, navigation, and remote sensing, and establishing a unified, open information network paradigm to support resilient space information services. This survey first provides a profound discussion about innovative network architectures of DSIN, encompassing distributed regenerative satellite network architecture, distributed satellite computing network architecture, and reconfigurable satellite formation flying, to enable flexible and scalable communication, computing and control. The DSIN faces challenges from network heterogeneity, unpredictable channel dynamics, sparse resources, and decentralized collaboration frameworks. To address these issues, a series of enabling technologies is identified, including channel modeling and estimation, cloud-native distributed MIMO cooperation, grant-free massive access, network routing, and the proper combination of all these diversity techniques. Furthermore, to heighten the overall resource efficiency, the cross-layer optimization techniques are further developed to meet upper-layer deterministic, adaptive and secure information services requirements. In addition, emerging research directions and new opportunities are highlighted on the way to achieving the DSIN vision.

Abstract: Sidechain techniques improve blockchain scalability and interoperability, providing decentralized exchange and cross-chain collaboration solutions for Internet of Things (IoT) data across various domains. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) schemes for IoT multi-domain data exchange are constrained by the need for synchronous networks, hindering efficient cross-chain interactions in discontinuous networks and leading to suboptimal data exchange. In this paper, we propose AsyncSC, a novel asynchronous sidechain construction. It employs a committee to provide Cross-Blockchain as a Service (C-BaaS) for data exchange in multi-domain IoT. To fulfill the need for asynchronous and efficient data exchange, we combine the ideas of aggregate signatures and verifiable delay functions to devise a novel cryptographic primitive called delayed aggregate signature (DAS), which constructs asynchronous cross-chain proofs (ACPs) that ensure the security of cross-chain interactions. To ensure the consistency of asynchronous transactions, we propose a multilevel buffered transaction pool that guarantees the transaction sequencing. We analyze and prove the security of AsyncSC, simulate an asynchronous communication environment, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation. The results show that AsyncSC outperforms SOTA schemes, improving throughput by an average of 1.21 to 3.96 times, reducing transaction latency by 59.76% to 83.61%, and maintaining comparable resource overhead.

Abstract: The primary promise of decentralized learning is to allow users to engage in the training of machine learning models in a collaborative manner while keeping their data on their premises and without relying on any central entity. However, this paradigm necessitates the exchange of model parameters or gradients between peers. Such exchanges can be exploited to infer sensitive information about training data, which is achieved through privacy attacks (e.g Membership Inference Attacks -- MIA). In order to devise effective defense mechanisms, it is important to understand the factors that increase/reduce the vulnerability of a given decentralized learning architecture to MIA. In this study, we extensively explore the vulnerability to MIA of various decentralized learning architectures by varying the graph structure (e.g number of neighbors), the graph dynamics, and the aggregation strategy, across diverse datasets and data distributions. Our key finding, which to the best of our knowledge we are the first to report, is that the vulnerability to MIA is heavily correlated to (i) the local model mixing strategy performed by each node upon reception of models from neighboring nodes and (ii) the global mixing properties of the communication graph. We illustrate these results experimentally using four datasets and by theoretically analyzing the mixing properties of various decentralized architectures. Our paper draws a set of lessons learned for devising decentralized learning systems that reduce by design the vulnerability to MIA.

Abstract: Organizations seeking to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for knowledge querying and analysis often encounter challenges in maintaining an LLM fine-tuned on targeted, up-to-date information that keeps answers relevant and grounded. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has quickly become a feasible solution for organizations looking to overcome the challenges of maintaining proprietary models and to help reduce LLM hallucinations in their query responses. However, RAG comes with its own issues regarding scaling data pipelines across tiered-access and disparate data sources. In many scenarios, it is necessary to query beyond a single data silo to provide richer and more relevant context for an LLM. Analyzing data sources within and across organizational trust boundaries is often limited by complex data-sharing policies that prohibit centralized data storage, therefore, inhibit the fast and effective setup and scaling of RAG solutions. In this paper, we introduce Confidential Computing (CC) techniques as a solution for secure Federated Retrieval Augmented Generation (FedRAG). Our proposed Confidential FedRAG system (C-FedRAG) enables secure connection and scaling of a RAG workflows across a decentralized network of data providers by ensuring context confidentiality. We also demonstrate how to implement a C-FedRAG system using the NVIDIA FLARE SDK and assess its performance using the MedRAG toolkit and MIRAGE benchmarking dataset.

Abstract: Flocking is a behavior where multiple agents in a system attempt to stay close to each other while avoiding collision and maintaining a desired formation. This is observed in the natural world and has applications in robotics, including natural disaster search and rescue, wild animal tracking, and perimeter surveillance and patrol. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have displayed an impressive ability to solve various collaboration tasks as individual decision-makers. Solving multi-agent flocking with LLMs would demonstrate their usefulness in situations requiring spatial and decentralized decision-making. Yet, when LLM-powered agents are tasked with implementing multi-agent flocking, they fall short of the desired behavior. After extensive testing, we find that agents with LLMs as individual decision-makers typically opt to converge on the average of their initial positions or diverge from each other. After breaking the problem down, we discover that LLMs cannot understand maintaining a shape or keeping a distance in a meaningful way. Solving multi-agent flocking with LLMs would enhance their ability to understand collaborative spatial reasoning and lay a foundation for addressing more complex multi-agent tasks. This paper discusses the challenges LLMs face in multi-agent flocking and suggests areas for future improvement and research.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has recently garnered attention as a data-decentralized training framework that enables the learning of deep models from locally distributed samples while keeping data privacy. Built upon the framework, immense efforts have been made to establish FL benchmarks, which provide rigorous evaluation settings that control data heterogeneity across clients. Prior efforts have mainly focused on handling relatively simple classification tasks, where each sample is annotated with a one-hot label, such as MNIST, CIFAR, LEAF benchmark, etc. However, little attention has been paid to demonstrating an FL benchmark that handles complicated semantics, where each sample encompasses diverse semantic information from multiple labels, such as Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) with objects, subjects, and relations between them. Because the existing benchmark is designed to distribute data in a narrow view of a single semantic, e.g., a one-hot label, managing the complicated semantic heterogeneity across clients when formalizing FL benchmarks is non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a benchmark process to establish an FL benchmark with controllable semantic heterogeneity across clients: two key steps are i) data clustering with semantics and ii) data distributing via controllable semantic heterogeneity across clients. As a proof of concept, we first construct a federated PSG benchmark, demonstrating the efficacy of the existing PSG methods in an FL setting with controllable semantic heterogeneity of scene graphs. We also present the effectiveness of our benchmark by applying robust federated learning algorithms to data heterogeneity to show increased performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Seung-B/FL-PSG.

Abstract: Federated learning is a versatile framework for training models in decentralized environments. However, the trust placed in clients makes federated learning vulnerable to backdoor attacks launched by malicious participants. While many defenses have been proposed, they often fail short when facing heterogeneous data distributions among participating clients. In this paper, we propose a novel defense mechanism for federated learning systems designed to mitigate backdoor attacks on the clients-side. Our approach leverages adversarial learning techniques and model patching to neutralize the impact of backdoor attacks. Through extensive experiments on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, we demonstrate that our defense effectively reduces backdoor accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art defenses, such as LFighter, FLAME, and RoseAgg, in i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. scenarios, while maintaining competitive or superior accuracy on clean data.

Abstract: Voting is a cornerstone of collective participatory decision-making in contexts ranging from political elections to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Despite the proliferation of internet voting protocols promising enhanced accessibility and efficiency, their evaluation and comparison are complicated by a lack of standardized criteria and unified definitions of security and maturity. Furthermore, socio-technical requirements by decision makers are not structurally taken into consideration when comparing internet voting systems. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a trust-centric maturity scoring framework to quantify the security and maturity of sixteen internet voting systems. A comprehensive trust model analysis is conducted for selected internet voting protocols, examining their security properties, trust assumptions, technical complexity, and practical usability. In this paper we propose the electronic voting maturity framework (EVMF) which supports nuanced assessment that reflects real-world deployment concerns and aids decision-makers in selecting appropriate systems tailored to their specific use-case requirements. The framework is general enough to be applied to other systems, where the aspects of decentralization, trust, and security are crucial, such as digital identity, Ethereum layer-two scaling solutions, and federated data infrastructures. Its objective is to provide an extendable toolkit for policy makers and technology experts alike that normalizes technical and non-technical requirements on a univariate scale.

<br /><br />总结:
针对现有互联网存在的权力集中、安全隐患及IP协议刚性等问题，本文提出了一个新的网络架构——Co-governed Multi-Identifier Network (CoG-MIN，简称MIN)。该架构利用区块链技术确保全球各国在网络治理和法治方面的平等参与，并通过整合用户认证、数据签名和加密机制提升了网络安全性能，在国际网络安全竞赛中表现出色。此外，CoG-MIN支持不同标识系统的演进与互操作性，保持与IP协议兼容的同时，也为逐步过渡到非IP架构提供了适应性强的生态系统，有利于未来网络架构的多样化发展和持续进化。同时，文中还介绍了关于网络安全的三个定理。 <div>

Abstract: Since its inception in the 1960s, the internet has profoundly transformed human life. However, its original design now struggles to meet the evolving demands of modern society. Three primary defects have emerged: First, the concentration of power among a few dominant entities has intensified international conflicts and widened the technological divide. Second, the Internet Protocol (IP)-based system lacks inherent security, leading to frequent global cybersecurity incidents. Third, the rigidity of the IP protocol has hindered the sustainable development of cyberspace, as it resists necessary adaptations and innovations. Addressing these issues is crucial for the future resilience and security of the global digital landscape.
  To address these challenges, we propose the Co-governed Multi-Identifier Network (CoG-MIN briefly as MIN), a novel network architecture that leverages blockchain technology to ensure equal participation of countries worldwide in cyberspace governance and the rule of law. As a next-generation network system, CoG-MIN integrates mechanisms such as user authentication, data signatures, and encryption to significantly enhance network security. In testing environments, CoG-MIN has consistently withstood extensive attacks during various international cybersecurity competitions. Additionally, CoG-MIN supports the evolution and interoperability of different identifier systems, remains IP-compatible, and facilitates a gradual transition away from IP, providing an adaptable ecosystem for diverse network architectures. This adaptability fosters the development and evolution of diverse network architectures within CoG-MIN, making it a natural progression for the internet's future development.
  We further introduce a trilogy of cyberspace security theorems... (Due to character limitations, the full abstract is available in the paper PDF.)

<div> 关键词：scammer addresses, Rug Pulls, decentralized exchanges, scam network, wash trading

<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了普遍存在的连续欺诈者现象，这些欺诈者使用数千个地址在两个最流行的去中心化交易所（Uniswap 和 Pancakeswap）上进行一系列类似的拉高出货行为。研究人员首先构建了一个包含约384,000个欺诈地址的列表，这些地址涉及这两个平台上所有一天内的拉高出货事件，并识别出了多种独特的欺诈模式，如星形、链形和多数流欺诈集群。接着，他们提出了一种算法，能从给定的欺诈地址构建一个完整的欺诈网络，该网络不仅包括欺诈者地址，还包括存款人、取款人、转账者、协调者以及最重要的洗盘交易者。作者指出，现有针对拉高出货的研究未能考虑到洗盘交易的成本，导致利润估计值被夸大。通过了解洗盘交易者的身份，文章对单个欺诈池以及整个（连续）欺诈网络的真实利润进行了更为准确的估算，考虑到了洗盘交易的费用。 <div>

Abstract: We explored in this work the ubiquitous phenomenon of serial scammers, who deploy thousands of addresses to conduct a series of similar Rug Pulls on popular decentralized exchanges (DEXs). We first constructed a list of about 384,000 scammer addresses behind all 1-day Rug Pulls on the two most popular DEXs, Uniswap (Ethereum) and Pancakeswap (BSC), and identified many distinctive scam patterns including star-shaped, chain-shaped, and majority-flow scam clusters. We then proposed an algorithm to build a complete scam network from given scammer addresses, which consists of not only scammer addresses but also supporting addresses including depositors, withdrawers, transferrers, coordinators, and most importantly, wash traders. We note that profit estimations in existing works on Rug Pulls failed to capture the cost of wash trading, leading to inflated figures. Knowing who the wash traders are, we established a more accurate estimate for the true profit of individual scam pools as well as of the entire (serial) scam network by taking into account the wash-trading expenses.

总结:
本文提出了一种新的智能合约漏洞检测框架AF-STip，该框架针对现有模型泛化能力的局限性，通过数据免费的知识蒸馏方法，利用教师网络将处理过的智能合约知识迁移到学生模型中，增强其漏洞检测能力。AF-STip提升了模型的特征提取和跨类适应能力，并降低了计算开销。此外，文中还提出了一种自适应融合模块来强化特征信息的交互与融合，进一步提升漏洞特征的提取效果。实验结果显示，STip模型在不披露原始智能合约数据的情况下，对四种漏洞的平均F1值检测得分为91.16%。为了验证轻量级迁移学习方法的有效性，学生模型被部署到针对新型漏洞类型的迁移学习任务中，取得了91.02%的准确率和90.46%的F1得分。据作者所知，AF-STip是首个将无数据知识迁移应用于智能合约漏洞检测的模型，它在显著降低计算开销的同时，仍能展现出优异的新颖漏洞检测性能。 <div>

Abstract: As a cornerstone of blockchain technology in the 3.0 era, smart contracts play a pivotal role in the evolution of blockchain systems. In order to address the limitations of existing smart contract vulnerability detection models with regard to their generalisation capability, an AF-STip smart contract vulnerability detection framework incorporating efficient knowledge migration is proposed. AF-STip employs the teacher network as the main model and migrates the knowledge processed by the smart contract to the student model using a data-free knowledge distillation method. The student model utilises this knowledge to enhance its vulnerability detection capabilities. The approach markedly enhances the model's capacity for feature extraction and cross-class adaptation, while concurrently reducing computational overhead.In order to further enhance the extraction of vulnerability features, an adaptive fusion module is proposed in this paper, which aims to strengthen the interaction and fusion of feature information.The experimental results demonstrate that the STip model attains an average F1 value detection score of 91.16% for the four vulnerabilities without disclosing the original smart contract data. To validate the viability of the proposed lightweight migration approach, the student model is deployed in a migration learning task targeting a novel vulnerability type, resulting in an accuracy of 91.02% and an F1 score of 90.46%. To the best of our knowledge, AF-STip is the inaugural model to apply data-free knowledge migration to smart contract vulnerability detection. While markedly reducing the computational overhead, the method still demonstrates exceptional performance in detecting novel vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) trains models in a collaborative and privacy-preserving manner while removing model centralization risks and improving communication bottlenecks. However, DFL faces challenges in efficient communication management and model aggregation within decentralized environments, especially with heterogeneous data distributions. Thus, this paper introduces ProFe, a novel communication optimization algorithm for DFL that combines knowledge distillation, prototype learning, and quantization techniques. ProFe utilizes knowledge from large local models to train smaller ones for aggregation, incorporates prototypes to better learn unseen classes, and applies quantization to reduce data transmitted during communication rounds. The performance of ProFe has been validated and compared to the literature by using benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Results showed that the proposed algorithm reduces communication costs by up to ~40-50% while maintaining or improving model performance. In addition, it adds ~20% training time due to increased complexity, generating a trade-off.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Federated Domain Generalization with Label Smoothing and Balanced Decentralized Training (FedSB), to address the challenges of data heterogeneity within a federated learning framework. FedSB utilizes label smoothing at the client level to prevent overfitting to domain-specific features, thereby enhancing generalization capabilities across diverse domains when aggregating local models into a global model. Additionally, FedSB incorporates a decentralized budgeting mechanism which balances training among clients, which is shown to improve the performance of the aggregated global model. Extensive experiments on four commonly used multi-domain datasets, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and TerraInc, demonstrate that FedSB outperforms competing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on three out of four datasets, indicating the effectiveness of FedSB in addressing data heterogeneity.

总结:<br />
针对半分布式联邦学习（SD-FL）中客户端通信和训练状态动态变化的问题，本文提出了一个名为TRAIL的信任感知客户端调度机制。TRAIL着重考虑了实际场景中的动态挑战，尤其是在边缘服务器和客户端使用不可靠的簇内模型聚合和簇间模型共识训练共享全局模型的框架下。文章首先利用自适应隐藏半马尔可夫模型（AHSMM）评估客户端的通信状态和贡献；接着，为最小化全局训练损失，提出了一项客户端-服务器关联优化问题；并基于收敛分析设计了一种贪心客户端调度算法。实验结果表明，与现有最优基线相比，TRAIL在真实数据集上的测试精度提高了8.7%，训练损失降低了15.3%。 <div>

Abstract: Due to the sensitivity of data, federated learning (FL) is employed to enable distributed machine learning while safeguarding data privacy and accommodating the requirements of various devices. However, in the context of semi-decentralized federated learning (SD-FL), clients' communication and training states are dynamic. This variability arises from local training fluctuations, heterogeneous data distributions, and intermittent client participation. Most existing studies primarily focus on stable client states, neglecting the dynamic challenges present in real-world scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose a trust-aware client scheduling mechanism (TRAIL) that assesses client states and contributions, enhancing model training efficiency through selective client participation. Our focus is on a semi-decentralized federated learning framework where edge servers and clients train a shared global model using unreliable intra-cluster model aggregation and inter-cluster model consensus. First, we develop an adaptive hidden semi-Markov model (AHSMM) to estimate clients' communication states and contributions. Next, we address a client-server association optimization problem to minimize global training loss. Using convergence analysis, we propose a greedy client scheduling algorithm. Finally, our experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an improvement of 8.7\% in test accuracy and a reduction of 15.3\% in training loss.

arXiv:2412.11674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy preserving machine learning paradigm designed to collaboratively learn a global model without data leakage. Specifically, in a typical FL system, the central server solely functions as an coordinator to iteratively aggregate the collected local models trained by each client, potentially introducing single-point transmission bottleneck and security threats. To mitigate this issue, decentralized federated learning (DFL) has been proposed, where all participating clients engage in peer-to-peer communication without a central server. Nonetheless, DFL still suffers from training degradation as FL does due to the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) nature of client data. And incorporating personalization layers into DFL may be the most effective solutions to alleviate the side effects caused by non-IID data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel unit representation aided personalized decentralized federated learning framework, named UA-PDFL, to deal with the non-IID challenge in DFL. By adaptively adjusting the level of personalization layers through the guidance of the unit representation, UA-PDFL is able to address the varying degrees of data skew. Based on this scheme, client-wise dropout and layer-wise personalization are proposed to further enhance the learning performance of DFL. Extensive experiments empirically prove the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Mean field games and controls involve guiding the behavior of large populations of interacting agents, where each individual's influence on the group is negligible but collectively impacts overall dynamics. Hybrid systems integrate continuous dynamics with discrete transitions, effectively modeling the complex interplay between continuous flows and instantaneous jumps in a unified framework. This paper formulates mean field game and control strategies for switching hybrid systems and proposes computational methods to solve the resulting integro-partial differential equation. This approach enables scalable, decentralized decision-making in large-scale switching systems, which is illustrated through numerical examples in an emergency evacuation scenario with sudden changes in the surrounding environment.

Abstract: Solana has quickly emerged as a popular platform for building decentralized applications (DApps), such as marketplaces for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). A key reason for its success are Solana's low transaction fees and high performance, which is achieved in part due to its stateless programming model. Although the literature features extensive tooling support for smart contract security, current solutions are largely tailored for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Unfortunately, the very stateless nature of Solana's execution environment introduces novel attack patterns specific to Solana requiring a rethinking for building vulnerability analysis methods.
  In this paper, we address this gap and propose FuzzDelSol, the first binary-only coverage-guided fuzzing architecture for Solana smart contracts. FuzzDelSol faithfully models runtime specifics such as smart contract interactions. Moreover, since source code is not available for the large majority of Solana contracts, FuzzDelSol operates on the contract's binary code. Hence, due to the lack of semantic information, we carefully extracted low-level program and state information to develop a diverse set of bug oracles covering all major bug classes in Solana. Our extensive evaluation on 6049 smart contracts shows that FuzzDelSol's bug oracles find bugs with a high precision and recall. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest evaluation of the security landscape on the Solana mainnet.

Abstract: Metaverse technologies demand accurate, real-time, and immersive modeling on consumer-grade hardware for both non-human perception (e.g., drone/robot/autonomous car navigation) and immersive technologies like AR/VR, requiring both structural accuracy and photorealism. However, there exists a knowledge gap in how to apply geometric reconstruction and photorealism modeling (novel view synthesis) in a unified framework. To address this gap and promote the development of robust and immersive modeling and rendering with consumer-grade devices, we propose a real-world Multi-Sensor Hybrid Room Dataset (MuSHRoom). Our dataset presents exciting challenges and requires state-of-the-art methods to be cost-effective, robust to noisy data and devices, and can jointly learn 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis instead of treating them as separate tasks, making them ideal for real-world applications. We benchmark several famous pipelines on our dataset for joint 3D mesh reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Our dataset and benchmark show great potential in promoting the improvements for fusing 3D reconstruction and high-quality rendering in a robust and computationally efficient end-to-end fashion.

Abstract: In the context of advancing 6G, a substantial paradigm shift is anticipated, highlighting comprehensive everything-to-everything interactions characterized by numerous connections and stringent adherence to Quality of Service/Experience (QoS/E) prerequisites. The imminent challenge stems from resource scarcity, prompting a deliberate transition to Computing-Network Convergence (CNC) as an auspicious approach for joint resource orchestration. While CNC-based mechanisms have garnered attention, their effectiveness in realizing future services, particularly in use cases like the Metaverse, may encounter limitations due to the continually changing nature of users, services, and resources. Hence, this paper presents the concept of Adaptable CNC (ACNC) as an autonomous Machine Learning (ML)-aided mechanism crafted for the joint orchestration of computing and network resources, catering to dynamic and voluminous user requests with stringent requirements. ACNC encompasses two primary functionalities: state recognition and context detection. Given the intricate nature of the user-service-computing-network space, the paper employs dimension reduction to generate live, holistic, abstract system states in a hierarchical structure. To address the challenges posed by dynamic changes, Continual Learning (CL) is employed, classifying the system state into contexts controlled by dedicated ML agents, enabling them to operate efficiently. These two functionalities are intricately linked within a closed loop overseen by the End-to-End (E2E) orchestrator to allocate resources. The paper introduces the components of ACNC, proposes a Metaverse scenario to exemplify ACNC's role in resource provisioning with Segment Routing v6 (SRv6), outlines ACNC's workflow, details a numerical analysis for efficiency assessment, and concludes with discussions on relevant challenges and potential avenues for future research.

<br /><br />总结:
本文提出了一种新的[n,k,d]块循环码家族，该码结构由多个局部码[$n_0 \ll n$, $k_0 \ll k$, $d_0$]组成，满足三个特性：(1) 支持分布式擦除解码；(2) 可通过参数调整将最小距离$d$放大至超过$d_0$；(3) 适用于基于密码学承诺方案的低复杂度代码符号验证。这些特性使其成为解决区块链网络中数据可用性问题的理想选择。相较于目前使用的二维Reed-Solomon (RS) 码，这种新码在高码率情况下能在保持给定速率(k/n)的同时，实现较大的相对最小距离(d/n)。

设计过程分为两步：首先，构建了线性依赖关系结构，即块循环拓扑$T_{[\mu,\lambda,\omega]}(\rho)$，其中包含$\mu$个受$\rho$个奇偶校验约束的局部码，各局部码间的符号集合以均匀模式相交，由重叠因子$\lambda$和重叠宽度$\omega$决定。接着，具体化拓扑结构，构造块循环码${\cal C}_{\text{BC}}[\mu,\lambda,\omega,\rho]$，每个局部码为$[\lambda\omega+\rho,\lambda\omega,\rho+1]$的广义RS码。该块循环码有$n=\mu(\rho+\omega)$，$k=\mu\omega$，并证明在一定条件下，其最小距离$d=\lambda\rho+1$。当$\lambda=2$时，可证得$d=2\rho+1$，并提出了一个高效的并行化擦除纠正解码器，当存在不多于$2\rho$个擦除时，能完全恢复原始编码信息。该解码器利用一种新颖的解码机制，通过迭代从一对局部码中恢复擦除的信息。 <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we design a family of $[n,k,d]$ block circulant codes that consist of many $[n_0 \ll n,k_0 \ll k,d_0]$ local codes and that satisfy three properties: (1) the code supports distributed erasure decoding, (2) $d$ can be scaled above $d_0$ by a given parameter, and (3) it is amenable to low complexity verification of code symbols using a cryptographic commitment scheme. These properties make the code ideal for use in protocols that address the data availability problem in blockchain networks. Moreover, the code outperforms the currently used 2D Reed-Solomon (RS) code with a larger relative minimum distance $(d/n)$, as desired in the protocol, for a given rate $(k/n)$ in the high-rate regime.
  The code is designed in two steps. First, we develop the topology, i.e., the structure of linear dependence relations among code symbols, and define it as the block circulant topology $T_{[\mu,\lambda,\omega]}(\rho)$. In this topology, there are $\mu$ local codes, each constrained by $\rho$ parity checks. The set of symbols of a local code intersects with another in a uniform pattern, determined by two parameters, namely the overlap factor $\lambda$ and the overlap width $\omega$. Next, we instantiate the topology, i.e., to specify the coefficients of linear dependence relations, to construct the block circulant codes ${\cal C}_{\text{BC}}[\mu,\lambda,\omega,\rho]$. Every local code is a $[\lambda\omega+\rho,\lambda\omega,\rho+1]$ generalized RS code. The block circulant code has $n=\mu(\rho+\omega)$, $k=\mu\omega$ and we show that $d=\lambda\rho+1$ under certain conditions. For $\lambda=2$, we prove that $d=2\rho+1$ always, and provide an efficient, parallelizable erasure-correcting decoder that fully recovers the codeword when there are $\leq 2\rho$ erasures. The decoder uses a novel decoding mechanism that iteratively recovers erasures from pairs of local codes.

Abstract: Blockchain data analysis is essential for deriving insights, tracking transactions, identifying patterns, and ensuring the integrity and security of decentralized networks. It plays a key role in various areas, such as fraud detection, regulatory compliance, smart contract auditing, and decentralized finance (DeFi) risk management. However, existing blockchain data analysis tools face challenges, including data scarcity, the lack of generalizability, and the lack of reasoning capability.
  We believe large language models (LLMs) can mitigate these challenges; however, we have not seen papers discussing LLM integration in blockchain data analysis in a comprehensive and systematic way. This paper systematically explores potential techniques and design patterns in LLM-integrated blockchain data analysis. We also outline prospective research opportunities and challenges, emphasizing the need for further exploration in this promising field. This paper aims to benefit a diverse audience spanning academia, industry, and policy-making, offering valuable insights into the integration of LLMs in blockchain data analysis.

<div> 关键词：TransferLight、交通信号控制、道路网络、通用性、图神经网络<br /><br />总结：<br />
TransferLight是一个针对交通信号控制的创新框架，旨在实现对不同道路网络、多样化的交通条件和交叉口几何形状的强泛化能力。其核心采用了一个基于log-distance奖励函数，提供空间感知的信号优先级并能适应各种车道配置，克服了传统压力奖励方法的局限。该框架利用层次化、异质性和有向的图神经网络架构，精确捕捉细粒度的交通动态，保证了对任意交叉口布局的可转移性。通过采用分散式多智能体方法、全局奖励和新颖的状态转移先验，TransferLight构建了一个无需重训练即可零样本扩展到任何道路网络的单权重共享策略。此外，通过训练过程中的领域随机化进一步提升了模型的泛化能力。实验结果证明了TransferLight在未见过的场景中表现出优越性能，为满足城市交通日益变化的需求推进了实用且具有泛化的智能交通系统的发展。 <div>

Abstract: Traffic signal control plays a crucial role in urban mobility. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize beyond their training environments to unseen scenarios with varying traffic dynamics. We present TransferLight, a novel framework designed for robust generalization across road-networks, diverse traffic conditions and intersection geometries. At its core, we propose a log-distance reward function, offering spatially-aware signal prioritization while remaining adaptable to varied lane configurations - overcoming the limitations of traditional pressure-based rewards. Our hierarchical, heterogeneous, and directed graph neural network architecture effectively captures granular traffic dynamics, enabling transferability to arbitrary intersection layouts. Using a decentralized multi-agent approach, global rewards, and novel state transition priors, we develop a single, weight-tied policy that scales zero-shot to any road network without re-training. Through domain randomization during training, we additionally enhance generalization capabilities. Experimental results validate TransferLight's superior performance in unseen scenarios, advancing practical, generalizable intelligent transportation systems to meet evolving urban traffic demands.

Abstract: Digital healthcare systems have revolutionized medical services, facilitating provider collaboration, enhancing diagnosis, and optimizing and improving treatments. They deliver superior quality, faster, reliable, and cost-effective services. Researchers are addressing pressing health challenges by integrating information technology, computing resources, and digital health records. However, digitizing healthcare introduces significant risks to patient data privacy and security, with the potential for unauthorized access to protected health information. Although patients can authorize data access through consent, there is a pressing need for mechanisms to ensure such given consent is informed and executed properly and timely. Patients deserve transparency and accountability regarding the access to their data: who access it, when, and under what circumstances. Current healthcare systems, often centralized, leave much to be desired in managing these concerns, leading to numerous security incidents. To address these issues, we propose a system based on blockchain and smart contracts for managing informed consent for accessing health records by the treatment team members, incorporating safeguards to verify that consent processes are correctly executed. Blockchain's inherent immutability ensures the integrity of consent. Smart contracts automatically execute agreements, enhancing accountability. They provide a robust framework for protecting patient privacy in the digital age. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach can be integrated easily with the existing healthcare systems without incurring financial and technological challenges.

总结:
本文介绍了针对智能合约（SC）安全性的研究，其中智能合约在以太坊区块链上处理价值数百万美元的交易，因而成为黑客利用漏洞窃取资金的目标。为了评估检测SC漏洞的各种工具的效果，需要一个带标签的SC漏洞数据集。现有的SC数据集存在局限性，如覆盖的漏洞场景有限和标签错误。为填补这一空白，文章提出了名为SCRUBD的新数据集，该数据集包括真实世界SC和合成SC，并对其进行了RE和UX漏洞的手动标记。实证研究表明，Slither在基于众包标注的数据集上检测RE漏洞的表现优于其他工具，而Sailfish则在人工合成的数据集中对于RE漏洞检测表现最佳。对于UX漏洞，Slither同样表现出超越其他工具的检测能力。 <div>

Abstract: Smart Contracts (SCs) handle transactions in the Ethereum blockchain worth millions of United States dollars, making them a lucrative target for attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities and steal funds. The Ethereum community has developed a rich set of tools to detect vulnerabilities in SCs, including reentrancy (RE) and unhandled exceptions (UX). A dataset of SCs labelled with vulnerabilities is needed to evaluate the tools' efficacy. Existing SC datasets with labelled vulnerabilities have limitations, such as covering only a limited range of vulnerability scenarios and containing incorrect labels. As a result, there is a lack of a standardized dataset to compare the performances of these tools. SCRUBD aims to fill this gap. We present a dataset of real-world SCs and synthesized SCs labelled with RE and UX. The real-world SC dataset is labelled through crowdsourcing, followed by manual inspection by an expert, and covers both RE and UX vulnerabilities. On the other hand, the synthesized dataset is carefully crafted to cover various RE scenarios only. Using SCRUBD we compared the performance of six popular vulnerability detection tools. Based on our study, we found that Slither outperforms other tools on a crowdsourced dataset in detecting RE vulnerabilities, while Sailfish outperforms other tools on a manually synthesized dataset for detecting RE. For UX vulnerabilities, Slither outperforms all other tools.

Abstract: We consider a variant of the target defense problems where a group of defenders are tasked to simultaneously capture an intruder. The intruder's objective is to reach a target without being simultaneously captured by the defender team. Some of the defenders are sensing-limited and do not have any information regarding the intruder's position or velocity at any time. The defenders may communicate with each other using a connected communication graph. We propose a decentralized feedback strategy for the defenders, which transforms the simultaneous capture problem into a unique nonlinear consensus problem. We derive a sufficient condition for simultaneous capture in terms of the agents' speeds, sensing, and communication capabilities. The proposed decentralized controller is evaluated through extensive numerical simulations.

Abstract: Two substantial technological advances have reshaped the public square in recent decades: first with the advent of the internet and second with the recent introduction of large language models (LLMs). LLMs offer opportunities for a paradigm shift towards more decentralized, participatory online spaces that can be used to facilitate deliberative dialogues at scale, but also create risks of exacerbating societal schisms. Here, we explore four applications of LLMs to improve digital public squares: collective dialogue systems, bridging systems, community moderation, and proof-of-humanity systems. Building on the input from over 70 civil society experts and technologists, we argue that LLMs both afford promising opportunities to shift the paradigm for conversations at scale and pose distinct risks for digital public squares. We lay out an agenda for future research and investments in AI that will strengthen digital public squares and safeguard against potential misuses of AI.

Abstract: Security concerns in large-scale networked environments are becoming increasingly critical. To further improve the algorithm security from the design perspective of decentralized optimization algorithms, we introduce a new measure: Privacy Leakage Frequency (PLF), which reveals the relationship between communication and privacy leakage of algorithms, showing that lower PLF corresponds to lower privacy budgets. Based on such assertion, a novel differentially private decentralized primal--dual algorithm named DP-RECAL is proposed to take advantage of operator splitting method and relay communication mechanism to experience less PLF so as to reduce the overall privacy budget. To the best of our knowledge, compared with existing differentially private algorithms, DP-RECAL presents superior privacy performance and communication complexity. In addition, with uncoordinated network-independent stepsizes, we prove the convergence of DP-RECAL for general convex problems and establish a linear convergence rate under the metric subregularity. Evaluation analysis on least squares problem and numerical experiments on real-world datasets verify our theoretical results and demonstrate that DP-RECAL can defend some classical gradient leakage attacks.

Abstract: In response to the growing demand for enhanced performance and power efficiency, the semiconductor industry has witnessed a paradigm shift toward heterogeneous integration, giving rise to 2.5D/3D chips. These chips incorporate diverse chiplets, manufactured globally and integrated into a single chip. Securing these complex 2.5D/3D integrated circuits (ICs) presents a formidable challenge due to inherent trust issues within the semiconductor supply chain. Chiplets produced in untrusted locations may be susceptible to tampering, introducing malicious circuits that could compromise sensitive information. This paper introduces an innovative approach that leverages blockchain technology to establish traceability for ICs and chiplets throughout the supply chain. Given that chiplet manufacturers are dispersed globally and may operate within different blockchain consortiums, ensuring the integrity of data within each blockchain ledger becomes imperative. To address this, we propose a novel dual-layer approach for establishing distributed trust across diverse blockchain ledgers. The lower layer comprises of a blockchain-based framework for IC supply chain provenance that enables transactions between blockchain instances run by different consortiums, making it possible to trace the complete provenance DAG of each IC. The upper layer implements a multi-chain reputation scheme that assigns reputation scores to entities while specifically accounting for high-risk transactions that cross blockchain trust zones. This approach enhances the credibility of the blockchain data, mitigating potential risks associated with the use of multiple consortiums and ensuring a robust foundation for securing 2.5D/3D ICs in the evolving landscape of heterogeneous integration.

Abstract: Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a generalization of public-key encryption that enables fine-grained access control in cloud services. Recently, Hohenberger et al. (Eurocrypt 2023) introduced the notion of registered ABE, which is an ABE scheme without a trusted central authority. Instead, users generate their own public/secret keys and then register their keys and attributes with a key curator. The key curator is a transparent and untrusted entity and its behavior needs to be audited for malicious registration. In addition, pairing-based registered ABE still suffers the heavy decryption overhead like ABE. A general approach to address this issue is to outsource decryption to a decryption cloud service (DCS). In this work, we propose BA-ORABE, the first fully auditable registered ABE with reliable outsource decryption scheme based on blockchain. First, we utilize a verifiable tag mechanism to achieve verifiability of ciphertext transformation, and the exemptibility which enables the honest DCS to escape from wrong claims is guaranteed by zero knowledge fraud proof under optimistic assumption. Additionally, our system achieves fairness and decentralized outsourcing to protect the interests of all parties and the registration and outsourcing process are transparent and fully auditable through blockchain. Finally, we give formal security analysis and implement and evaluate our scheme on Ethereum to demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency.

Abstract: We study decentralized multiagent optimization over networks, modeled as undirected graphs. The optimization problem consists of minimizing a nonconvex smooth function plus a convex extended-value function, which enforces constraints or extra structure on the solution (e.g., sparsity, low-rank). We further assume that the objective function satisfies the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property, with given exponent $\theta\in [0,1)$. The KL property is satisfied by several (nonconvex) functions of practical interest, e.g., arising from machine learning applications; in the centralized setting, it permits to achieve strong convergence guarantees. Here we establish convergence of the same type for the notorious decentralized gradient-tracking-based algorithm SONATA. Specifically, $\textbf{(i)}$ when $\theta\in (0,1/2]$, the sequence generated by SONATA converges to a stationary solution of the problem at R-linear rate;$ \textbf{(ii)} $when $\theta\in (1/2,1)$, sublinear rate is certified; and finally $\textbf{(iii)}$ when $\theta=0$, the iterates will either converge in a finite number of steps or converges at R-linear rate. This matches the convergence behavior of centralized proximal-gradient algorithms except when $\theta=0$. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for privacy-preserving model training across decentralized devices. However, it faces challenges such as statistical heterogeneity and susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which can impact model robustness and fairness. Personalized FL attempts to provide some relief by customizing models for individual clients. However, it falls short in addressing server-side aggregation vulnerabilities. We introduce a novel method called \textbf{FedAA}, which optimizes client contributions via \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{A}ggregation to enhance model robustness against malicious clients and ensure fairness across participants in non-identically distributed settings. To achieve this goal, we propose an approach involving a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient-based algorithm for continuous control of aggregation weights, an innovative client selection method based on model parameter distances, and a reward mechanism guided by validation set performance. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate that, in terms of robustness, \textbf{FedAA} outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining comparable levels of fairness, offering a promising solution to build resilient and fair federated systems.

本文提出了第三种开发和分布前沿模型的方法——协议学习，它通过激励参与者的分布式网络进行训练，有望聚合比任何单一中央实体高出几个数量级的计算资源。然而，这也带来了新的挑战，如异构、不可靠的节点、恶意参与者以及需要保护激励机制的不可提取模型等问题，特别是“无关闭问题”，即无法单方面停止集体训练的模型。文章回顾了近期的技术进展，表明去中心化训练可能是可行的，涉及新兴的通信效率策略和容错方法，同时指出了仍存在的关键开放问题。与认为去中心化会放大前沿风险的观点相反，文章认为协议学习的透明性、分布式治理和民主化的访问权限实际上可以降低这些风险，相比当前集中式体制更具优势。 <div>

Abstract: Frontier models are currently developed and distributed primarily through two channels: centralized proprietary APIs or open-sourcing of pre-trained weights. We identify a third paradigm - Protocol Learning - where models are trained across decentralized networks of incentivized participants. This approach has the potential to aggregate orders of magnitude more computational resources than any single centralized entity, enabling unprecedented model scales and capabilities. However, it also introduces novel challenges: heterogeneous and unreliable nodes, malicious participants, the need for unextractable models to preserve incentives, and complex governance dynamics. To date, no systematic analysis has been conducted to assess the feasibility of Protocol Learning or the associated risks, particularly the 'No-Off Problem' arising from the inability to unilaterally halt a collectively trained model. We survey recent technical advances that suggest decentralized training may be feasible - covering emerging communication-efficient strategies and fault-tolerant methods - while highlighting critical open problems that remain. Contrary to the notion that decentralization inherently amplifies frontier risks, we argue that Protocol Learning's transparency, distributed governance, and democratized access ultimately reduce these risks compared to today's centralized regimes.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative learning among decentralized clients while safeguarding the privacy of their local data. Existing studies on FL typically assume offline labeled data available at each client when the training starts. Nevertheless, the training data in practice often arrive at clients in a streaming fashion without ground-truth labels. Given the expensive annotation cost, it is critical to identify a subset of informative samples for labeling on clients. However, selecting samples locally while accommodating the global training objective presents a challenge unique to FL. In this work, we tackle this conundrum by framing the data querying process in FL as a collaborative decentralized decision-making problem and proposing an effective solution named LeaDQ, which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. In particular, under the implicit guidance from global information, LeaDQ effectively learns the local policies for distributed clients and steers them towards selecting samples that can enhance the global model's accuracy. Extensive simulations on image and text tasks show that LeaDQ advances the model performance in various FL scenarios, outperforming the benchmarking algorithms.

<br /><br />总结:

本文提出了一个基于Maude形式化方法的分布式重配置语言Concerto-D的概述。相较于相关工作，Concerto-D在两个方面有所改进：一是通过实现大量局部重配置计划的去中心化协调，避免了在网络不稳定（如边缘计算或Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)）环境中出现单点故障的问题；二是使用Maude为该语言提供了机械化的形式语义，从而保证了其执行的正确性。文章中，通过一个来源于实际CPS案例研究的重配置示例来说明Concerto-D语言及其语义。由于Maude是一种基于重写逻辑的正式规范语言，因此非常适合描述并发模型。 <div>

Abstract: We propose an overview of the decentralized reconfiguration language Concerto-D through its Maude formalization. Concerto-D extends the already published Concerto language. Concerto-D improves on two different parameters compared with related work: the decentralized coordination of numerous local reconfiguration plans which avoid a single point of failure when considering unstable networks such as edge computing, or cyber-physical systems (CPS) for instance; and a mechanized formal semantics of the language with Maude which offers guarantees on the executability of the semantics. Throughout the paper, the Concerto-D language and its semantics are exemplified with a reconfiguration extracted from a real case study on a CPS. We rely on the Maude formal specification language, which is based on rewriting logic, and consequently perfectly suited for describing a concurrent model.

Abstract: As decentralized applications on permissionless blockchains are prevalent, more and more latency-sensitive usage scenarios emerged, where the lower the latency of sending and receiving messages, the better the chance of earning revenue. To reduce latency, we present Pioplat, a feasible, customizable, and low-cost latency reduction framework consisting of multiple relay nodes on different continents and at least one instrumented variant of a full node. The node selection strategy of Pioplat and the low-latency communication protocol offer an elastic way to reduce latency effectively. We demonstrate Pioplat's feasibility with an implementation running on five continents and show that Pioplat can significantly reduce the latency of receiving blocks/transactions and sending transactions, thus fulfilling the requirements of most latency-sensitive use cases. Furthermore, we provide the complete implementation of Pioplat to promote further research and allow people to apply the framework to more blockchain systems.

<div> 关键词: 图神经网络, 边对抗攻击, 防御策略, 图代理网络, 分布式交互

总结:
本文针对图神经网络(GNNs)在全球优化端到端训练中易受边对抗攻击的问题，提出了一个新的防御模型——图代理网络(GAgN)。GAgN中的每个节点被视为具有1跳视图的代理，通过代理间的分布式交互，它们能够学习推断全局感知并执行包括节点嵌入、度数和邻居关系在内的任务，从而使节点具备过滤敌对边的能力并在执行分类任务时保持鲁棒性。此外，由于代理人具有有限视野，恶意消息无法在全球范围内传播，从而抵抗基于全局优化的次级攻击。理论证明单隐藏层多层感知机(MLPs)足以实现这些功能。实验结果显示，相比于现有最先进的防御方法，GAgN在被扰动的数据集上实现了最优的分类精度。 <div>

Abstract: End-to-end training with global optimization have popularized graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification, yet inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities to adversarial edge-perturbing attacks. Adversaries can exploit the inherent opened interfaces of GNNs' input and output, perturbing critical edges and thus manipulating the classification results. Current defenses, due to their persistent utilization of global-optimization-based end-to-end training schemes, inherently encapsulate the vulnerabilities of GNNs. This is specifically evidenced in their inability to defend against targeted secondary attacks. In this paper, we propose the Graph Agent Network (GAgN) to address the aforementioned vulnerabilities of GNNs. GAgN is a graph-structured agent network in which each node is designed as an 1-hop-view agent. Through the decentralized interactions between agents, they can learn to infer global perceptions to perform tasks including inferring embeddings, degrees and neighbor relationships for given nodes. This empowers nodes to filtering adversarial edges while carrying out classification tasks. Furthermore, agents' limited view prevents malicious messages from propagating globally in GAgN, thereby resisting global-optimization-based secondary attacks. We prove that single-hidden-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are theoretically sufficient to achieve these functionalities. Experimental results show that GAgN effectively implements all its intended capabilities and, compared to state-of-the-art defenses, achieves optimal classification accuracy on the perturbed datasets.

Abstract: Blockchain smart contracts have emerged as a transformative force in the digital realm, spawning a diverse range of compelling applications. Since solidity smart contracts across various domains manage trillions of dollars in virtual coins, they become a prime target for attacks. One of the primary challenges is keeping abreast of the latest techniques and tools for developing secure smart contracts and examining those already deployed. In this paper, we seek to address these challenges from four aspects: (1) We begin by examining ten automatic tools, specifically focusing on their methodologies and their ability to identify vulnerabilities in solidity smart contracts. (2) We propose a novel criterion for evaluating these tools, based on the ISO/IEC 25010 standard. (3) To facilitate the evaluation of the selected tools, we construct a benchmark that encompasses two distinct datasets: a collection of 389 labelled smart contracts and a scaled set of 20,000 unique cases from real-world contracts. (4) We provide a comparison of the selected tools, offering insights into their strengths and weaknesses and highlighting areas where further improvements are needed. Through this evaluation, we hope to provide developers and researchers with valuable guidance on selecting and using smart contract analysis tools and contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve the security and reliability of smart contracts.

Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning, centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) methods typically assume that agents make decisions based on their local observations independently, which may not lead to a correlated joint policy with coordination. Coordination can be explicitly encouraged during training and individual policies can be trained to imitate the correlated joint policy. However, this may lead to an \textit{asymmetric learning failure} due to the observation mismatch between the joint and individual policies. Inspired by the concept of correlated equilibrium, we introduce a \textit{strategy modification} called AgentMixer that allows agents to correlate their policies. AgentMixer combines individual partially observable policies into a joint fully observable policy non-linearly. To enable decentralized execution, we introduce \textit{Individual-Global-Consistency} to guarantee mode consistency during joint training of the centralized and decentralized policies and prove that AgentMixer converges to an $\epsilon$-approximate Correlated Equilibrium. In the Multi-Agent MuJoCo, SMAC-v2, Matrix Game, and Predator-Prey benchmarks, AgentMixer outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods.

<div> 关键词：decentralized online convex optimization (D-OCO)，regret bounds，convex函数，strongly convex函数，communication matrix

总结:

本文研究了分布式在线凸优化(D-OCO)问题，其中一组本地学习者仅使用局部计算和通信来最小化全局损失函数序列。先前的研究为凸函数和强凸函数分别建立了$O(n^{5/4}\rho^{-1/2}\sqrt{T})$和${O}(n^{3/2}\rho^{-1}\log T)$的遗憾界限。然而这些界限与已知的下界存在较大差距。为此，本文提出了一种新的D-OCO算法，将凸函数和强凸函数的遗憾界限降低到$\tilde{O}(n\rho^{-1/4}\sqrt{T})$和$\tilde{O}(n\rho^{-1/2}\log T)$。主要技术在于设计一种在线加速的 gossip 策略，实现更快的局部学习者间的平均共识。此外，通过充分利用特定网络拓扑结构的谱性质，进一步增强下界至$\Omega(n\rho^{-1/4}\sqrt{T})$和$\Omega(n\rho^{-1/2}\log T)$。这些结果表明新算法对于凸函数和强凸函数而言，在$T$、$n$和$\rho$上的遗憾性能近乎最优。最后，针对具有复杂约束的实际应用，文章还提出了一种无需投影操作的算法变体。分析表明该变体可以分别达到${O}(nT^{3/4})$和${O}(nT^{2/3}(\log T)^{1/3})$的遗憾界限，以及几乎最优的$\tilde{O}(\rho^{-1/2}\sqrt{T})$和$\tilde{O}(\rho^{-1/2}T^{1/3}(\log T)^{2/3})$通信轮数。 <div>

Abstract: We investigate decentralized online convex optimization (D-OCO), in which a set of local learners are required to minimize a sequence of global loss functions using only local computations and communications. Previous studies have established $O(n^{5/4}\rho^{-1/2}\sqrt{T})$ and ${O}(n^{3/2}\rho^{-1}\log T)$ regret bounds for convex and strongly convex functions respectively, where $n$ is the number of local learners, $\rho<1$ is the spectral gap of the communication matrix, and $T$ is the time horizon. However, there exist large gaps from the existing lower bounds, i.e., $\Omega(n\sqrt{T})$ for convex functions and $\Omega(n)$ for strongly convex functions. To fill these gaps, in this paper, we first develop a novel D-OCO algorithm that can respectively reduce the regret bounds for convex and strongly convex functions to $\tilde{O}(n\rho^{-1/4}\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{O}(n\rho^{-1/2}\log T)$. The primary technique is to design an online accelerated gossip strategy that enjoys a faster average consensus among local learners. Furthermore, by carefully exploiting spectral properties of a specific network topology, we enhance the lower bounds for convex and strongly convex functions to $\Omega(n\rho^{-1/4}\sqrt{T})$ and $\Omega(n\rho^{-1/2}\log T)$, respectively. These results suggest that the regret of our algorithm is nearly optimal in terms of $T$, $n$, and $\rho$ for both convex and strongly convex functions. Finally, we propose a projection-free variant of our algorithm to efficiently handle practical applications with complex constraints. Our analysis reveals that the projection-free variant can achieve ${O}(nT^{3/4})$ and ${O}(nT^{2/3}(\log T)^{1/3})$ regret bounds for convex and strongly convex functions with nearly optimal $\tilde{O}(\rho^{-1/2}\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{O}(\rho^{-1/2}T^{1/3}(\log T)^{2/3})$ communication rounds, respectively.

Abstract: Block-Term Tensor Regression (BTTR) has proven to be a powerful tool for modeling complex, high-dimensional data by leveraging multilinear relationships, making it particularly well-suited for applications in healthcare and neuroscience. However, traditional implementations of BTTR rely on centralized datasets, which pose significant privacy risks and hinder collaboration across institutions. To address these challenges, we introduce Federated Block-Term Tensor Regression (FBTTR), an extension of BTTR designed for federated learning scenarios. FBTTR enables decentralized data analysis, allowing institutions to collaboratively build predictive models while preserving data privacy and complying with regulations.
  FBTTR represents a major step forward in applying tensor regression to federated learning environments. Its performance is evaluated in two case studies: finger movement decoding from Electrocorticography (ECoG) signals and heart disease prediction. In the first case study, using the BCI Competition IV dataset, FBTTR outperforms non-multilinear models, demonstrating superior accuracy in decoding finger movements. For the dataset, for subject 3, the thumb obtained a performance of 0.76 $\pm$ .05 compared to 0.71 $\pm$ 0.05 for centralised BTTR. In the second case study, FBTTR is applied to predict heart disease using real-world clinical datasets, outperforming both standard federated learning approaches and centralized BTTR models. In the Fed-Heart-Disease Dataset, an AUC-ROC was obtained of 0.872 $\pm$ 0.02 and an accuracy of 0.772 $\pm$ 0.02 compared to 0.812 $\pm$ 0.003 and 0.753 $\pm$ 0.007 for the centralized model.

Abstract: Cooperation is vital to our survival and progress. Evolutionary game theory offers a lens to understand the structures and incentives that enable cooperation to be a successful strategy. As artificial intelligence agents become integral to human systems, the dynamics of cooperation take on unprecedented significance. Decentralized frameworks like Web3, grounded in transparency, accountability, and trust, offer a foundation for fostering cooperation by establishing enforceable rules and incentives for humans and AI agents. Guided by our Incentivized Symbiosis model, a paradigm aligning human and AI agent goals through bidirectional incentives and mutual adaptation, we investigate mechanisms for embedding cooperation into human-agent coevolution. We conceptualize Incentivized Symbiosis as part of a contemporary moral framework inspired by Web3 principles, encoded in blockchain technology to define and enforce rules, incentives, and consequences for both humans and AI agents. By integrating these principles into the very architecture of human-agent interactions, Web3 ecosystems catalyze an environment ripe for collaborative innovation. Our study traverses several transformative applications of Incentivized Symbiosis, from decentralized finance to governance and cultural adaptation, illustrating how AI agents can coevolve with humans to forge a trajectory of shared, sustainable progress.

Abstract: State-of-the-art blockchain sharding solutions such as Monoxide, can cause severely imbalanced distribution of transaction (TX) workloads across all blockchain shards due to the deployment policy of their accounts. Imbalanced TX distributions then produce hot shards, in which the cross-shard TXs may experience an unlimited confirmation latency. Thus, how to address the hot-shard issue and how to reduce crossshard TXs become significant challenges of blockchain sharding. Through reviewing the related studies, we find that a crossshard TX protocol that can achieve workload balance among all shards and simultaneously reduce the quantity of crossshard TXs is still absent from the literature. To this end, we propose BrokerChain, which is a cross-shard blockchain protocol dedicated to account-based state sharding. Essentially, BrokerChain exploits fine-grained state partition and account segmentation. We also elaborate on how BrokerChain handles cross-shard TXs through broker accounts. The security issues and other properties of BrokerChain are analyzed rigorously. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations using an opensource blockchain sharding prototype named BlockEmulator. The evaluation results show that BrokerChain outperforms other baselines in terms of transaction throughput, transaction confirmation latency, the queue size of the transaction pool, and workload balance.

总结:
本文针对数据分布中的统计多样性对基于Push-SUM协议的分布式优化带来的负面影响进行了研究。文章提出了一个新的理论框架——Adaptive Weighting Push-SUM协议，该协议是Push-SUM协议的一个泛化形式，其中原始Push-SUM协议为其特例。理论上分析表明，新协议在充分通信条件下，其共识距离的上界可降低至$O(1/N)$，而Push-SUM协议则保持在$O(1)$。此外，将SGD和Momentum SGD应用于新协议，证明了这两个算法在处理统计多样性上的收敛速度为$O(N/T)$，优于Push-SUM协议的$O(Nd/T)$（其中$d$为训练模型的参数大小）。为了应对实际应用中新协议的统计多样性问题，文章还发展了一种源于莫雷au包络的Moreau权重方法，用于近似优化莫雷au包络的距离惩罚。实验验证了Adaptive Weighting Push-SUM协议在深度学习等实际场景下相比Push-SUM协议具有更高的效率。 <div>

Abstract: Statistical diversity is a property of data distribution and can hinder the optimization of a decentralized network. However, the theoretical limitations of the Push-SUM protocol reduce the performance in handling the statistical diversity of optimization algorithms based on it. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically mitigate the negative impact of statistical diversity on decentralized optimization using the Push-SUM protocol. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive Weighting Push-SUM protocol, a theoretical generalization of the original Push-SUM protocol where the latter is a special case of the former. Our theoretical analysis shows that, with sufficient communication, the upper bound on the consensus distance for the new protocol reduces to $O(1/N)$, whereas it remains at $O(1)$ for the Push-SUM protocol. We adopt SGD and Momentum SGD on the new protocol and prove that the convergence rate of these two algorithms to statistical diversity is $O(N/T)$ on the new protocol, while it is $O(Nd/T)$ on the Push-SUM protocol, where $d$ is the parameter size of the training model. To address statistical diversity in practical applications of the new protocol, we develop the Moreau weighting method for its generalized weight matrix definition. This method, derived from the Moreau envelope, is an approximate optimization of the distance penalty of the Moreau envelope. We verify that the Adaptive Weighting Push-SUM protocol is practically more efficient than the Push-SUM protocol via deep learning experiments.

Abstract: Federated learning enables decentralized model training without sharing raw data, preserving data privacy. However, its vulnerability towards critical security threats, such as gradient inversion and model poisoning by malicious clients, remain unresolved. Existing solutions often address these issues separately, sacrificing either system robustness or model accuracy. This work introduces Tazza, a secure and efficient federated learning framework that simultaneously addresses both challenges. By leveraging the permutation equivariance and invariance properties of neural networks via weight shuffling and shuffled model validation, Tazza enhances resilience against diverse poisoning attacks, while ensuring data confidentiality and high model accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations on various datasets and embedded platforms show that Tazza achieves robust defense with up to 6.7x improved computational efficiency compared to alternative schemes, without compromising performance.

This paper presents a scalable, multi-layered blockchain architecture for secure Electronic Health Record (EHR) sharing and drug supply chain management. The proposed framework introduces five distinct layers that enhance system performance, security, and patient-centric access control. By implementing parallelism, the system significantly increases transaction throughput and reduces network traffic. Our solution ensures data integrity, privacy, and interoperability, making it compatible with existing healthcare systems. Experimental results, conducted using the Caliper benchmark, demonstrate notable improvements in transaction throughput and reduced communication overhead. Additionally, the framework provides transparency and real-time drug supply chain monitoring, empowering decision-makers with critical insights.

<div> 关键词：区块链、保险方案、参数化、协作、智能合约

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种结合了参数化和协作元素的基于区块链的保险方案。该方案中，一批投资者（称为盈余提供者）将在智能合约中锁定资金，使得区块链用户能够承保参数化的保险合同。当预定义条件满足时，这些合同将自动触发赔偿。协作体现在生成代币的过程，代币被分配给盈余提供者和投保人，代表其在盈余中的份额并赋予管理决策投票权。该智能合约使用以太坊区块链的高级编程语言Solidity开发，并部署在Sepolia测试网上，数据处理和分析则采用Python进行。此外，还提供了开源代码并指出了主要研究挑战，以便后续研究可以克服这一初步概念验证的局限性。 <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces a blockchain-based insurance scheme that integrates parametric and collaborative elements. A pool of investors, referred to as surplus providers, locks funds in a smart contract, enabling blockchain users to underwrite parametric insurance contracts. These contracts automatically trigger compensation when predefined conditions are met. The collaborative aspect is embodied in the generation of tokens, which are distributed to both surplus providers and policyholders. These tokens represent each participant's share of the surplus and grant voting rights for management decisions. The smart contract is developed in Solidity, a high-level programming language for the Ethereum blockchain, and deployed on the Sepolia testnet, with data processing and analysis conducted using Python. In addition, open-source code is provided and main research challenges are identified, so that further research can be carried out to overcome limitations of this first proof of concept.

Abstract: Permissionless blockchains face considerable challenges due to increasing storage demands, driven by the proliferation of Decentralized Applications (DApps). This paper introduces EC-Chain, a cost-effective storage solution for permissionless blockchains. EC-Chain reduces storage overheads of ledger and state data, which comprise blockchain data. For ledger data, EC-Chain refines existing erasure coding-based storage optimization techniques by incorporating batch encoding and height-based encoding. We also introduce an easy-to-implement dual-trie state management system that enhances state storage and retrieval through state expiry, mining, and creation procedures. To ensure data availability in permissionless environments, EC-Chain introduces a network maintenance scheme tailored for dynamism. Collectively, these contributions allow EC-Chain to provide an effective solution to the storage challenges faced by permissionless blockchains. Our evaluation demonstrates that EC-Chain can achieve a storage reduction of over \(90\%\) compared to native Ethereum Geth.

<div> 关键词：区块链、采纳率、三难困境、共识协议、数字孪生<br /><br />总结：
随着区块链采纳率创历史新高，各类区块链架构应运而生以满足各种应用集成区块链的需求。然而，区块链系统面临三难困境问题，即在扩展性、去中心化和安全性之间难以取得平衡。这一平衡主要由所采用的共识协议决定。由于共识协议针对特定系统条件设计，因此在区块链这种复杂动态的环境下，单一共识协议运行的系统注定会在某些时期遭遇效率低下问题。本文提出的工作是构建基于数字孪生的区块链管理框架的一部分，旨在通过调整共识过程以适应底层系统的条件来解决三难困境问题。具体而言，文章解决了如何从区块链系统中抽取并镜像到其数字孪生体的问题，提出了克服区块链去中心化、异步特性和全局状态同步等基本问题的算法。实验评估了所提算法的鲁棒性。 <div>

Abstract: Blockchain adoption is reaching an all-time high, with a plethora of blockchain architectures being developed to cover the needs of applications eager to integrate blockchain into their operations. However, blockchain systems suffer from the trilemma trade-off problem, which limits their ability to scale without sacrificing essential metrics such as decentralisation and security. The balance of the trilemma trade-off is primarily dictated by the consensus protocol used. Since consensus protocols are designed to function well under specific system conditions, and consequently, due to the blockchain's complex and dynamic nature, systems operating under a single consensus protocol are bound to face periods of inefficiency. The work presented in this paper constitutes part of an effort to design a Digital Twin-based blockchain management framework to balance the trilemma trade-off problem, which aims to adapt the consensus process to fit the conditions of the underlying system. Specifically, this work addresses the problems of extracting the blockchain system and mirroring it in its digital twin by proposing algorithms that overcome the challenges posed by blockchains' decentralised and asynchronous nature and the fundamental problems of global state and synchronisation in such systems. The robustness of the proposed algorithms is experimentally evaluated.

总结:
本文提出了一个名为CONFETTY的新架构，该架构旨在同时保护区块链为基础的PAISs中的机密性和透明性。智能合约用于执行、强制和存储公开交互，而属性基加密技术则用于指定对敏感信息的访问权限。通过对系统进行系统性的威胁模型分析，文章评估了解决方案的安全性，并通过实施原型在不同场景下的性能测试证明了其实用可行性。这为需要保密操作但仍需保持一定程度交易可验证性的场合提供了一种新的解决方案。 <div>
arXiv:2412.05737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain enables novel, trustworthy Process-Aware Information Systems (PAISs) by enforcing the security, robustness, and traceability of operations. In particular, transparency ensures that all information exchanges are openly accessible, fostering trust within the system. Although this is a desirable property to enable notarization and auditing activities, it also represents a limitation for such cases where confidentiality is a requirement since interactions involve sensible data. Current solutions rely on obfuscation techniques or private infrastructures, hindering the enforcing capabilities of smart contracts and the public verifiability of transactions. Against this background, we propose CONFETTY, an architecture for blockchain-based PAISs aimed at preserving both confidentiality and transparency. Smart contracts enact, enforce and store public interactions, while attribute-based encryption techniques are adopted to specify access grants to confidential information. We assess the security of our solution through a systematic threat model analysis and assess its practical feasibility by gauging the performance of our implemented prototype in different scenarios from the literature.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Sarv, a novel non-monolithic blockchain-based data structure designed to represent hierarchical relationships between digitally representable components. Sarv serves as an underlying infrastructure for a wide range of applications requiring hierarchical data management, such as supply chain tracking, asset management, and circular economy implementations. Our approach leverages a tree-based data structure to accurately reflect products and their sub-components, enabling functionalities such as modification, disassembly, borrowing, and refurbishment, mirroring real-world operations. The hierarchy within Sarv is embedded in the on-chain data structure through a smart contract-based design, utilizing Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs). The uniqueness of Sarv lies in its compact and non-monolithic architecture, its mutability, and a two-layer action authorization scheme that enhances security and delegation of asset management. We demonstrate that Sarv addresses real-world requirements by providing a scalable, mutable, and secure solution for managing hierarchical data on the blockchain.

arXiv:2412.06105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for developing scalable, decentralized artificial intelligence in large-scale networked systems, such as wireless networks, power grids, and transportation networks. Currently, GNNs in networked systems mostly follow a paradigm of `centralized training, distributed execution', which limits their adaptability and slows down their development cycles. In this work, we fill this gap for the first time by developing a communication-efficient, fully distributed online training approach for GNNs applied to large networked systems. For a mini-batch with $B$ samples, our approach of training an $L$-layer GNN only adds $L$ rounds of message passing to the $LB$ rounds required by GNN inference, with doubled message sizes. Through numerical experiments in graph-based node regression, power allocation, and link scheduling in wireless networks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in training GNNs under supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning paradigms.

arXiv:2412.06157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized machine learning approach where clients train models locally and share model updates to develop a global model. This enables low-resource devices to collaboratively build a high-quality model without requiring direct access to the raw training data. However, despite only sharing model updates, federated learning still faces several privacy vulnerabilities. One of the key threats is membership inference attacks, which target clients' privacy by determining whether a specific example is part of the training set. These attacks can compromise sensitive information in real-world applications, such as medical diagnoses within a healthcare system. Although there has been extensive research on membership inference attacks, a comprehensive and up-to-date survey specifically focused on it within federated learning is still absent. To fill this gap, we categorize and summarize membership inference attacks and their corresponding defense strategies based on their characteristics in this setting. We introduce a unique taxonomy of existing attack research and provide a systematic overview of various countermeasures. For these studies, we thoroughly analyze the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches. Finally, we identify and discuss key future research directions for readers interested in advancing the field.

Abstract: 5G networks provide secure and reliable information transmission services for the Internet of Everything, thus paving the way for 6G networks, which is anticipated to be an AI-based network, supporting unprecedented intelligence across applications. Abundant computing resources will establish the 6G Computing Power Network (CPN) to facilitate ubiquitous intelligent services. In this article, we propose BECS, a computing sharing mechanism based on evolutionary algorithm and blockchain, designed to balance task offloading among user devices, edge devices, and cloud resources within 6G CPN, thereby enhancing the computing resource utilization. We model computing sharing as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to improve resource utilization while balancing other issues. To tackle this NP-hard problem, we devise a kernel distance-based dominance relation and incorporated it into the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III, significantly enhancing the diversity of the evolutionary population. In addition, we propose a pseudonym scheme based on zero-knowledge proof to protect the privacy of users participating in computing sharing. Finally, the security analysis and simulation results demonstrate that BECS can fully and effectively utilize all computing resources in 6G CPN, significantly improving the computing resource utilization while protecting user privacy.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have unlocked numerous applications, including environmental monitoring, disaster response, and agricultural surveying. Enhancing the collective behavior of multiple decentralized UAVs can significantly improve these applications through more efficient and coordinated operations. In this study, we explore a Recurrent PPO model for target localization in perceptually degraded environments like places without GNSS/GPS signals. We first developed a single-drone approach for target identification, followed by a decentralized two-drone model. Our approach can utilize two types of sensors on the UAVs, a detection sensor and a target signal sensor. The single-drone model achieved an accuracy of 93%, while the two-drone model achieved an accuracy of 86%, with the latter requiring fewer average steps to locate the target. This demonstrates the potential of our method in UAV swarms, offering efficient and effective localization of radiant targets in complex environmental conditions.

Abstract: Due to the rapid development of quantum computing, many classical blockchain technologies are now considered insecure. The emergence of quantum blockchain holds promise for addressing this issue. Various quantum consensus algorithms have been proposed so far, but there has not yet been a quantum consensus algorithm tailored specifically for consortium blockchain scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum consensus mechanism, named Q-PnV. This consensus mechanism is based on the classical Proof of Vote (PoV), integrating quantum voting, quantum digital signature and quantum random number generators (QRNGs). By combining Q-PnV with a quantum blockchain using weighted hypergraph states, we propose a comprehensive quantum blockchain solution for consortium blockchain scenarios. Compared to the classical method, the quantum blockchain based on Q-PnV can resist quantum attacks and shows significant improvements in security and fairness, making it better suit-ed for the future quantum era.

Abstract: Protecting integrated circuits (ICs) from piracy and theft throughout their lifecycle is a persistent and complex challenge. In order to safeguard against illicit piracy attacks, this work proposes a novel framework utilizing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) called ICtokens, uniquely linked to their corresponding physical ICs. Each ICtoken contains comprehensive information, including authentication data, supply chain stage and status, ownership details, and other IC metadata, while also making provision for the secure integration of a logic-locking key. Designed to be publicly logged, ICtokens securely obscure metering information without compromising functionality. In addition, the ICtracker, a distributed ledger technology powered by a swift and energy-efficient consortium blockchain, is used to register and manage ICtokens and their respective owners, tracking all associated interactions. This robust ledger guarantees the traceability and auditing of ICtokens while simultaneously developing a product-level NFT at every transaction point within the supply chain. Consequently, a scalable framework is established, creating unique, immutable digital twins for ICs and IC-embedded products in the form of ICtokens and their transactions. This provides a robust and reliable supply chain trail back to the original IP owner, while also offering unprecedented assurance to consumers of IC-embedded products. The rich information contained within ICtokens facilitates more detailed audits than previous proposals for IC supply chain monitoring. A proof-of-concept, implemented as an open-source solution, ensures the ease of adoption of the proposed framework.

该文研究了带有正交约束的分布式非凸优化问题。针对该问题，传统算法需要使用流形重traction或投影等方法来保证可行性，这些方法涉及到昂贵的线性代数运算（如SVD或矩阵求逆）。文章受到无重traction着陆算法的启发，提出了首个分布式无重traction梯度跟踪算法——DRFGT。理论上，证明了DRFGT具有$\mathcal{O}(1/K)$的ergodic收敛率，与中心化、基于重traction的方法收敛速度相匹配。此外，还在满足局部Riemannian P\L条件的情况下，进一步证明了DRFGT能够实现更快的线性收敛率。数值实验表明，DRFGT的表现与最先进的基于重traction的方法相当，但显著降低了计算开销。<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate decentralized non-convex optimization with orthogonal constraints. Conventional algorithms for this setting require either manifold retractions or other types of projection to ensure feasibility, both of which involve costly linear algebra operations (e.g., SVD or matrix inversion). On the other hand, infeasible methods are able to provide similar performance with higher computational efficiency. Inspired by this, we propose the first decentralized version of the retraction-free landing algorithm, called \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{R}etraction-\textbf{F}ree \textbf{G}radient \textbf{T}racking (DRFGT). We theoretically prove that DRFGT enjoys the ergodic convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$, matching the convergence rate of centralized, retraction-based methods. We further establish that under a local Riemannian P{\L} condition, DRFGT achieves a much faster linear convergence rate. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DRFGT performs on par with the state-of-the-art retraction-based methods with substantially reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Robots in densely populated real-world environments frequently encounter constrained and cluttered situations such as passing through narrow doorways, hallways, and corridor intersections, where conflicts over limited space result in collisions or deadlocks among the robots. Current decentralized state-of-the-art optimization- and neural network-based approaches (i) are predominantly designed for general open spaces, and (ii) are overly conservative, either guaranteeing safety, or liveness, but not both. While some solutions rely on centralized conflict resolution, their highly invasive trajectories make them impractical for real-world deployment. This paper introduces LiveNet, a fully decentralized and robust neural network controller that enables human-like yielding and passing, resulting in agile, non-conservative, deadlock-free, and safe, navigation in congested, conflict-prone spaces. LiveNet is minimally invasive, without requiring inter-agent communication or cooperative behavior. The key insight behind LiveNet is a unified CBF formulation for simultaneous safety and liveness, which we integrate within a neural network for robustness. We evaluated LiveNet in simulation and found that general multi-robot optimization- and learning-based navigation methods fail to even reach the goal, and while methods designed specially for such environments do succeed, they are 10-20 times slower, 4-5 times more invasive, and much less robust to variations in the scenario configuration such as changes in the start states and goal states, among others. We open-source the LiveNet code at https://github.com/srikarg89/LiveNet{https://github.com/srikarg89/LiveNet.

Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is emerging as a pivotal technology for enhancing traffic management and safety. Its rapid development demands solutions for enhanced communication efficiency and reduced latency. However, traditional centralized networks struggle to meet these demands, prompting the exploration of decentralized solutions such as blockchain. Addressing blockchain's scalability challenges posed by the growing number of nodes and transactions calls for innovative solutions, among which sharding stands out as a pivotal approach to significantly enhance blockchain throughput. However, existing schemes still face challenges related to a) the impact of vehicle mobility on blockchain consensus, especially for cross-shard transaction; and b) the strict requirements of low latency consensus in a highly dynamic network. In this paper, we propose a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) consensus leveraging Robust Dynamic Sharding and Tree-broadcasting (DRDST) to address these challenges. Specifically, we first develop a standard for evaluating the network stability of nodes, combined with the nodes' trust values, to propose a novel robust sharding model that is solved through the design of the Genetic Sharding Algorithm (GSA). Then, we optimize the broadcast latency of the whole sharded network by improving the tree-broadcasting to minimize the maximum broadcast latency within each shard. On this basis, we also design a DAG consensus scheme based on an improved hashgraph protocol, which can efficiently handle cross-shard transactions. Finally, the simulation proves the proposed scheme is superior to the comparison schemes in latency, throughput, consensus success rate, and node traffic load.

总结:
随着AI基础设施和可信执行环境（TEE）技术的发展，联邦学习作为服务（FLaaS）通过联合云计算（JCC）有望打破传统联邦学习中的异构边缘设备资源约束。然而，FLaaS面临着数据异质性导致的训练性能低下、不同云之间的高通信开销以及缺乏有效资源调度策略等问题。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种新的异步联邦学习方法——NebulaFL，用于多个云端的协同模型训练。针对数据异质性问题，NebulaFL在每个数据中心采用基于版本控制的异步FL训练方案来平衡数据所有者间的训练时间。为了降低通信开销，NebulaFL采用了去中心化的模型旋转机制实现知识的有效共享。同时，为了平衡训练时间和成本，NebulaFL整合了奖励引导的数据选择和资源调度策略。实验结果显示，与现有最先进的FL方法相比，NebulaFL能够在保持目标准确率的前提下，提高最多5.71%的准确性，减少高达50%的通信开销，并将成本降低了61.94%。 <div>

Abstract: With advancements in AI infrastructure and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology, Federated Learning as a Service (FLaaS) through JointCloud Computing (JCC) is promising to break through the resource constraints caused by heterogeneous edge devices in the traditional Federated Learning (FL) paradigm. Specifically, with the protection from TEE, data owners can achieve efficient model training with high-performance AI services in the cloud. By providing additional FL services, cloud service providers can achieve collaborative learning among data owners. However, FLaaS still faces three challenges, i.e., i) low training performance caused by heterogeneous data among data owners, ii) high communication overhead among different clouds (i.e., data centers), and iii) lack of efficient resource scheduling strategies to balance training time and cost. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel asynchronous FL approach named NebulaFL for collaborative model training among multiple clouds. To address data heterogeneity issues, NebulaFL adopts a version control-based asynchronous FL training scheme in each data center to balance training time among data owners. To reduce communication overhead, NebulaFL adopts a decentralized model rotation mechanism to achieve effective knowledge sharing among data centers. To balance training time and cost, NebulaFL integrates a reward-guided strategy for data owners selection and resource scheduling. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art FL methods, NebulaFL can achieve up to 5.71\% accuracy improvement. In addition, NebulaFL can reduce up to 50% communication overhead and 61.94% costs under a target accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents an experimental framework for implementing Decentralized Autonomous Database Systems (DADBS) using the Rust programming language. As traditional centralized databases face challenges in scalability, security, and autonomy, DADBS emerge as a promising solution, using blockchain principles to create distributed, self-governing database systems. Our framework explores the practical aspects of building a DADBS, focusing on Rust's unique features that improves system reliability and performance. We evaluated our DADBS implementation across several key performance metrics: throughput, latency(read), latency(write), scalability, CPU utilization, Memory Usage and Network I/O, The average results obtained over a 24-hour period of continuous operation were 3,000 transactions/second, 75 ms, 250 ms, 55%, 2.5 GB, 100MB/s. The security analysis depicts that even with an increase in the percentage of malicious nodes, DADBS still maintains high throughput and consistency. The paper discusses key design decisions, highlighting how Rust's ownership model and concurrency features address common challenges in distributed systems. We also examine the current limitations of our approach and potential areas for future research. By providing this comprehensive overview of a Rust-based DADBS implementation, we aim to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on decentralized database architectures and their practical realization.

该文深入调查了软件账单材料(SBOM)的完整性，这是确保软件供应链安全的重要工具，特别是在美国总统拜登签署的行政命令中强制要求联邦机构购买的软件必须提供SBOM。文章分析了SBOM在生成和消费阶段可能被利用的各种攻击向量，发现四种SBOM消费工具缺乏对依赖项的完整性的控制机制，同时七个主流编程语言的SBOM生成过程也容易受到完整性攻击，如通过操纵包管理器中的依赖版本号和额外文件导致SBOM数据不准确，进而可能导致在SBOM消费过程中忽视软件依赖关系和漏洞的存在。为解决这些问题，文中提出了一个采用去中心化存储软件库哈希值的解决方案。 <div>

Abstract: The SolarWinds attack that exploited weaknesses in the software update mechanism highlights the critical need for organizations to have better visibility into their software dependencies and potential vulnerabilities associated with them, and the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is paramount in ensuring software supply chain security. Under the Executive Order issued by President Biden, the adoption of the SBOM has become obligatory within the United States. The executive order mandates that an SBOM should be provided for all software purchased by federal agencies. The main applications of SBOMs are vulnerability management and license management. This work presents an in-depth and systematic investigation into the integrity of SBOMs. We explore different attack vectors that can be exploited to manipulate SBOM data, including flaws in the SBOM generation and consumption phases in the SBOM life cycle. We thoroughly investigated four SBOM consumption tools and the generation process of SBOMs for seven prominent programming languages. Our systematic investigation reveals that the tools used for consumption lack integrity control mechanisms for dependencies. Similarly, the generation process is susceptible to integrity attacks as well, by manipulating dependency version numbers in package managers and additional files, resulting in incorrect SBOM data. This could lead to incorrect views on software dependencies and vulnerabilities being overlooked during SBOM consumption. To mitigate these issues, we propose a solution incorporating the decentralized storage of hash values of software libraries.

本文探讨了在机器学习领域中，联邦学习（Federated Learning）带来的分布式模型训练和用户数据隐私保护的范式转变。文章提出了“隐私漂移”的新概念，将其与已知的现象——概念漂移相联系。隐私漂移描述的是随着模型增量训练，私人信息泄露程度的变化。研究通过定义并分析隐私漂移，揭示了模型性能演进与数据隐私完整性的微妙关系。实验深入探究了在FL系统中隐私漂移的动力学，重点关注模型更新和数据分布变化如何影响模型对隐私攻击（如成员推理攻击）的敏感性。结果表明，模型准确性的提高可能导致更大的隐私风险。研究者使用基于CIFAR-100定制的数据集进行了实验证明，展示了数据和概念漂移对隐私的影响。这项工作为未来关于隐私意识机器学习的研究奠定了基础，旨在寻求在去中心化环境中实现模型准确性与数据隐私之间的微妙平衡。 <div>

Abstract: In the evolving landscape of machine learning (ML), Federated Learning (FL) presents a paradigm shift towards decentralized model training while preserving user data privacy. This paper introduces the concept of ``privacy drift", an innovative framework that parallels the well-known phenomenon of concept drift. While concept drift addresses the variability in model accuracy over time due to changes in the data, privacy drift encapsulates the variation in the leakage of private information as models undergo incremental training. By defining and examining privacy drift, this study aims to unveil the nuanced relationship between the evolution of model performance and the integrity of data privacy. Through rigorous experimentation, we investigate the dynamics of privacy drift in FL systems, focusing on how model updates and data distribution shifts influence the susceptibility of models to privacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks (MIA). Our results highlight a complex interplay between model accuracy and privacy safeguards, revealing that enhancements in model performance can lead to increased privacy risks. We provide empirical evidence from experiments on customized datasets derived from CIFAR-100 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, 100 classes), showcasing the impact of data and concept drift on privacy. This work lays the groundwork for future research on privacy-aware machine learning, aiming to achieve a delicate balance between model accuracy and data privacy in decentralized environments.

Abstract: Ensuring security for highly dynamic peer-to-peer (P2P) networks has always been a challenge, especially for services like online transactions and smart devices. These networks experience high churn rates, making it difficult to maintain appropriate access control. Traditional systems, particularly Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), often fail to meet the needs of a P2P environment. This paper presents a blockchain-based access control framework that uses Ethereum smart contracts to address these challenges. Our framework aims to close the gaps in existing access control systems by providing flexible, transparent, and decentralized security solutions. The proposed framework includes access control contracts (ACC) that manage access based on static and dynamic policies, a Judge Contract (JC) to handle misbehavior, and a Register Contract (RC) to record and manage the interactions between ACCs and JC. The security model combines impact and severity-based threat assessments using the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and STRIDE principles, ensuring responses are tailored to different threat levels. This system not only stabilizes the fundamental issues of peer membership but also offers a scalable solution, particularly valuable in areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Web 3.0 technologies.

Abstract: Personalized medication aims to tailor healthcare to individual patient characteristics. However, the heterogeneity of patient data across healthcare systems presents significant challenges to achieving accurate and effective personalized treatments. Ethical concerns further complicate the aggregation of large volumes of data from diverse institutions. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising decentralized solution by enabling collaborative model training through the exchange of client models rather than raw data, thus preserving privacy. However, existing FL methods often suffer from retrogression during server aggregation, leading to a decline in model performance in real-world medical FL settings. To address data variability in distributed healthcare systems, we introduce Federated Meta-Learning for Personalized Medication (FedMetaMed), which combines federated learning and meta-learning to create models that adapt to diverse patient data across healthcare systems. The FedMetaMed framework aims to produce superior personalized models for individual clients by addressing these limitations. Specifically, we introduce Cumulative Fourier Aggregation (CFA) at the server to improve stability and effectiveness in global knowledge aggregation. CFA achieves this by gradually integrating client models from low to high frequencies. At the client level, we implement a Collaborative Transfer Optimization (CTO) strategy with a three-step process - Retrieve, Reciprocate, and Refine - to enhance the personalized local model through seamless global knowledge transfer. Experiments on real-world medical imaging datasets demonstrate that FedMetaMed outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods, showing superior generalization even on out-of-distribution cohorts.

Abstract: Some smart contracts violate decentralization principles by defining privileged accounts that manage other users' assets without permission, introducing centralization risks that have caused financial losses. Existing methods, however, face challenges in accurately detecting diverse centralization risks due to their dependence on predefined behavior patterns. In this paper, we propose JANUS, an automated analyzer for Solidity smart contracts that detects financial centralization risks independently of their specific behaviors. JANUS identifies differences between states reached by privileged and ordinary accounts, and analyzes whether these differences are finance-related. Focusing on the impact of risks rather than behaviors, JANUS achieves improved accuracy compared to existing tools and can uncover centralization risks with unknown patterns.
  To evaluate JANUS's performance, we compare it with other tools using a dataset of 540 contracts. Our evaluation demonstrates that JANUS outperforms representative tools in terms of detection accuracy for financial centralization risks . Additionally, we evaluate JANUS on a real-world dataset of 33,151 contracts, successfully identifying two types of risks that other tools fail to detect. We also prove that the state traversal method and variable summaries, which are used in JANUS to reduce the number of states to be compared, do not introduce false alarms or omissions in detection.

Abstract: WebAssembly (WASM) has emerged as a crucial technology in smart contract development for several blockchain platforms. Unfortunately, since their introduction, WASM smart contracts have been subject to several security incidents caused by contract vulnerabilities, resulting in substantial economic losses. However, existing tools for detecting WASM contract vulnerabilities have accuracy limitations, one of the main reasons being the coarse-grained emulation of the on-chain data APIs.
  In this paper, we introduce WACANA, an analyzer for WASM contracts that accurately detects vulnerabilities through fine-grained emulation of on-chain data APIs. WACANA precisely simulates both the structure of on-chain data tables and their corresponding API functions, and integrates concrete and symbolic execution within a coverage-guided loop to balance accuracy and efficiency. Evaluations on a vulnerability dataset of 133 contracts show WACANA outperforming state-of-the-art tools in accuracy. Further validation on 5,602 real-world contracts confirms WACANA's practical effectiveness.

Abstract: The agents in a Multi-Agent System (MAS) make observations about the system and send that information to a fusion center. The fusion center aggregates the information and concludes about the system parameters with as much accuracy as possible. However for the purposes of better efficiency of the system at large, the agents need to append some private parameters to the observed data. In this scenario, the data sent to the fusion center is faced with privacy risks. The data communicated to the fusion center must be secured against data privacy breaches and inference attacks in a decentralized manner. However, this in turn leads to a loss of utility of the data being sent to the fusion center. We quantify the utility and privacy of the system using Cosine similarity. We formulate our MAS problem in terms of deducing a concept for which compression-based methods are there in literature. Next, we propose a novel sanitization mechanism for our MAS using one such compression-based method while addressing the utility-privacy tradeoff problem.

Abstract: This study addresses the intricate challenge of decentralized output-feedback control for stochastic non-triangular nonlinear interconnected systems with unknown time-varying sensor sensitivity in a dynamic event-triggered context. The presence of stochastic disturbances, non-triangular structural uncertainties, and evolving sensor sensitivity distinguishes this problem of global asymptotic stability from conventional event-triggered control scenarios. Existing event-triggered control approaches with static event conditions encounter difficulties in simultaneously ensuring zero tracking/stabilization error and preventing the occurrence of Zeno behavior. In this work, we develop a novel solution to address this complex issue. Firstly, we establish a linear relationship between the state vector of each interconnected subsystem and two error vectors through a unique coordinate transformation. This transformation effectively handles the complexities introduced by non-triangular structural uncertainties. Secondly, we introduce a decentralized dynamic event-triggered output-feedback control strategy, which involves a state observer and a decentralized output-feedback controller. Unlike conventional event-triggered control methods with static event conditions, this strategy formulates a modified clock-based dynamic triggering mechanism by introducing an auxiliary variable that evolves based on predicted plant state values, while utilizing a clock variable to guarantee the existence of a positive lower bound on inter-execution times. Rigorous Lyapunov analysis confirms the global asymptotic stability in probability of the closed-loop system, with the states and the output of each local subsystem converging to the equilibrium at the origin in probability. Additionally, the existence of a minimal dwell-time between triggering instants is guaranteed.

Abstract: In the developing topic of smart cities, Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) are crucial for providing successful interaction between vehicles and infrastructure. This research proposes a distributed Blockchain-based Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (DistB-VNET) architecture that includes binary malicious traffic classification, Software Defined Networking (SDN), and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to ensure safe, scalable, and reliable vehicular networks in smart cities. The suggested framework is the decentralized blockchain for safe data management and SDN-NFV for dynamic network management and resource efficiency and a noble isolation forest algorithm works as an IDS (Intrusion Detection System). Further, "DistB-VNET" offers a dual-layer blockchain system, where a distributed blockchain provides safe communication between vehicles, while a centralized blockchain in the cloud is in charge of data verification and storage. This improves security, scalability, and adaptability, ensuring better traffic management, data security, and privacy in VANETs. Furthermore, the unsupervised isolation forest model achieves a high accuracy of 99.23% for detecting malicious traffic. Additionally, reveals that our method greatly improves network performance, offering decreased latency, increased security, and reduced congestion, an effective alternative for existing smart city infrastructures.

总结:

本文提出了一种名为vehicular Metaverse guard (VMGuard)的四层安全框架，用于保护车载元宇宙系统免受数据中毒攻击。该框架针对虚拟服务提供商(VSPs)通过恶意物联网(IoT)设备收集物理环境数据时可能存在的内容篡改问题，以及具有道德风险的恶意SIoT设备可能出于私利提供有毒数据以降低VMUs的服务质量和用户体验(QoS和QoE)的问题。VMGuard采用了基于用户反馈和主观逻辑建模的口碑激励机制，为参与的SIoT设备根据历史交互记录分配声誉评分。通过综合模拟验证，该机制能有效阻止恶意SIoT设备发起的中毒攻击，并确保先前被误分类的可靠SIoT设备不会被排除在未来市场轮次之外。 <div>

Abstract: The vehicular Metaverse represents an emerging paradigm that merges vehicular communications with virtual environments, integrating real-world data to enhance in-vehicle services. However, this integration faces critical security challenges, particularly in the data collection layer where malicious sensing IoT (SIoT) devices can compromise service quality through data poisoning attacks. The security aspects of the Metaverse services should be well addressed both when creating the digital twins of the physical systems and when delivering the virtual service to the vehicular Metaverse users (VMUs). This paper introduces vehicular Metaverse guard (VMGuard), a novel four-layer security framework that protects vehicular Metaverse systems from data poisoning attacks. Specifically, when the virtual service providers (VSPs) collect data about physical environment through SIoT devices in the field, the delivered content might be tampered. Malicious SIoT devices with moral hazard might have private incentives to provide poisoned data to the VSP to degrade the service quality (QoS) and user experience (QoE) of the VMUs. The proposed framework implements a reputation-based incentive mechanism that leverages user feedback and subjective logic modeling to assess the trustworthiness of participating SIoT devices. More precisely, the framework entails the use of reputation scores assigned to participating SIoT devices based on their historical engagements with the VSPs. Ultimately, we validate our proposed model using comprehensive simulations. Our key findings indicate that our mechanism effectively prevents the initiation of poisoning attacks by malicious SIoT devices. Additionally, our system ensures that reliable SIoT devices, previously missclassified, are not barred from participating in future rounds of the market.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that inherently allows edge devices to maintain their local training data, thus providing some level of privacy. However, FL's model updates still pose a risk of privacy leakage, which must be mitigated. Over-the-air FL (OTA-FL) is an adapted FL design for wireless edge networks that leverages the natural superposition property of the wireless medium. We propose a wireless physical layer (PHY) design for OTA-FL which improves differential privacy (DP) through a decentralized, dynamic power control that utilizes both inherent Gaussian noise in the wireless channel and a cooperative jammer (CJ) for additional artificial noise generation when higher privacy levels are required. Although primarily implemented within the Upcycled-FL framework, where a resource-efficient method with first-order approximations is used at every even iteration to decrease the required information from clients, our power control strategy is applicable to any FL framework, including FedAvg and FedProx as shown in the paper. This adaptation showcases the flexibility and effectiveness of our design across different learning algorithms while maintaining a strong emphasis on privacy. Our design removes the need for client-side artificial noise injection for DP, utilizing a cooperative jammer to enhance privacy without affecting transmission efficiency for higher privacy demands. Privacy analysis is provided using the Moments Accountant method. We perform a convergence analysis for non-convex objectives to tackle heterogeneous data distributions, highlighting the inherent trade-offs between privacy and accuracy. Numerical results show that our approach with various FL algorithms outperforms the state-of-the-art under the same DP conditions on the non-i.i.d. FEMNIST dataset, and highlight the cooperative jammer's effectiveness in ensuring strict privacy.

<br /><br />总结：
本文探讨了非同质化代币（NFT）慈善筹款活动中捐赠者的动机和经济后果，特别是捐赠者从升值的NFT中可能获得的财务收益对社会形象的影响。研究通过利用区块链上交易处理时间的随机变化来识别在慈善筹款活动中购买NFT对捐赠者后续市场结果的因果效应。进一步分析发现，将购得的慈善NFT重新上市出售（显示战略性慷慨行为）的个人以及在NFT市场中有较高社交曝光度的人，在其其他NFT的价格方面会受到显著惩罚。在线实验的结果也证实了这一发现，表明将慈善NFT转售以获利会让他人将其初始捐赠视为具有战略性的慷慨行为，从而降低他人从该捐赠者处购买NFT的意愿。这项研究强调了在加密慈善和更广泛的网络慈善领域中，数字可见性和可追溯性日益重要的影响。 <div>

Abstract: Crypto donations now represent a significant fraction of charitable giving worldwide. Nonfungible token (NFT) charity fundraisers, which involve the sale of NFTs of artistic works with the proceeds donated to philanthropic causes, have emerged as a novel development in this space. A unique aspect of NFT charity fundraisers is the significant potential for donors to reap financial gains from the rising value of purchased NFTs. Questions may arise about donors' motivations in these charity fundraisers, potentially resulting in a negative social image. NFT charity fundraisers thus offer a unique opportunity to understand the economic consequences of a donor's social image. We investigate these effects in the context of a large NFT charity fundraiser. We identify the causal effect of purchasing an NFT within the charity fundraiser on a donor's later market outcomes by leveraging random variation in transaction processing times on the blockchain. Further, we demonstrate a clear pattern of heterogeneity based on an individual's decision to relist (versus hold) the purchased charity NFTs (a sign of perceived strategic generosity) and based on an individual's social exposure within the NFT marketplace. We show that charity-NFT 're-listers' experience significant penalties in the market regarding the prices they can command for their other NFTs, particularly among those who are more socially exposed. Finally, we report the results of a scenario-based online experiment, which again support our findings, highlighting that the re-listing a charity NFT for sale at a profit leads others to perceive their initial donation as strategic generosity and reduces those others' willingness to purchase NFTs from the donor. Our study underscores the growing importance of digital visibility and traceability, features that characterize crypto-philanthropy, and online philanthropy more broadly.

Abstract: To mitigate the rising concern about privacy leakage, the federated recommender (FR) paradigm emerges, in which decentralized clients co-train the recommendation model without exposing their raw user-item rating data. The differentially private federated recommender (DPFR) further enhances FR by injecting differentially private (DP) noises into clients. Yet, current DPFRs, suffering from noise distortion, cannot achieve satisfactory accuracy. Various efforts have been dedicated to improving DPFRs by adaptively allocating the privacy budget over the learning process. However, due to the intricate relation between privacy budget allocation and model accuracy, existing works are still far from maximizing DPFR accuracy. To address this challenge, we develop BGTplanner (Budget Planner) to strategically allocate the privacy budget for each round of DPFR training, improving overall training performance. Specifically, we leverage the Gaussian process regression and historical information to predict the change in recommendation accuracy with a certain allocated privacy budget. Additionally, Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) is harnessed to make privacy budget allocation decisions by reconciling the current improvement and long-term privacy constraints. Our extensive experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that \emph{BGTplanner} achieves an average improvement of 6.76\% in training performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Mobile target tracking is crucial in various applications such as surveillance and autonomous navigation. This study presents a decentralized tracking framework utilizing a Consensus-Based Estimation Filter (CBEF) integrated with the Nearly-Constant-Velocity (NCV) model to predict a moving target's state. The framework facilitates agents in a network to collaboratively estimate the target's position by sharing local observations and achieving consensus despite communication constraints and measurement noise. A saturation-based filtering technique is employed to enhance robustness by mitigating the impact of noisy sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces the Mean Squared Estimation Error (MSEE) over time, indicating improved estimation accuracy and reliability. The findings underscore the effectiveness of the CBEF in decentralized environments, highlighting its scalability and resilience in the presence of uncertainties.

Abstract: In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.

Abstract: Developing secure smart contracts remains a challenging task. Existing approaches are either impractical or leave the burden to developers for fixing bugs. In this paper, we propose the first practical smart contract compiler, called HCC, which automatically inserts security hardening checks at the source-code level based on a novel and language-independent code property graph (CPG) notation. The high expressiveness of our developed CPG allows us to mitigate all of the most common smart contract vulnerabilities, namely reentrancy, integer bugs, suicidal smart contracts, improper use of tx.origin, untrusted delegate-calls, and unchecked low-level call bugs. Our large-scale evaluation on 10k real-world contracts and several sets of vulnerable contracts from related work demonstrates that HCC is highly practical, outperforms state-of-the-art contract hardening techniques, and effectively prevents all verified attack transactions without hampering functional correctness.

Abstract: The current Domain Name System (DNS), as a core infrastructure of the internet, exhibits several shortcomings: its centralized architecture leads to censorship risks and single points of failure, making domain name resolution vulnerable to attacks. The lack of encryption in the resolution process exposes it to DNS hijacking and cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, the high operational costs limit participation and innovation among small to medium-sized users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized Domain Name Service (DDNS) based on blockchain (Phicoin) and distributed storage (IPFS). By leveraging the immutability of blockchain and the content verification of IPFS, the system achieves decentralized storage and distribution of domain name records, eliminating the centralized dependencies of traditional DNS. With a block time of 15 seconds, the system supports rapid broadcasting of domain name updates, significantly improving resolution efficiency. The DDNS aims to serve as a complement or backup to the existing DNS system, providing a pollution-resistant, censorship-resistant, high-performance, and low-cost domain name resolution solution, offering a new technical path for the security and stability of the internet.

该文主要关注在数据分散于网络各节点并受到通信和隐私限制的情况下，如何进行贝叶斯学习的问题。标准的随机梯度Langevin动力学（SGLD）不适用于此场景，因此提出了分布式SGLD（DE-SGLD）算法。然而，现有的DE-SGLD算法在每个节点上存在偏差问题，即使使用完整批次的数据也是如此。为此，文章受EXTRA算法及其优化版本启发，提出了一种广义EXTRA随机梯度Langevin动力学算法，该算法成功消除了在全批次设置下的这一偏差。此外，在迷你批次设置下，新算法还提供了优于现有DE-SGLD算法的性能边界。数值实验进一步证实了所提方法的有效性。 <div>

Abstract: Langevin algorithms are popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian learning, particularly when the aim is to sample from the posterior distribution of a parametric model, given the input data and the prior distribution over the model parameters. Their stochastic versions such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) allow iterative learning based on randomly sampled mini-batches of large datasets and are scalable to large datasets. However, when data is decentralized across a network of agents subject to communication and privacy constraints, standard SGLD algorithms cannot be applied. Instead, we employ decentralized SGLD (DE-SGLD) algorithms, where Bayesian learning is performed collaboratively by a network of agents without sharing individual data. Nonetheless, existing DE-SGLD algorithms induce a bias at every agent that can negatively impact performance; this bias persists even when using full batches and is attributable to network effects. Motivated by the EXTRA algorithm and its generalizations for decentralized optimization, we propose the generalized EXTRA stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, which eliminates this bias in the full-batch setting. Moreover, we show that, in the mini-batch setting, our algorithm provides performance bounds that significantly improve upon those of standard DE-SGLD algorithms in the literature. Our numerical results also demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.

总结:
该论文介绍了arXiv:2412.01999v1中提出的一种新型技术，针对全球金融基础设施构建中能源消耗更低的、容错性强的复制数据库系统。现有的集群复制协议往往假设节点数量恒定且均匀分布，并仅考虑简单故障模型（如停止失败）。论文提出了适用于具有任意故障情况的异构可重构的地理复制协议AVA，允许副本动态加入和离开集群，并形式化证明了协议的安全性和活性。此外，AVA协议共识机制无关，即每个集群可以使用任何本地复制机制。实验结果显示，在谷歌云上进行的地理分布式部署实验表明，无需显著影响交易处理即可重新配置集群成员，而集群的异构性则可能显著提高吞吐量。 <div>

Abstract: Fault-tolerant replicated database systems consume less energy than the compute-intensive proof-of-work blockchain. Thus, they are promising technologies for the building blocks that assemble global financial infrastructure. To facilitate global scaling, clustered replication protocols are essential in orchestrating nodes into clusters based on proximity. However, the existing approaches often assume a homogeneous and fixed model in which the number of nodes across clusters is the same and fixed, and often limited to a fail-stop fault model. This paper presents heterogeneous and reconfigurable clustered replication for the general environment with arbitrary failures. In particular, we present AVA, a fault-tolerant reconfigurable geo-replication that allows dynamic membership: replicas are allowed to join and leave clusters. We formally state and prove the safety and liveness properties of the protocol. Furthermore, our replication protocol is consensus-agnostic, meaning each cluster can utilize any local replication mechanism. In our comprehensive evaluation, we instantiate our replication with both HotStuff and BFT-SMaRt. Experiments on geo-distributed deployments on Google Cloud demonstrates that members of clusters can be reconfigured without considerably affecting transaction processing, and that heterogeneity of clusters may significantly improve throughput.

Abstract: Blockchain smart contracts have catalyzed the development of decentralized applications across various domains, including decentralized finance. However, due to constraints in computational resources and the prevalence of data silos, current smart contracts face significant challenges in fully leveraging the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks such as intelligent analysis and reasoning. To address this gap, this paper proposes and implements a universal framework for integrating LLMs with blockchain data, {\sysname}, effectively overcoming the interoperability barriers between blockchain and LLMs. By combining semantic relatedness with truth discovery methods, we introduce an innovative data aggregation approach, {\funcname}, which significantly enhances the accuracy and trustworthiness of data generated by LLMs. To validate the framework's effectiveness, we construct a dataset consisting of three types of questions, capturing Q\&amp;A interactions between 10 oracle nodes and 5 LLM models. Experimental results demonstrate that, even with 40\% malicious nodes, the proposed solution improves data accuracy by an average of 17.74\% compared to the optimal baseline. This research not only provides an innovative solution for the intelligent enhancement of smart contracts but also highlights the potential for deep integration between LLMs and blockchain technology, paving the way for more intelligent and complex applications of smart contracts in the future.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a solution for distributed model training across decentralized, privacy-preserving devices, but the different energy capacities of participating devices (system heterogeneity) constrain real-world implementations. These energy limitations not only reduce model accuracy but also increase dropout rates, impacting on convergence in practical FL deployments. In this work, we propose LeanFed, an energy-aware FL framework designed to optimize client selection and training workloads on battery-constrained devices. LeanFed leverages adaptive data usage by dynamically adjusting the fraction of local data each device utilizes during training, thereby maximizing device participation across communication rounds while ensuring they do not run out of battery during the process. We rigorously evaluate LeanFed against traditional FedAvg on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, simulating various levels of data heterogeneity and device participation rates. Results show that LeanFed consistently enhances model accuracy and stability, particularly in settings with high data heterogeneity and limited battery life, by mitigating client dropout and extending device availability. This approach demonstrates the potential of energy-efficient, privacy-preserving FL in real-world, large-scale applications, setting a foundation for robust and sustainable pervasive AI on resource-constrained networks.

Abstract: We propose a new approach to visual perception for relative localization of agents within large-scale swarms of UAVs. Inspired by biological perception utilized by schools of sardines, swarms of bees, and other large groups of animals capable of moving in a decentralized yet coherent manner, our method does not rely on detecting individual neighbors by each agent and estimating their relative position, but rather we propose to regress a neighbor density over distance. This allows for a more accurate distance estimation as well as better scalability with respect to the number of neighbors. Additionally, a novel swarm control algorithm is proposed to make it compatible with the new relative localization method. We provide a thorough evaluation of the presented methods and demonstrate that the regressing approach to distance estimation is more robust to varying relative pose of the targets and that it is suitable to be used as the main source of relative localization for swarm stabilization.

Abstract: The advent of smart contracts has enabled the rapid rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on the Ethereum blockchain, offering substantial rewards in financial innovation and inclusivity. However, this growth has also introduced significant security risks, including the proliferation of illicit accounts involved in fraudulent activities. Traditional detection methods are limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the evolving tactics of malicious actors. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Learning Ensemble-based Illicit account Detection (SLEID) framework to address these challenges. SLEID employs an Isolation Forest for initial outlier detection and a self-training mechanism to iteratively generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled accounts, thereby enhancing detection accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLEID significantly outperforms traditional supervised approaches and recent semi-supervised models, achieving superior precision, recall, and F1-scores, particularly in detecting illicit accounts. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves better detection performance while reducing reliance on labeled data. The results affirm SLEID's efficacy as a robust solution for safeguarding the DeFi ecosystem and mitigating risks posed by malicious accounts.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges in many machine learning applications, particularly in the setting of distributed training and federated learning, where malicious agents seek to corrupt the training process with the goal of jeopardizing and compromising the performance and reliability of the final models. In this paper, we address the problem of robust federated learning in the presence of such attacks by formulating the training task as a bi-level optimization problem. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the resilience of consensus-based bi-level optimization (CB$^2$O), an interacting multi-particle metaheuristic optimization method, in adversarial settings. Specifically, we provide a global convergence analysis of CB$^2$O in mean-field law in the presence of malicious agents, demonstrating the robustness of CB$^2$O against a diverse range of attacks. Thereby, we offer insights into how specific hyperparameter choices enable to mitigate adversarial effects. On the practical side, we extend CB$^2$O to the clustered federated learning setting by proposing FedCB$^2$O, a novel interacting multi-particle system, and design a practical algorithm that addresses the demands of real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of the FedCB$^2$O algorithm against label-flipping attacks in decentralized clustered federated learning scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness in practical contexts.

本文提出了一种新的方案，旨在解决大规模低延迟混合网络（mixnet）与强可验证性和可靠性之间的挑战。现有的可验证性机制会引入显著的延迟开销，限制了mixnet的应用范围。该方案能够以几乎最优的时间复杂度，在去中心化的环境中估算mixnet中链接和节点的可靠性评分，且此过程独立于通过mixnet路由的总流量。它依赖于客户端凭证和基于VRF的路由新原语，确保合法客户端数据包遵循mixnet的路由策略，并随机生成不可伪造的测量数据包。实验结果在不可靠和对抗性环境下验证了该构造的可行性，证明了其可以实现在不影响客户端数据包传输延迟或产生显著带宽开销的情况下进行可靠性的估计。 <div>

Abstract: While there exist mixnets that can anonymously route large amounts of data packets with end to end latency that can be as low as a second, %making them attractive for a variety of applications, combining this level of performance with strong verifiability and reliability properties that ensure the correct processing and delivery of packets has proved challenging. Indeed, existing verifiability mechanisms are incompatible with scalable low-latency operation due to imposing significant latency overheads measuring in minutes to hours, hence severely limiting the variety of applications mixnets can serve. We address this important gap by proposing a scheme that can estimate reliability scores for a mixnet's links and nodes in a decentralized manner with essentially optimal complexity that is independent of the total traffic routed through the mixnet. The scores can be computed publicly by all participants from a set of measurement packets that are eventually revealed and act as a random sample of the traffic, without affecting mixnet transmission latency for client packets or incurring significant bandwidth overhead. Our scheme assumes client credentials and relies on VRF-based routing, a novel primitive that ensures that legitimate client packets follow the routing policy of the mixnet, as well as randomly generating unforgeable measurement packets. We experimentally validate our construction both in unreliable and adversarial settings, demonstrating its feasibility.

Abstract: Quantum security over long distances with untrusted relays is largely unfounded and is still an open question for active research. Nevertheless, quantum networks based on trusted relays are being built across the globe. However, standard QKD network architecture implores a complete trust requirement on QKD relays, which is too demanding and limits the use cases for QKD networks. In this work, we explore the possibility to securely relay a secret in a QKD network by relaxing the trust assumptions (if not completely) on the relay. We characterize QKD relays with different trust levels, namely, Full Access Trust (FAT), Partial Access Trust (PAT), and No Access Trust (NAT). As the name suggests, each level defines the degree with which a relay is required to be trusted with the secret provided by the key management system for end-to-end communication. We then review and propose multiple constructions of the QKD key management system based on the different trust levels. Main contribution of the paper is realized by evaluating key management systems with no access trust level. In principle, we review key management with centralized topology and propose a new decentralized key management system. These different topologies provide various advantages based on the QKD network requirements, allowing an operational flexibility in the architecture. We believe this work presents a new perspective to the open problem of providing a confiding and a practical solution for future long range secure communications

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical extension of the DeTEcT framework proposed by Sadykhov et al., DeTEcT, where a formal analysis framework was introduced for modelling wealth distribution in token economies. DeTEcT is a framework for analysing economic activity, simulating macroeconomic scenarios, and algorithmically setting policies in token economies. This paper proposes four ways of parametrizing the framework, where dynamic vs static parametrization is considered along with the probabilistic vs non-probabilistic. Using these parametrization techniques, we demonstrate that by adding restrictions to the framework it is possible to derive the existing wealth distribution models from DeTEcT. In addition to exploring parametrization techniques, this paper studies how money supply in DeTEcT framework can be transformed to become dynamic, and how this change will affect the dynamics of wealth distribution. The motivation for studying dynamic money supply is that it enables DeTEcT to be applied to modelling token economies without maximum supply (i.e., Ethereum), and it adds constraints to the framework in the form of symmetries.

Abstract: The once mythological 51% attack has moved beyond the hypothetical and now poses a legitimate widespread threat to blockchain technology. Current blockchains provide inferior throughput capacity when compared to that of centralized systems, creating an obvious vulnerability which allows the 51% attack to occur within decentralized systems. Despite recent advancements in blockchain which introduce interesting models that achieve high throughputs with enhanced security and privacy, no current networks have evolved to deploy the optimal solution of combining scalability, security, and distributed systems to create a legitimate supercomputing enterprise-grade developer sandbox. In this paper, we introduce an infinitely scalable, secure, and high throughput blockchain capable of amassing supercomputer speeds with off-the-shelf hardware, LuluChain. LuluChain simplifies the blockchain model to obtain greater functionality, speed, scalability, privacy, and flexibility, that works to combat the inflated pricing models set by the oligopolistic cloud computing market as it requires minimal computational work. By eliminating the need for timestamp synchronization and majority agreement among all participants, LuluChain opens the door to reliable trust, low-cost instant transactions, and flexible instant smart contracts. The supercomputing, high throughput distributed system is the ideal foundation for an essential distributed cloud marketplace.

Abstract: Incident response (IR) is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, requiring rapid decision-making and coordinated efforts to address cyberattacks effectively. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) as intelligent agents offers a novel approach to enhancing collaboration and efficiency in IR scenarios. This paper explores the application of LLM-based multi-agent collaboration using the Backdoors & Breaches framework, a tabletop game designed for cybersecurity training. We simulate real-world IR dynamics through various team structures, including centralized, decentralized, and hybrid configurations. By analyzing agent interactions and performance across these setups, we provide insights into optimizing multi-agent collaboration for incident response. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to enhance decision-making, improve adaptability, and streamline IR processes, paving the way for more effective and coordinated responses to cyber threats.

Abstract: Designing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenging due to the fact that the size of the joint state and action spaces are exponentially large in the number of agents. These difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm \texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ} (\textbf{Subsample}-\textbf{M}ean-\textbf{F}ield-\textbf{Q}-learning) and a decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For $k\leq n$, our algorithm system learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$. We show that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy in the order of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. We validate our method empirically on Gaussian squeeze and global exploration settings.

Abstract: As blockchain technology gains traction for enhancing data security and operational efficiency, traditional centralized authentication systems remain a significant bottleneck. This paper addresses the challenge of integrating decentralized authentication and access control within distributed networks. We propose a novel solution named ChainGuard, a fully decentralized authentication and access control mechanism based on smart contracts. ChainGuard eliminates the need for a central server by leveraging blockchain technology to manage user roles and permissions dynamically. Our scheme supports user interactions across multiple organizations simultaneously, enhancing security, efficiency, and transparency. By addressing key challenges such as scalability, security, and transparency, ChainGuard not only bridges the gap between traditional centralized systems and blockchain's decentralized ethos but also enhances data protection and operational efficiency.

Abstract: This work addresses the critical challenges of upgrading smart contracts, which are vital for trust in automated transactions but difficult to modify once deployed. To address this issue, we propose SEAM, a novel framework that automates the conversion of standard Solidity contracts into upgradable versions using the diamond pattern. SEAM simplifies the upgrade process and addresses two key vulnerabilities: function selector clashes and storage slot collisions. Additionally, the framework provides tools for efficiently deploying, modifying, and managing smart contract lifecycles. By enhancing contract security and reducing the learning curve for developers, SEAM lays a robust foundation for more flexible and maintainable blockchain applications.

Abstract: Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems face critical challenges, including excessive energy consumption and the centralization of mining power among entities with expensive hardware. Static mining pools exacerbate these issues by reducing competition and undermining the decentralized nature of blockchain networks, leading to economic inequality and inefficiencies in resource allocation. Their reliance on centralized pool managers further introduces vulnerabilities by creating a system that fails to ensure secure and fair reward distribution. This paper introduces a novel Collaborative Proof-of-Work (CPoW) mining approach designed to enhance efficiency and fairness in the Ethereum network. We propose a dynamic mining pool formation protocol that enables miners to collaborate based on their computational capabilities, ensuring fair and secure reward distribution by incorporating mechanisms to accurately verify and allocate rewards. By addressing the centralization and energy inefficiencies of traditional mining, this research contributes to a more sustainable blockchain ecosystem.

Abstract: An increasing number of distributed platforms combine Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with blockchains. Indeed, many hail the combination of TEEs and blockchains a good "marriage": TEEs bring confidential computing to the blockchain while the consensus layer could help defend TEEs from forking attacks.
  In this paper, we systemize how current blockchain solutions integrate TEEs and to what extent they are secure against forking attacks. To do so, we thoroughly analyze 29 proposals for TEE-based blockchains, ranging from academic proposals to production-ready platforms. We uncover a lack of consensus in the community on how to combine TEEs and blockchains. In particular, we identify four broad means to interconnect TEEs with consensus, analyze their limitations, and discuss possible remedies. Our analysis also reveals previously undocumented forking attacks on three production-ready TEE-based blockchains: Ten, Phala, and the Secret Network. We leverage our analysis to propose effective countermeasures against those vulnerabilities; we responsibly disclosed our findings to the developers of each affected platform.

Abstract: This paper proposes an energy-efficient federated learning method and its application in human activity monitoring and recognition. In the proposed approach, the device that needs a model for an application requests its nearby devices for collaboration. The nearby devices that accept the request, send their model updates to the requesting device. The device receives the model updates from the collaborators and performs aggregation to build its model. As mobile devices have limited battery life, the number of rounds is decided based on the desired accuracy level and battery level of the requesting device. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated with respect to prediction accuracy, training time, training energy consumption of the device, and response time. We have used two different datasets for performance evaluation. The first dataset contains different types of physical activities and the respective calorie burn. The second dataset is a human activity recognition dataset that considers six types of physical activities. The experimental results show that using the proposed method the training time and training energy consumption of the device are reduced by approximately 59% and 19% for the first and second datasets respectively, than the decentralized federated learning approach, while using LSTM as the underlying data analysis model. The results also present that the proposed method reduces the training time and energy consumption by approximately 55% and 72% for the first and second datasets respectively, than the decentralized federated learning approach while using MLP as the underlying data analysis model.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected the world in terms of health, economy and peace. Fortunately, the countries are trying to overcome the situation by actively carrying out vaccinations. However, like any other massive operation involving humans such as human resource management, elections, surveys, etc., the vaccination process raises several questions about citizen privacy and misuse of personal data. In most of the countries, few attempts have been made to verify the vaccination statistics as reported by the health centers. These issues collectively require the solutions of anonymity of citizens' personal information, immutability of vaccination data and easy yet restricted access by adversarial bodies such as the government for the verification and analysis of the data. This paper introduces a blockchain-based application to simulate and monitor the vaccination process. The structure of data model used in the proposed system is based on the IEEE Standard for Data Format for Blockchain Systems 2418.2TM-2020. The proposed system enables authorized stakeholders to share and access relevant information for vaccination process chain while preserving citizen privacy and accountability of the system. It is implemented on the Ethereum blockchain and uses a Python API for the simulation and validation of each step of the vaccination process.

Abstract: Partial observability of the underlying states generally presents significant challenges for reinforcement learning (RL). In practice, certain \emph{privileged information}, e.g., the access to states from simulators, has been exploited in training and has achieved prominent empirical successes. To better understand the benefits of privileged information, we revisit and examine several simple and practically used paradigms in this setting. Specifically, we first formalize the empirical paradigm of \emph{expert distillation} (also known as \emph{teacher-student} learning), demonstrating its pitfall in finding near-optimal policies. We then identify a condition of the partially observable environment, the \emph{deterministic filter condition}, under which expert distillation achieves sample and computational complexities that are \emph{both} polynomial. Furthermore, we investigate another useful empirical paradigm of \emph{asymmetric actor-critic}, and focus on the more challenging setting of observable partially observable Markov decision processes. We develop a belief-weighted asymmetric actor-critic algorithm with polynomial sample and quasi-polynomial computational complexities, in which one key component is a new provable oracle for learning belief states that preserve \emph{filter stability} under a misspecified model, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we also investigate the provable efficiency of partially observable multi-agent RL (MARL) with privileged information. We develop algorithms featuring \emph{centralized-training-with-decentralized-execution}, a popular framework in empirical MARL, with polynomial sample and (quasi-)polynomial computational complexities in both paradigms above. Compared with a few recent related theoretical studies, our focus is on understanding practically inspired algorithmic paradigms, without computationally intractable oracles.

Abstract: Software systems have been evolving rapidly and inevitably introducing bugs at an increasing rate, leading to significant losses in resources consumed by software maintenance. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in enhancing software development and maintenance practices, particularly in automated program repair (APR) with improved accuracy and efficiency of bug fixing. However, LLM-based APR heavily relies on high-quality code repositories. A larger portion of existing code repositories are for private use and proprietary assets from various industries, reflecting more diversity and nuances in the data since real-world industries often have more extensive software development practices, which cannot be covered by merely public datasets. Therefore, utilizing private datasets shows significant potential in enhancing software development and maintenance. However, obtaining such data from various industries is hindered by data privacy concerns, as companies are reluctant to share their codebases. To address the gap, we investigate the use of federated learning as a privacy-preserving approach that enables private entities to fine-tune LLMs on proprietary and decentralized data, facilitating the collaboration between clients to fully utilize their data to help enhance software development and maintenance. Our evaluation reveals that federated fine-tuning can effectively enhance program repair capabilities. Notably, the impact of heterogeneous code on LLM fine-tuning is negligible, indicating that real-world industries can benefit from collaborative development regardless of diverse data distributions. Furthermore, each type of federated algorithm exhibits unique strengths across different LLMs, suggesting that fine-tuning for program repair can be enhanced by tailoring the optimization process to specific characteristics of different LLMs.

Abstract: Euclidean Steiner trees are relevant to model minimal networks in real-world applications ubiquitously. In this paper, we study the feasibility of a hierarchical approach embedded with bundling operations to compute multiple and mutually disjoint Euclidean Steiner trees that avoid clutter and overlapping with obstacles in the plane, which is significant to model the decentralized and the multipoint coordination of agents in constrained 2D domains. Our computational experiments using arbitrary obstacle configuration with convex and non-convex geometries show the feasibility and the attractive performance when computing multiple obstacle-avoiding Steiner trees in the plane. Our results offer the mechanisms to elucidate new operators for obstacle-avoiding Steiner trees.

Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) has emerged as a state-of-the-art solution for item recommendation. However, existing GNN-based recommendation methods rely on a centralized storage of fragmented user-item interaction sub-graphs and training on an aggregated global graph, which will lead to privacy concerns. As a response, some recent works develop GNN-based federated recommendation methods by exploiting decentralized and fragmented user-item sub-graphs in order to preserve user privacy. However, due to privacy constraints, the graph convolution process in existing federated recommendation methods is incomplete compared with the centralized counterpart, causing a degradation of the recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel lossless and privacy-preserving graph convolution network (LP-GCN), which fully completes the graph convolution process with decentralized user-item interaction sub-graphs while ensuring privacy. It is worth mentioning that its performance is equivalent to that of the non-federated (i.e., centralized) counterpart. Moreover, we validate its effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical studies. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our LP-GCN outperforms the existing federated recommendation methods. The code will be publicly available once the paper is accepted.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce INTELLECT-1, the first 10 billion parameter language model collaboratively trained across the globe, demonstrating that large-scale model training is no longer confined to large corporations but can be achieved through a distributed, community-driven approach. INTELLECT-1 was trained on 1 trillion tokens using up to 14 concurrent nodes distributed across 3 continents, with contributions from 30 independent compute providers dynamically joining and leaving the training process, while maintaining 83-96% compute utilization and 36.2-41.4% model FLOPS utilization. We leverage PRIME, our scalable distributed training framework designed for fault-tolerant, high-performance training on unreliable, globally distributed nodes. Key innovations in PRIME include the ElasticDeviceMesh, which manages dynamic global process groups for fault-tolerant communication across the internet and local process groups for communication within a node, live checkpoint recovery kernels, and a hybrid DiLoCo-FSDP2 implementation. Using PRIME with DiLoCo and our custom int8 all-reduce, we achieve a 400x reduction in communication bandwidth compared to traditional data-parallel training settings while delivering comparable performance. These results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of training frontier foundation models in a decentralized network of global GPU resources.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving digital business landscape, organizations increasingly need to collaborate across boundaries to achieve complex business objectives, requiring both efficient process coordination and flexible decision-making capabilities. Traditional collaboration approaches face significant challenges in transparency, trust, and decision flexibility, while existing blockchain-based solutions primarily focus on process execution without addressing the integrated decision-making needs of collaborative enterprises. This paper proposes BlockCollab, a novel model-driven framework that seamlessly integrates Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) with Decision Model and Notation (DMN) to standardize and implement collaborative business processes and decisions on permissioned blockchain platforms. Our approach automatically translates integrated BPMN-DMN models into smart contracts(SCs) compatible with Hyperledger Fabric, enabling privacy-aware multi-organizational process execution through blockchain-based Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). The framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a standardized method for modeling collaborative processes and decisions using integrated BPMN-DMN model, (2) an automated SC generator that preserves both process logic and decision rules while maintaining privacy constraints, and (3) a hybrid on-chain/off-chain execution environment that optimizes collaborative workflows through secure data transfer and external system integration. Experimental evaluation across 11 real-world collaboration scenarios demonstrates that our approach achieves 100\% accuracy in process execution. Furthermore, an analysis of various execution processes highlights the strong practical applicability and reliability of our approach. The proposed framework includes an open-source third-party collaboration platform based on blockchain.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of database middleware for supporting distributed transaction processing is prevalent in numerous applications, with heterogeneous data sources deployed across national and international boundaries. However, transaction processing performance significantly drops due to the high network latency between the middleware and data sources and the long lock contention span, where transactions may be blocked while waiting for the locks held by concurrent transactions. In this paper, we propose GeoTP, a latency-aware geo-distributed transaction processing approach in database middlewares. GeoTP incorporates three key techniques to enhance geo-distributed transaction performance. First, we propose a decentralized prepare mechanism, which diminishes the requirement of network round trips for distributed transactions. Second, we design a latency-aware scheduler to minimize the lock contention span by strategically postponing the lock acquisition time point. Third, heuristic optimizations are proposed for the scheduler to reduce the lock contention span further. We implemented GeoTP on Apache Shardingsphere, a state-of-the-art middleware, and extended it into Apache ScalarDB. Experimental results on YCSB and TPC-C demonstrate that GeoTP achieves up to 17.7x performance improvement over Shardingsphere.

Abstract: Attestation of documents like legal papers, professional qualifications, medical records, and commercial documents is crucial in global transactions, ensuring their authenticity, integrity, and trustworthiness. Companies expanding operations internationally need to submit attested financial statements and incorporation documents to foreign governments or business partners to prove their businesses and operations' authenticity, legal validity, and regulatory compliance. Attestation also plays a critical role in education, overseas employment, and authentication of legal documents such as testaments and medical records. The traditional attestation process is plagued by several challenges, including time-consuming procedures, the circulation of counterfeit documents, and concerns over data privacy in the attested records. The COVID-19 pandemic brought into light another challenge: ensuring physical presence for attestation, which caused a significant delay in the attestation process. Traditional methods also lack real-time tracking capabilities for attesting entities and requesters. This paper aims to propose a new strategy using decentralized technologies such as blockchain and self-sovereign identity to overcome the identified hurdles and provide an efficient, secure, and user-friendly attestation ecosystem.

Abstract: Smart contracts are self-executing programs on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, which have revolutionized decentralized finance by enabling trustless transactions and the operation of decentralized applications. Despite their potential, the security of smart contracts remains a critical concern due to their immutability and transparency, which expose them to malicious actors. The connections of contracts further complicate vulnerability detection. This paper presents a systematic literature review that explores vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts, focusing on automated detection tools and benchmark evaluation. We reviewed 1,888 studies from five digital libraries and five major software engineering conferences, applying a structured selection process that resulted in 131 high-quality studies. The key results include a hierarchical taxonomy of 101 vulnerabilities grouped into ten categories, a comprehensive list of 144 detection tools with corresponding functionalities, methods, and code transformation techniques, and a collection of 102 benchmarks used for tool evaluation. We conclude with insights on the current state of Ethereum smart contract security and directions for future research.

Abstract: Biometric recognition as a unique, hard-to-forge, and efficient way of identification and verification has become an indispensable part of the current digital world. The fast evolution of this technology has been a strong incentive for integrating it into many applications. Meanwhile, blockchain, the very attractive decentralized ledger technology, has been widely received both by the research and industry in the past years and it is being increasingly deployed nowadays in many different applications, such as money transfer, IoT, healthcare, or logistics. Recently, researchers have started to speculate what would be the pros and cons and what would be the best applications when these two technologies cross paths. This paper provides a survey of technical literature research on the combination of blockchain and biometrics and includes a first legal analysis of this integration to shed light on challenges and potentials. While this combination is still in its infancy and a growing body of literature discusses specific blockchain applications and solutions in an advanced technological set-up, this paper presents a holistic understanding of blockchains applicability in the biometric sector. This study demonstrates that combining blockchain and biometrics would be beneficial for novel applications in biometrics such as the PKI mechanism, distributed trusted service, and identity management. However, blockchain networks at their current stage are not efficient and economical for real-time applications. From a legal point of view, the allocation of accountability remains a main issue, while other difficulties remain, such as conducting a proper Data Protection Impact Assessment. Finally, it supplies technical and legal recommendations to reap the benefits and mitigate the risks of the combination.

Abstract: Assessing the progression of muscle fatigue for daily exercises provides vital indicators for precise rehabilitation, personalized training dose, especially under the context of Metaverse. Assessing fatigue of multi-muscle coordination-involved daily exercises requires the neuromuscular features that represent the fatigue-induced characteristics of spatiotemporal adaptions of multiple muscles and the estimator that captures the time-evolving progression of fatigue. In this paper, we propose to depict fatigue by the features of muscle compensation and spinal module activation changes and estimate continuous fatigue by a physiological rationale model. First, we extract muscle synergy fractionation and the variance of spinal module spikings as features inspired by the prior of fatigue-induced neuromuscular adaptations. Second, we treat the features as observations and develop a Bayesian Gaussian process to capture the time-evolving progression. Third, we solve the issue of lacking supervision information by mathematically formulating the time-evolving characteristics of fatigue as the loss function. Finally, we adapt the metrics that follow the physiological principles of fatigue to quantitatively evaluate the performance. Our extensive experiments present a 0.99 similarity between days, a over 0.7 similarity with other views of fatigue and a nearly 1 weak monotonicity, which outperform other methods. This study would aim the objective assessment of muscle fatigue.

Abstract: As quantum processors advance, the emergence of large-scale decentralized systems involving interacting quantum-enabled agents is on the horizon. Recent research efforts have explored quantum versions of Nash and correlated equilibria as solution concepts of strategic quantum interactions, but these approaches did not directly connect to decentralized adaptive setups where agents possess limited information. This paper delves into the dynamics of quantum-enabled agents within decentralized systems that employ no-regret algorithms to update their behaviors over time. Specifically, we investigate two-player quantum zero-sum games and polymatrix quantum zero-sum games, showing that no-regret algorithms converge to separable quantum Nash equilibria in time-average. In the case of general multi-player quantum games, our work leads to a novel solution concept, that of the {separable} quantum coarse correlated equilibria (QCCE), as the convergent outcome of the time-averaged behavior no-regret algorithms, offering a natural solution concept for decentralized quantum systems. Finally, we show that computing QCCEs can be formulated as a semidefinite program and establish the existence of entangled (i.e., non-separable) QCCEs, which are unlearnable via the current paradigm of no-regret learning.

Abstract: We investigate multi-agent navigation tasks, where multiple agents need to reach initially unassigned goals in a limited time. Classical planning-based methods suffer from expensive computation overhead at each step and offer limited expressiveness for complex cooperation strategies. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a popular approach for addressing this issue. However, RL struggles with low data efficiency and cooperation when directly exploring (nearly) optimal policies in a large exploration space, especially with an increased number of agents(e.g., 10+ agents) or in complex environments (e.g., 3-D simulators). In this paper, we propose the Multi-Agent Scalable Graph-based Planner (MASP), a goal-conditioned hierarchical planner for navigation tasks with a substantial number of agents in the decentralized setting. MASP employs a hierarchical framework to reduce space complexity by decomposing a large exploration space into multiple goal-conditioned subspaces, where a high-level policy assigns agents goals, and a low-level policy navigates agents toward designated goals. For agent cooperation and the adaptation to varying team sizes, we model agents and goals as graphs to better capture their relationship. The high-level policy, the Goal Matcher, leverages a graph-based Self-Encoder and Cross-Encoder to optimize goal assignment by updating the agent and the goal graphs. The low-level policy, the Coordinated Action Executor, introduces the Group Information Fusion to facilitate group division and extract agent relationships across groups, enhancing training efficiency for agent cooperation. The results demonstrate that MASP outperforms RL and planning-based baselines in task efficiency.

Abstract: We investigate decentralized state estimation for a discrete event system in a setting where the information received at a coordinator may be corrupted or tampered by a malicious attacker. Specifically, a system is observed by a set of (local) observation sites (OSs) which occasionally send their recorded sequences of observations to the coordinator that is in charge of estimating the system state. The malfunctions and attacks, referred to as errors in this paper, include symbol deletions, insertions and replacements, each of which bears a positive cost. Two types of errors, global errors and local errors, are proposed to describe the impact of errors on decentralized information processing. Global errors occur when all OSs record the same error, while local errors occur when different OSs record different errors. Distinguishing these types of errors is important for a proper design of decentralized information processing (so as to be more resilient and better equipped to handle attacks and failures). For each type of error, we propose two methods to efficiently perform state estimation: one based on appropriately modifying the original system and the other based on inferring the matching behavior of the original system. For each method, we adopt an estimation-by-release methodology to design an algorithm for constructing a corresponding synchronizer for state estimation.

Abstract: The dramatic surge in the utilisation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) underscores the need for a secure and efficient mechanism to responsibly manage, use and disseminate multi-dimensional data generated by artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based copyright traceability framework called ring oscillator-singular value decomposition (RO-SVD), which introduces decomposition computing to approximate low-rank matrices generated from hardware entropy sources and establishes an AI-generated content (AIGC) copyright traceability mechanism at the device level. By leveraging the parallelism and reconfigurability of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), our framework can be easily constructed on existing AI-accelerated devices and provide a low-cost solution to emerging copyright issues of AIGC. We developed a hardware-software (HW/SW) co-design prototype based on comprehensive analysis and on-board experiments with multiple AI-applicable FPGAs. Using AI-generated images as a case study, our framework demonstrated effectiveness and emphasised customisation, unpredictability, efficiency, management and reconfigurability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical hardware study discussing and implementing copyright traceability specifically for AI-generated content.

Abstract: This paper develops a real-time decentralized metric-semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm framework that enables a heterogeneous robot team to collaboratively construct object-based metric-semantic maps of 3D environments featuring indoor, urban, and forests without relying on GPS. The framework integrates a data-driven front-end for instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are available. Our framework enables real-time decentralized operations onboard robots, allowing them to opportunistically leverage communication. We integrate the proposed framework with the autonomous navigation and exploration systems of three types of aerial and ground robots, conducting extensive experiments in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments. These experiments demonstrate accuracy in inter-robot localization and object mapping, along with its moderate demands on computation, storage, and communication resources. The framework is open-sourced and available as a modular stack for object-level metric-semantic SLAM, suitable for both single-agent and multi-robot scenarios.

Abstract: The scaled Web 3.0 digital economy, represented by decentralized finance (DeFi), has sparked increasing interest in the past few years, which usually relies on blockchain for token transfer and diverse transaction logic. However, illegal behaviors, such as financial fraud, hacker attacks, and money laundering, are rampant in the blockchain ecosystem and seriously threaten its integrity and security. In this paper, we propose a novel double graph-based Ethereum account de-anonymization inference method, dubbed DBG4ETH, which aims to capture the behavioral patterns of accounts comprehensively and has more robust analytical and judgment capabilities for current complex and continuously generated transaction behaviors. Specifically, we first construct a global static graph to build complex interactions between the various account nodes for all transaction data. Then, we also construct a local dynamic graph to learn about the gradual evolution of transactions over different periods. Different graphs focus on information from different perspectives, and features of global and local, static and dynamic transaction graphs are available through DBG4ETH. In addition, we propose an adaptive confidence calibration method to predict the results by feeding the calibrated weighted prediction values into the classifier. Experimental results show that DBG4ETH achieves state-of-the-art results in the account identification task, improving the F1-score by at least 3.75% and up to 40.52% compared to processing each graph type individually and outperforming similar account identity inference methods by 5.23% to 12.91%.

Abstract: This study addresses a critical gap in the literature regarding the use of Swarm Intelligence Optimization (SI) algorithms for client selection in Federated Learning (FL), with a focus on cybersecurity applications. Existing research primarily explores optimization techniques for centralized machine learning, leaving the unique challenges of client diveristy, non-IID data distributions, and adversarial noise in decentralized FL largely unexamined. To bridge this gap, we evaluate nine SI algorithms-Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Cuckoo Search, Bat Algorithm, Bee Colony, Ant Colony Optimization, Fish Swarm, Glow Worm, and Intelligent Water Droplet-across four experimental scenarios: fixed client participation, dynamic participation patterns, hetergeneous non-IID data distributions, and adversarial noise conditions. Results indicate that GWO exhibits superior adaptability and robustness, achieving the highest accuracy, recall and F1-scoress across all configurations, while PSO and Cuckoo Search also demonstrate strong performance. These findings underscore the potential of SI algorithms to address decentralized and adversarial FL challenges, offereing scalable and resilient solutions for cybersecurity applications, including intrusion detection in IoT and large-scale networks.

Abstract: In the era of big data, managing evolving graph data poses substantial challenges due to storage costs and privacy issues. Training graph neural networks (GNNs) on such evolving data usually causes catastrophic forgetting, impairing performance on earlier tasks. Despite existing continual graph learning (CGL) methods mitigating this to some extent, they predominantly operate in centralized architectures and overlook the potential of distributed graph databases to harness collective intelligence for enhanced performance optimization. To address these challenges, we present a pioneering study on Federated Continual Graph Learning (FCGL), which adapts GNNs to multiple evolving graphs within decentralized settings while adhering to storage and privacy constraints. Our work begins with a comprehensive empirical analysis of FCGL, assessing its data characteristics, feasibility, and effectiveness, and reveals two principal challenges: local graph forgetting (LGF), where local GNNs forget prior knowledge when adapting to new tasks, and global expertise conflict (GEC), where the global GNN exhibits sub-optimal performance in both adapting to new tasks and retaining old ones, arising from inconsistent client expertise during server-side parameter aggregation. To tackle these, we propose the POWER framework, which mitigates LGF by preserving and replaying experience nodes with maximum local-global coverage at each client and addresses GEC by using a pseudo prototype reconstruction strategy and trajectory-aware knowledge transfer at the central server. Extensive evaluations across multiple graph datasets demonstrate POWER's superior performance over straightforward federated extensions of the centralized CGL algorithms and vision-focused federated continual learning algorithms.

总结:<br />
本文首次对去中心化交易所(DEX)中的状态脱轨缺陷进行了系统性研究，定义了五类状态脱轨缺陷并进行详细分析。为了解决这一问题，文中提出了一种名为StateGuard的新型深度学习框架，用于检测DEX智能合约中的状态脱轨缺陷。该框架利用智能合约拆解器将合约转化为抽象语法树(AST)，从中提取出五类依赖特征；接着，通过图优化器处理结构化数据；最后，使用图卷积网络(GCNs)对优化后的数据进行分析，以识别潜在的状态脱轨缺陷。在包含46个DEX项目和5,671个智能合约的数据集上评估后，StateGuard达到了94.25%的F1得分，并在与现有最优方法的对比实验中提升了6.29%的F1得分。为了验证其实用性，StateGuard还被应用于审计真实世界的合同并成功发现了多个新的CVE漏洞。 <div>

Abstract: The decentralized exchange (DEX) leverages smart contracts to trade digital assets for users on the blockchain. Developers usually develop several smart contracts into one project, implementing complex logic functions and multiple transaction operations. However, the interaction among these contracts poses challenges for developers analyzing the state logic. Due to the complex state logic in DEX projects, many critical state derailment defects have emerged in recent years. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study of state derailment defects in DEX. We define five categories of state derailment defects and provide detailed analyses of them. Furthermore, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework StateGuard for detecting state derailment defects in DEX smart contracts. It leverages a smart contract deconstructor to deconstruct the contract into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), from which five categories of dependency features are extracted. Next, it implements a graph optimizer to process the structured data. At last, the optimized data is analyzed by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to identify potential state derailment defects. We evaluated StateGuard through a dataset of 46 DEX projects containing 5,671 smart contracts, and it achieved 94.25% F1-score. In addition, in a comparison experiment with state-of-the-art, StateGuard leads the F1-score by 6.29%. To further verify its practicality, we used StateGuar to audit real-world contracts and successfully authenticated multiple novel CVEs.

Abstract: Blockchains have sparked global interest in recent years, gaining importance as they increasingly influence technology and finance. This thesis investigates the robustness of blockchain protocols, specifically focusing on Ethereum Proof-of-Stake. We define robustness in terms of two critical properties: Safety, which ensures that the blockchain will not have permanent conflicting blocks, and Liveness, which guarantees the continuous addition of new reliable blocks.
  Our research addresses the gap between traditional distributed systems approaches, which classify agents as either honest or Byzantine (i.e., malicious or faulty), and game-theoretic models that consider rational agents driven by incentives. We explore how incentives impact the robustness with both approaches.
  The thesis comprises three distinct analyses. First, we formalize the Ethereum PoS protocol, defining its properties and examining potential vulnerabilities through a distributed systems perspective. We identify that certain attacks can undermine the system's robustness. Second, we analyze the inactivity leak mechanism, a critical feature of Ethereum PoS, highlighting its role in maintaining system liveness during network disruptions but at the cost of safety. Finally, we employ game-theoretic models to study the strategies of rational validators within Ethereum PoS, identifying conditions under which these agents might deviate from the prescribed protocol to maximize their rewards.
  Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the importance of incentive mechanisms for blockchain robustness and provide insights into designing more resilient blockchain protocols.

Abstract: Smart contracts are essential for managing digital assets in blockchain networks, highlighting the need for effective security measures. This paper introduces SmartLLMSentry, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT with in-context training, to advance smart contract vulnerability detection. Traditional rule-based frameworks have limitations in integrating new detection rules efficiently. In contrast, SmartLLMSentry utilizes LLMs to streamline this process. We created a specialized dataset of five randomly selected vulnerabilities for model training and evaluation. Our results show an exact match accuracy of 91.1% with sufficient data, although GPT-4 demonstrated reduced performance compared to GPT-3 in rule generation. This study illustrates that SmartLLMSentry significantly enhances the speed and accuracy of vulnerability detection through LLMdriven rule integration, offering a new approach to improving Blockchain security and addressing previously underexplored vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

总结:
<br />
本文探讨了联邦学习中参数高效微调（FedPEFT）的新安全威胁。FedPEFT是一种用于保护隐私和提高预训练语言模型在分布式环境下的适应效率的方法。然而，文章提出了一种名为PEFT-as-an-Attack (PaaA) 的新攻击手段，该攻击利用PEFT方法如LoRA，即使在少量参数可训练及仅少数客户端恶意操作的情况下，也能绕过PLM的安全对齐，生成有害内容。实验显示，此攻击的成功率约为80%。为应对这一威胁，文章研究了包括鲁棒聚合方案（RASs）和后PEFT安全对齐（PPSA）在内的防御策略，但发现现有防御措施在处理高度异构数据分布情况时存在局限性，如DnC和ClippedClustering等先进RASs防御效果不佳；而PPSA虽能降低攻击成功率至10%以下，却会显著损害模型在目标任务上的准确性。因此，文章强调了急需开发更有效的防御机制以同时确保安全性并保持FedPEFT范式的性能。 <div>

Abstract: Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving and efficient adaptation of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) in Federated Learning (FL) settings. It preserves data privacy by keeping the data decentralized and training the model on local devices, ensuring that raw data never leaves the user's device. Moreover, the integration of PEFT methods such as LoRA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to fine-tuning the entire model, thereby minimizing communication costs and computational overhead. Despite its potential, the security implications of FedPEFT remain underexplored. This paper introduces a novel security threat to FedPEFT, termed PEFT-as-an-Attack (PaaA), which exposes how PEFT can be exploited as an attack vector to circumvent PLMs' safety alignment and generate harmful content in response to malicious prompts. Our evaluation of PaaA reveals that with less than 1% of the model's parameters set as trainable, and a small subset of clients acting maliciously, the attack achieves an approximate 80% attack success rate using representative PEFT methods such as LoRA. To mitigate this threat, we further investigate potential defense strategies, including Robust Aggregation Schemes (RASs) and Post-PEFT Safety Alignment (PPSA). However, our empirical analysis highlights the limitations of these defenses, i.e., even the most advanced RASs, such as DnC and ClippedClustering, struggle to defend against PaaA in scenarios with highly heterogeneous data distributions. Similarly, while PPSA can reduce attack success rates to below 10%, it severely degrades the model's accuracy on the target task. Our results underscore the urgent need for more effective defense mechanisms that simultaneously ensure security and maintain the performance of the FedPEFT paradigm.

<br /><br />总结：
本文将Transit Signal Priority (TSP)整合到基于多智能体强化学习(MARL)的交通信号控制中。首先，研究开发了一种针对两个协同工作的交叉路口的自适应信号控制系统，使用MARL和价值分解网络(VDN)架构进行集中训练，结果显示其性能略优于基于v/c为0.95的整体交叉口延迟的协调感应信号控制。接着，将训练好的信号控制智能体作为背景控制器，研究了两种事件驱动的TSP智能体方案：一种是在分散式训练和分散式执行(DTDE)框架下训练独立的TSP智能体；另一种则采用集中式训练和分散式执行(CTDE)框架以及VDN架构训练协调的TSP智能体以选择并实施跨两个交叉路口的协调TSP策略。经过训练，两种TSP方案都能有效减少公交车延误，其中独立TSP智能体相较于无TSP情况可降低两个交叉口的公交车延误达22%，而协调TSP智能体能实现27%的延误减少。在此过程中，对于多数次级街道行驶方向，仅有轻微的延迟增加。 <div>

Abstract: This study integrates Transit Signal Priority (TSP) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based traffic signal control. The first part of the study develops adaptive signal control based on MARL for a pair of coordinated intersections in a microscopic simulation environment. The two agents, one for each intersection, are centrally trained using a value decomposition network (VDN) architecture. The trained agents show slightly better performance compared to coordinated actuated signal control based on overall intersection delay at v/c of 0.95. In the second part of the study the trained signal control agents are used as background signal controllers while developing event-based TSP agents. In one variation, independent TSP agents are formulated and trained under a decentralized training and decentralized execution (DTDE) framework to implement TSP at each intersection. In the second variation, the two TSP agents are centrally trained under a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework and VDN architecture to select and implement coordinated TSP strategies across the two intersections. In both cases the agents converge to the same bus delay value, but independent agents show high instability throughout the training process. For the test runs, the two independent agents reduce bus delay across the two intersections by 22% compared to the no TSP case while the coordinated TSP agents achieve 27% delay reduction. In both cases, there is only a slight increase in delay for a majority of the side street movements.

总结:<br />
本文研究了如何针对动态环境优化机器人集群的任务分配问题，提出了一种利用分布式部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程(Dec-POMDP)的新框架。该框架设计了一个名为局部信息聚合多智能体深度确定性策略梯度（LIA_MADDPG）的算法，实现了集中式训练和分布式执行相结合。其中，LIA模块在训练阶段负责从邻近机器人收集关键数据以提升决策效率；在执行阶段，则提出了根据变化和部分可观测的环境条件动态调整任务分配的策略改进方法。实验结果显示，LIA模块可以无缝融入基于CTDE的多种MARL方法，显著提升了性能。相比于六种传统强化学习算法和一个启发式算法，LIA_MADDPG展现出了更优的可扩展性、对环境变化的快速适应能力以及维持稳定性和收敛速度的能力，证实了其在动态环境下通过增强局部协作和自适应策略执行来有效改善机器人集群任务分配的潜力。 <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore how to optimize task allocation for robot swarms in dynamic environments, emphasizing the necessity of formulating robust, flexible, and scalable strategies for robot cooperation. We introduce a novel framework using a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec_POMDP), specifically designed for distributed robot swarm networks. At the core of our methodology is the Local Information Aggregation Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (LIA_MADDPG) algorithm, which merges centralized training with distributed execution (CTDE). During the centralized training phase, a local information aggregation (LIA) module is meticulously designed to gather critical data from neighboring robots, enhancing decision-making efficiency. In the distributed execution phase, a strategy improvement method is proposed to dynamically adjust task allocation based on changing and partially observable environmental conditions. Our empirical evaluations show that the LIA module can be seamlessly integrated into various CTDE-based MARL methods, significantly enhancing their performance. Additionally, by comparing LIA_MADDPG with six conventional reinforcement learning algorithms and a heuristic algorithm, we demonstrate its superior scalability, rapid adaptation to environmental changes, and ability to maintain both stability and convergence speed. These results underscore LIA_MADDPG's outstanding performance and its potential to significantly improve dynamic task allocation in robot swarms through enhanced local collaboration and adaptive strategy execution.

总结:

本文针对存在非周期性和异步采样测量值情况下，连续线性时不变（LTI）系统的状态估计问题进行了研究。文章考虑了传感器通过未受保护的通信通道向融合中心传输测量值及时间戳的过程中，系统可能遭受包括篡改测量值、篡改时间戳以及混合恶意活动等攻击。为应对这类更强大的攻击，文中提出了一种分散式局部估计算法，每个传感器根据其自身的测量数据以异步方式维护本地状态估计。通过时间预测和事件触发的方式实现局部状态同步与融合。当采样时间无病态情况时，证明在没有攻击的情况下，本地估计可恢复到最优卡尔曼估计。在存在攻击的情况下，文章提出了采用$\ell_1$范数正则化的最小二乘问题生成安全估计，并确保在满足可观测性冗余条件下误差保持有界。最后，通过对IEEE 14-bus系统的基准案例分析展示了所提算法的有效性。<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2411.19765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the state estimation problem in continuous LTI systems under attacks with non-periodic and asynchronous sampled measurements. The non-periodic and asynchronous sampling requires sensors to transmit not only the measurement values but also the sampling time-stamps to the fusion center via unprotected communication channels. This communication scheme leaves the system vulnerable to a variety of malicious activities such as (i) manipulating measurement values, (ii) manipulating time-stamps, (iii) hybrid manipulations such as generating fake measurements or eliminating the measurement. To deal with such more powerful attacks, we propose a decentralized local estimation algorithm where each sensor maintains its local state estimate based on its measurements in an asynchronous fashion. The local states are synchronized by time-prediction and fused in an event-triggered manner. In the absence of attacks, local estimates are proved to recover the optimal Kalman estimation by our carefully designed weighted least square problem, given that the sample time is non-pathological. In the presence of attacks, an $\ell_1$ regularized least square problem is proposed to generate secure estimates with uniformly bounded error as long as the observability redundancy is satisfied. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through a benchmark example of the IEEE 14-bus system.

Abstract: Rapid detection of foodborne bacteria is critical for food safety and quality, yet traditional culture-based methods require extended incubation and specialized sample preparation. This study addresses these challenges by i) enhancing the generalizability of AI-enabled microscopy for bacterial classification using adversarial domain adaptation and ii) comparing the performance of single-target and multi-domain adaptation. Three Gram-positive (Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria innocua) and three Gram-negative (E. coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium) strains were classified. EfficientNetV2 served as the backbone architecture, leveraging fine-grained feature extraction for small targets. Few-shot learning enabled scalability, with domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) addressing single domains and multi-DANNs (MDANNs) generalizing across all target domains. The model was trained on source domain data collected under controlled conditions (phase contrast microscopy, 60x magnification, 3-h bacterial incubation) and evaluated on target domains with variations in microscopy modality (brightfield, BF), magnification (20x), and extended incubation to compensate for lower resolution (20x-5h). DANNs improved target domain classification accuracy by up to 54.45% (20x), 43.44% (20x-5h), and 31.67% (BF), with minimal source domain degradation (<4.44%). MDANNs achieved superior performance in the BF domain and substantial gains in the 20x domain. Grad-CAM and t-SNE visualizations validated the model's ability to learn domain-invariant features across diverse conditions. This study presents a scalable and adaptable framework for bacterial classification, reducing reliance on extensive sample preparation and enabling application in decentralized and resource-limited environments.

Abstract: The evolving landscape of edge computing envisions platforms operating as dynamic intermediaries between application providers and edge servers (ESs), where task offloading is coupled with payments for computational services. Ensuring efficient resource utilization and meeting stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements necessitates incentivizing ESs while optimizing the platforms operational objectives. This paper investigates a multi-agent system where both the platform and ESs are self-interested entities, addressing the joint optimization of revenue maximization, resource allocation, and task offloading. We propose a novel Stackelberg game-based framework to model interactions between stakeholders and solve the optimization problem using a Bayesian Optimization-based centralized algorithm. Recognizing practical challenges in information collection due to privacy concerns, we further design a decentralized solution leveraging neural network optimization and a privacy-preserving information exchange protocol. Extensive numerical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms in achieving superior performance compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Modern database systems are expected to handle dynamic data whose characteristics may evolve over time. Many popular database benchmarks are limited in their ability to evaluate this dynamic aspect of the database systems. Those that use synthetic data generators often fail to capture the complexity and unpredictable nature of real data, while most real-world datasets are static and difficult to create high-volume, realistic updates for. This paper introduces CrypQ, a database benchmark leveraging dynamic, public Ethereum blockchain data. CrypQ offers a high-volume, ever-evolving dataset reflecting the unpredictable nature of a real and active cryptocurrency market. We detail CrypQ's schema, procedures for creating data snapshots and update sequences, and a suite of relevant SQL queries. As an example, we demonstrate CrypQ's utility in evaluating cost-based query optimizers on complex, evolving data distributions with real-world skewness and dependencies.

Abstract: Detecting energy theft is vital for effectively managing power grids, as it ensures precise billing and prevents financial losses. Split-learning emerges as a promising decentralized machine learning technique for identifying energy theft while preserving user data confidentiality. Nevertheless, traditional split learning approaches are vulnerable to privacy leakage attacks, which significantly threaten data confidentiality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel GAN-Transformer-based split learning framework in this paper. This framework leverages the strengths of the transformer architecture, which is known for its capability to process long-range dependencies in energy consumption data. Thus, it enhances the accuracy of energy theft detection without compromising user privacy. A distinctive feature of our approach is the deployment of a novel mask-based method, marking a first in its field to effectively combat privacy leakage in split learning scenarios targeted at AI-enabled adversaries. This method protects sensitive information during the model's training phase. Our experimental evaluations indicate that the proposed framework not only achieves accuracy levels comparable to conventional methods but also significantly enhances privacy protection. The results underscore the potential of the GAN-Transformer split learning framework as an effective and secure tool in the domain of energy theft detection.

<br /><br />总结:

本文提出了一个针对联邦学习(Federated Learning)的新式数据重建攻击方法。该攻击利用恶意代码注射技术，结合独特的稀疏编码设计和区块划分策略，能够在不引起模型明显变化的情况下，隐秘地嵌入隐藏模型并系统性地抽取敏感数据。通过基于斐波那契指数的设计实现高效结构化的数据检索，而区块划分则增强了处理大规模及高分辨率图像的能力。实验结果显示，与五种最先进的数据重建攻击方法相比，本文的方法在五个不同的检测方法下表现更优，且能够逃避现有的数据重建防御手段，同时适用于FedAVG和FedSGD两种联邦学习场景。文章强调了开发者需要针对此类新威胁开发新的防御措施，并承诺将在论文被接受后开源相关代码。 <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a paradigm for conducting machine learning across broad and decentralized datasets, promising enhanced privacy by obviating the need for direct data sharing. However, recent studies show that attackers can steal private data through model manipulation or gradient analysis. Existing attacks are constrained by low theft quantity or low-resolution data, and they are often detected through anomaly monitoring in gradients or weights. In this paper, we propose a novel data-reconstruction attack leveraging malicious code injection, supported by two key techniques, i.e., distinctive and sparse encoding design and block partitioning. Unlike conventional methods that require detectable changes to the model, our method stealthily embeds a hidden model using parameter sharing to systematically extract sensitive data. The Fibonacci-based index design ensures efficient, structured retrieval of memorized data, while the block partitioning method enhances our method's capability to handle high-resolution images by dividing them into smaller, manageable units. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets confirmed that our method is superior to the five state-of-the-art data-reconstruction attacks under the five respective detection methods. Our method can handle large-scale and high-resolution data without being detected or mitigated by state-of-the-art data reconstruction defense methods. In contrast to baselines, our method can be directly applied to both FedAVG and FedSGD scenarios, underscoring the need for developers to devise new defenses against such vulnerabilities. We will open-source our code upon acceptance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising method to collaboratively learn from decentralized and heterogeneous data available at different clients without the requirement of data ever leaving the clients. Recent works on FL have advocated taking a Bayesian approach to FL as it offers a principled way to account for the model and predictive uncertainty by learning a posterior distribution for the client and/or server models. Moreover, Bayesian FL also naturally enables personalization in FL to handle data heterogeneity across the different clients by having each client learn its own distinct personalized model. In particular, the hierarchical Bayesian approach enables all the clients to learn their personalized models while also taking into account the commonalities via a prior distribution provided by the server. However, despite their promise, Bayesian approaches for FL can be computationally expensive and can have high communication costs as well because of the requirement of computing and sending the posterior distributions. We present a novel Bayesian FL method using an efficient second-order optimization approach, with a computational cost that is similar to first-order optimization methods like Adam, but also provides the various benefits of the Bayesian approach for FL (e.g., uncertainty, personalization), while also being significantly more efficient and accurate than SOTA Bayesian FL methods (both for standard as well as personalized FL settings). Our method achieves improved predictive accuracies as well as better uncertainty estimates as compared to the baselines which include both optimization based as well as Bayesian FL methods.

Abstract: Client diversity in the Ethereum blockchain refers to the use of multiple independent implementations of the Ethereum protocol. This effectively enhances network resilience by reducing reliance on any single software client implementation. With client diversity, a single bug cannot tear the whole network down. However, despite multiple production-grade client implementations being available, there is still a heavily skewed distribution of clients in Ethereum. This is a concern for the community. In this paper, we introduce a novel conceptual framework for client diversity. The core goal is to improve the network resilience as a systemic property. Our key insight is to leverage economic incentives and verifiable execution to encourage the adoption of minority clients, thereby fostering a more robust blockchain ecosystem. Concretely, we propose to unambiguously and provably identify the client implementation used by any protocol participant, and to use this information to incentivize the usage of minority clients by offering higher participation rewards. We outline a detailed blueprint for our conceptual framework, in the realm of Ethereum. Our proposal is a game changer for improving client diversity of blockchains. Ultimately, it applies to strengthening the resilience of any decentralized distributed systems.

Abstract: Integrating the gas and district heating with the electrical grid in a multi-energy grid has been shown to provide flexibility and prevent bottlenecks in the operation of electrical distribution grids. This integration assumes a top-down grid planning approach and a perfect knowledge of consumer behaviour. In reality, consumers decides whether to adopt a heating technology based on costs and government regulation. This behavior is highly uncertain and depends on fluctuations in heating technology costs and energy prices. The uncertainty associated with consumer behavior increases the risk of investment in grid expansion. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes an approach with the consumer at the center of the planning method. Robust optimization is used to model the uncertainty in prices to reduce the risk of investment in grid expansion. The uncertainty in energy prices is modeled using interval uncertainty with a proportional deviation. This allows planners, operators and regulators to predict the adoption rate of certain heating technology in different geographical areas and prioritize the expansion of specific grids where they are required. By minimizing a cost function subject to robust constraints, the strategy ensures robustness against uncertainties in energy prices. This robust optimization approach is applied to Hamburg as a case study. The result of the optimization represents the consumer's decision. The impact of the consumer's decision on the electrical grid is analzed on different benchmark distribution grids. The study concludes that district heating expansion in high-density areas is a low-risk investment for carbon neutrality. In less dense areas, electrification supports decentralized heat pumps. Meanwhile, hydrogen gas grids are viable where electric expansion is impractical. Increased uncertainty leads to more conservative solutions.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning approach that has gained attention for its potential to enable collaborative model training across clients while protecting data privacy, making it an attractive solution for the chemical industry. This work aims to provide the chemical engineering community with an accessible introduction to the discipline. Supported by a hands-on tutorial and a comprehensive collection of examples, it explores the application of FL in tasks such as manufacturing optimization, multimodal data integration, and drug discovery while addressing the unique challenges of protecting proprietary information and managing distributed datasets. The tutorial was built using key frameworks such as $\texttt{Flower}$ and $\texttt{TensorFlow Federated}$ and was designed to provide chemical engineers with the right tools to adopt FL in their specific needs. We compare the performance of FL against centralized learning across three different datasets relevant to chemical engineering applications, demonstrating that FL will often maintain or improve classification performance, particularly for complex and heterogeneous data. We conclude with an outlook on the open challenges in federated learning to be tackled and current approaches designed to remediate and improve this framework.

Abstract: In the domain of large language models, considerable advancements have been attained in multimodal large language models and explainability research, propelled by the continuous technological progress and innovation. Nonetheless, security and privacy concerns continue to pose as prominent challenges in this field. The emergence of blockchain technology, marked by its decentralized nature, tamper-proof attributes, distributed storage functionality, and traceability, has provided novel approaches for resolving these issues. Both of these technologies independently hold vast potential for development; yet, their combination uncovers substantial cross-disciplinary opportunities and growth prospects. The current research tendencies are increasingly concentrating on the integration of blockchain with large language models, with the aim of compensating for their respective limitations through this fusion and promoting further technological evolution. In this study, we evaluate the advantages and developmental constraints of the two technologies, and explore the possibility and development potential of their combination. This paper primarily investigates the technical convergence in two directions: Firstly, the application of large language models to blockchain, where we identify six major development directions and explore solutions to the shortcomings of blockchain technology and their application scenarios; Secondly, the application of blockchain technology to large language models, leveraging the characteristics of blockchain to remedy the deficiencies of large language models and exploring its application potential in multiple fields.

This mechanism allows corrections during a grace period before immutability takes effect. We validated our approach using WineTracker, a Hyperledger Fabric-based supply chain application. It enables some users to cancel unwanted operations while preserving the blockchain security and maintaining data consistency.

Abstract: Users increasingly rely on identity providers for accessing online services and resources. However, centralized identity systems often compromise user privacy due to online activity tracking or data breaches. At the same time, many online services require digital copies of physical documents for validation in claims processes, such as providing proof of residence for opening a bank account or verifying medical images for health insurance claims. With centralized solutions, privacy depends entirely on the trusted party, but there are emerging decentralized approaches that offer greater transparency.
  This article introduces SoverClaim, a decentralized application prototype that empowers users to control their identity and also allows them to present digital documents with privacy. SoverClaim leverages Hyperledger Indy, a blockchain for issuing and presenting self-sovereign digital identities with transparent audit logs, and Storj, a decentralized peer-to-peer service, for secure and decentralized document storage and subsequent deletion. The prototype demonstrates the seamless integration of self-sovereign identities and document-based claims, achieving response times of under 750 ms, making it suitable for timely human interactions.

Abstract: Codes with specific characteristics are more exposed to security vulnerabilities. Studies have revealed that codes that do not adhere to best practices are more challenging to verify and maintain, increasing the likelihood of unnoticed or unintentionally introduced vulnerabilities. Given the crucial role of smart contracts in blockchain systems, ensuring their security and conducting thorough vulnerability analysis is critical. This study investigates the use of code complexity metrics as indicators of vulnerable code in Solidity smart contracts. We highlight the significance of complexity metrics as valuable complementary features for vulnerability assessment and provide insights into the individual power of each metric. By analyzing 21 complexity metrics, we explored their interrelation, association with vulnerability, discriminative power, and mean values in vulnerable versus neutral codes. The results revealed some high correlations and potential redundancies among certain metrics, but weak correlations between each independent metric and vulnerability. Nevertheless, we found that all metrics can effectively discriminate between vulnerable and neutral codes, and most complexity metrics, except for three, exhibited higher values in vulnerable codes.

Abstract: The centralization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses significant challenges, including single points of failure, inherent biases, data privacy concerns, and scalability issues. These problems are especially prevalent in closed-source large language models (LLMs), where user data is collected and used without transparency. To mitigate these issues, blockchain-based decentralized AI (DeAI) has emerged as a promising solution. DeAI combines the strengths of both blockchain and AI technologies to enhance the transparency, security, decentralization, and trustworthiness of AI systems. However, a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art DeAI development, particularly for active industry solutions, is still lacking. In this work, we present a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) for blockchain-based DeAI solutions. We propose a taxonomy to classify existing DeAI protocols based on the model lifecycle. Based on this taxonomy, we provide a structured way to clarify the landscape of DeAI protocols and identify their similarities and differences. We analyze the functionalities of blockchain in DeAI, investigating how blockchain features contribute to enhancing the security, transparency, and trustworthiness of AI processes, while also ensuring fair incentives for AI data and model contributors. In addition, we identify key insights and research gaps in developing DeAI protocols, highlighting several critical avenues for future research.

Abstract: This study investigated the factors contributing to the failure of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) startups in the emerging metaverse landscape. Through an in-depth analysis of 29 failed AR/VR startups from 2016 to 2022, key pitfalls were identified, such as a lack of scalability, poor usability, unclear value propositions, and the failure to address specific user problems. Grounded in these findings, we developed the Metaverse Innovation Canvas (MIC) a tailored business ideation framework for XR products and services. The canvas guides founders to define user problems, articulate unique XR value propositions, evaluate usability factors such as the motion-based interaction load, consider social/virtual economy opportunities, and plan for long term scalability. Unlike generalized models, specialized blocks prompt the consideration of critical XR factors from the outset. The canvas was evaluated through expert testing with startup consultants on five failed venture cases. The results highlighted the tool's effectiveness in surfacing overlooked usability issues and technology constraints upfront, enhancing the viability of future metaverse startups.

Abstract: Machine learning is critical for innovation and efficiency in financial markets, offering predictive models and data-driven decision-making. However, challenges such as missing data, lack of transparency, untimely updates, insecurity, and incompatible data sources limit its effectiveness. Blockchain technology, with its transparency, immutability, and real-time updates, addresses these challenges. We present a framework for integrating high-frequency on-chain data with low-frequency off-chain data, providing a benchmark for addressing novel research questions in economic mechanism design. This framework generates modular, extensible datasets for analyzing economic mechanisms such as the Transaction Fee Mechanism, enabling multi-modal insights and fairness-driven evaluations. Using four machine learning techniques, including linear regression, deep neural networks, XGBoost, and LSTM models, we demonstrate the framework's ability to produce datasets that advance financial research and improve understanding of blockchain-driven systems. Our contributions include: (1) proposing a research scenario for the Transaction Fee Mechanism and demonstrating how the framework addresses previously unexplored questions in economic mechanism design; (2) providing a benchmark for financial machine learning by open-sourcing a sample dataset generated by the framework and the code for the pipeline, enabling continuous dataset expansion; and (3) promoting reproducibility, transparency, and collaboration by fully open-sourcing the framework and its outputs. This initiative supports researchers in extending our work and developing innovative financial machine-learning models, fostering advancements at the intersection of machine learning, blockchain, and economics.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a scheme for detecting manipulated audio and video. The scheme is a synthesis of blockchains, encrypted spread spectrum watermarks, perceptual hashing and digital signatures, which we call an Embedded Blockchain. Within this scheme, we use the blockchain for its data structure of a cryptographically linked list, cryptographic hashing for absolute comparisons, perceptual hashing for flexible comparisons, digital signatures for proof of ownership, and encrypted spread spectrum watermarking to embed the blockchain into the background noise of the media. So each media recording has its own unique blockchain, with each block holding information describing the media segment. The problem of verifying the integrity of the media is recast to traversing the blockchain, block-by-block, and segment-by-segment of the media. If any chain is broken, the difference in the computed and extracted perceptual hash is used to estimate the level of manipulation.

Abstract: Value function factorization methods are commonly used in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, with QMIX receiving significant attention. Many QMIX-based methods introduce monotonicity constraints between the joint action value and individual action values to achieve decentralized execution. However, such constraints limit the representation capacity of value factorization, restricting the joint action values it can represent and hindering the learning of the optimal policy. To address this challenge, we propose the Potentially Optimal Joint Actions Weighted QMIX (POWQMIX) algorithm, which recognizes the potentially optimal joint actions and assigns higher weights to the corresponding losses of these joint actions during training. We theoretically prove that with such a weighted training approach the optimal policy is guaranteed to be recovered. Experiments in matrix games, difficulty-enhanced predator-prey, and StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge environments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.

Abstract: Vehicles today can drive themselves on highways and driverless robotaxis operate in major cities, with more sophisticated levels of autonomous driving expected to be available and become more common in the future. Yet, technically speaking, so-called "Level 5" (L5) operation, corresponding to full autonomy, has not been achieved. For that to happen, functions such as fully autonomous highway ramp entry must be available, and provide provably safe, and reliably robust behavior to enable full autonomy. We present a systematic study of a highway ramp function that controls the vehicles forward-moving actions to minimize collisions with the stream of highway traffic into which a merging (ego) vehicle enters. We take a game-theoretic multi-agent (MA) approach to this problem and study the use of controllers based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The virtual environment of the MA DRL uses self-play with simulated data where merging vehicles safely learn to control longitudinal position during a taper-type merge. The work presented in this paper extends existing work by studying the interaction of more than two vehicles (agents) and does so by systematically expanding the road scene with additional traffic and ego vehicles. While previous work on the two-vehicle setting established that collision-free controllers are theoretically impossible in fully decentralized, non-coordinated environments, we empirically show that controllers learned using our approach are nearly ideal when measured against idealized optimal controllers.

Abstract: We hypothesize that peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay network nodes can be attractive to attackers due to their visibility, sustained uptime, and resource potential. Towards validating this hypothesis, we investigate the state of active reconnaissance attacks on Ethereum P2P network nodes by deploying a series of honeypots alongside actual Ethereum nodes across globally distributed vantage points. We find that Ethereum nodes experience not only increased attacks, but also specific types of attacks targeting particular ports and services. Furthermore, we find evidence that the threat assessment on our nodes is applicable to the wider P2P network by having performed port scans on other reachable peers. Our findings provide insights into potential mitigation strategies to improve the security of the P2P networking layer.

Abstract: The conjunction of edge intelligence and the ever-growing Internet-of-Things (IoT) network heralds a new era of collaborative machine learning, with federated learning (FL) emerging as the most prominent paradigm. With the growing interest in these learning schemes, researchers started addressing some of their most fundamental limitations. Indeed, conventional FL with a central aggregator presents a single point of failure and a network bottleneck. To bypass this issue, decentralized FL where nodes collaborate in a peer-to-peer network has been proposed. Despite the latter's efficiency, communication costs and data heterogeneity remain key challenges in decentralized FL. In this context, we propose a novel scheme, called opportunistic communication-efficient decentralized federated learning, a.k.a., OCD-FL, consisting of a systematic FL peer selection for collaboration, aiming to achieve maximum FL knowledge gain while reducing energy consumption. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of OCD-FL to achieve similar or better performances than the fully collaborative FL, while significantly reducing consumed energy by at least 30% and up to 80%.

Abstract: We introduce an Implicit Game-Theoretic MPC (IGT-MPC), a decentralized algorithm for two-agent motion planning that uses a learned value function that predicts the game-theoretic interaction outcomes as the terminal cost-to-go function in a model predictive control (MPC) framework, guiding agents to implicitly account for interactions with other agents and maximize their reward. This approach applies to competitive and cooperative multi-agent motion planning problems which we formulate as constrained dynamic games. Given a constrained dynamic game, we randomly sample initial conditions and solve for the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) to generate a dataset of GNE solutions, computing the reward outcome of each game-theoretic interaction from the GNE. The data is used to train a simple neural network to predict the reward outcome, which we use as the terminal cost-to-go function in an MPC scheme. We showcase emerging competitive and coordinated behaviors using IGT-MPC in scenarios such as two-vehicle head-to-head racing and un-signalized intersection navigation. IGT-MPC offers a novel method integrating machine learning and game-theoretic reasoning into model-based decentralized multi-agent motion planning.

We also propose a reference multi-connectivity management method named Enhanced MAX-SINR, designed to advance research in blockchain-specific approaches, taking into account retransmission successfull rates. We evaluate blockchain performance in diverse environments such as urban, suburban, and rural areas, demonstrating that enhancing the success rate of retransmitted blockchain-related messages significantly boosts blockchain transaction performance and provides a foundation for developing intelligent SIoV systems.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of performing multi-label classification in the case of extremely heterogeneous data and with decentralized Machine Learning. Solving this issue is very important in IoT scenarios, where data coming from various sources, collected by heterogeneous devices, serve the learning of a distributed ML model through Federated Learning (FL). Specifically, we focus on the combination of FL applied to Human Activity Recognition HAR), where the task is to detect which kind of movements or actions individuals perform. In this case, transitioning from centralized learning (CL) to federated learning is non-trivial as HAR displays heterogeneity in action and devices, leading to significant skews in label and feature distributions. We address this scenario by presenting concrete solutions and tools for transitioning from centralized to FL for non-IID scenarios, outlining the main design decisions that need to be taken. Leveraging an open-sourced HAR dataset, we experimentally evaluate the effects that data augmentation, scaling, optimizer, learning rate, and batch size choices have on the performance of resulting machine learning models. Some of our main findings include using SGD-m as an optimizer, global feature scaling across clients, and persistent feature skew in the presence of heterogeneous HAR data. Finally, we provide an open-source extension of the Flower framework that enables asynchronous FL.

Abstract: This paper concerns control of a class of systems where multiple dynamically stable agents share a nonlinear and bounded control-interconnection. The agents are subject to a disturbance which is too large to reject with the available control action, making it impossible to stabilize all agents in their desired states. In this nonlinear setting, we consider two different anti-windup equipped proportional-integral control strategies and analyze their properties. We show that a fully decentralized strategy will globally, asymptotically stabilize a unique equilibrium. This equilibrium also minimizes a weighted sum of the tracking errors. We also consider a light addition to the fully decentralized strategy, where rank-1 coordination between the agents is introduced via the anti-windup action. We show that any equilibrium to this closed-loop system minimizes the maximum tracking error for any agent. A remarkable property of these results is that they rely on extremely few assumptions on the interconnection between the agents. Finally we illustrate how the considered model can be applied in a district heating setting, and demonstrate the two considered controllers in a simulation.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in decentralized networked systems is to coordinate actions of different agents so that they reach a state of agreement. In such applications, it is additionally desirable that the actions at various nodes may not be anticipated by malicious eavesdroppers. Motivated by this, we investigate the problem of secure multi-terminal strong coordination aided by a multiple-access wiretap channel. In this setup, independent and identically distributed copies of correlated sources are observed by two transmitters who encode the channel inputs to the MAC-WT. The legitimate receiver observing the channel output and side information correlated with the sources must produce approximately i.i.d. copies of an output variable jointly distributed with the sources. Furthermore, we demand that an external eavesdropper learns essentially nothin g about the sources and the simulated output sequence by observing its own MAC-WT output. This setting is aided by the presence of independent pairwise shared randomness between each encoder and the legitimate decoder, that is unavailable to the eavesdropper. We derive an achievable rate region based on a combination of coordination coding and wiretap coding, along with an outer bound. The inner bound is shown to be tight and a complete characterization is derived for the special case when the sources are conditionally independent given the decoder side information and the legitimate channel is composed of deterministic links. Further, we also analyze a more general scenario with possible encoder cooperation, where one of the encoders can non-causally crib from the other encoders input, for which an achievable rate region is proposed. We then explicitly compute the rate regions for an example both with and without cribbing between the encoders, and demonstrate that cribbing strictly improves upon the achievable rate region.

Abstract: Cooperative Distributed Model Predictive Control (DiMPC) architecture employs local MPC controllers to control different subsystems, exchanging information with each other through an iterative procedure to enhance overall control performance compared to the decentralized architecture. However, this method can result in high communication between the controllers and computational costs. In this work, the amount of information exchanged and the computational costs of DiMPC are reduced significantly by developing novel iteration-free solution algorithms based on multiparametric (mp) programming. These algorithms replace the iterative procedure with simultaneous solutions of explicit mpDiMPC control law functions. The reduced communication among local controllers decreases system latency, which is crucial for real-time control applications. The effectiveness of the proposed iteration-free mpDiMPC algorithms is demonstrated through comprehensive numerical simulations involving groups of coupled linear subsystems, which are interconnected through their inputs and a cooperative plant-wide cost function.

Abstract: In modern times, the cryptocurrency market is one of the world's most rapidly rising financial markets. The cryptocurrency market is regarded to be more volatile and illiquid than traditional markets such as equities, foreign exchange, and commodities. The risk of this market creates an uncertain condition among the investors. The purpose of this research is to predict the magnitude of the risk factor of the cryptocurrency market. Risk factor is also called volatility. Our approach will assist people who invest in the cryptocurrency market by overcoming the problems and difficulties they experience. Our approach starts with calculating the risk factor of the cryptocurrency market from the existing parameters. In twenty elements of the cryptocurrency market, the risk factor has been predicted using different machine learning algorithms such as CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU. All of the models have been applied to the calculated risk factor parameter. A new model has been developed to predict better than the existing models. Our proposed model gives the highest RMSE value of 1.3229 and the lowest RMSE value of 0.0089. Following our model, it will be easier for investors to trade in complicated and challenging financial assets like bitcoin, Ethereum, dogecoin, etc. Where the other existing models, the highest RMSE was 14.5092, and the lower was 0.02769. So, the proposed model performs much better than models with proper generalization. Using our approach, it will be easier for investors to trade in complicated and challenging financial assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin.

Abstract: This paper studies decentralized bilevel optimization, in which multiple agents collaborate to solve problems involving nested optimization structures with neighborhood communications. Most existing literature primarily utilizes gradient tracking to mitigate the influence of data heterogeneity, without exploring other well-known heterogeneity-correction techniques such as EXTRA or Exact Diffusion. Additionally, these studies often employ identical decentralized strategies for both upper- and lower-level problems, neglecting to leverage distinct mechanisms across different levels. To address these limitations, this paper proposes SPARKLE, a unified Single-loop Primal-dual AlgoRithm frameworK for decentraLized bilEvel optimization. SPARKLE offers the flexibility to incorporate various heterogeneitycorrection strategies into the algorithm. Moreover, SPARKLE allows for different strategies to solve upper- and lower-level problems. We present a unified convergence analysis for SPARKLE, applicable to all its variants, with state-of-the-art convergence rates compared to existing decentralized bilevel algorithms. Our results further reveal that EXTRA and Exact Diffusion are more suitable for decentralized bilevel optimization, and using mixed strategies in bilevel algorithms brings more benefits than relying solely on gradient tracking.

Abstract: This article explores public perceptions on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) through an analysis of social media discourse across six European countries. Using sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques on a dataset of tweets and media articles, we assess how the public reacts to the integration of technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and blockchain into society. The results highlight a significant polarization of opinions, with a shift from neutral to more definitive stances either embracing or resisting technological impacts. Positive sentiments are often associated with technological enhancements in quality of life and economic opportunities, whereas concerns focus on issues of privacy, data security, and ethical implications. This polarization underscores the need for policymakers to engage proactively with the public to address fears and harness the benefits of 4IR technologies. The findings also advocate for digital literacy and public awareness programs to mitigate misinformation and foster an informed public discourse on future technological integration. This study contributes to the ongoing debate on aligning technological advances with societal values and needs, emphasizing the role of informed public opinion in shaping effective policy.

Abstract: Data markets facilitate decentralized data exchange for applications such as prediction, learning, or inference. The design of these markets is challenged by varying privacy preferences as well as data similarity among data owners. Related works have often overlooked how data similarity impacts pricing and data value through statistical information leakage. We demonstrate that data similarity and privacy preferences are integral to market design and propose a query-response protocol using local differential privacy for a two-party data acquisition mechanism. In our regression data market model, we analyze strategic interactions between privacy-aware owners and the learner as a Stackelberg game over the asked price and privacy factor. Finally, we numerically evaluate how data similarity affects market participation and traded data value.

Abstract: An input-output approach to stability analysis is explored for networked systems with uncertain link dynamics. The main result consists of a collection of integral quadratic constraints, which together imply robust stability of the uncertain networked system, under the assumption that stability is achieved with ideal links. The conditions are decentralized inasmuch as each involves only agent and uncertainty model parameters that are local to a corresponding link. This makes the main result, which imposes no restriction on network structure, suitable for the study of large-scale systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) environments has created an urgent need for secure and trustworthy distributed computing systems, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous devices and applications where centralized trust cannot be assumed. This paper proposes TrustMesh, a novel blockchain-enabled framework that addresses these challenges through a unique three-layer architecture combining permissioned blockchain technology with a novel multi-phase Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus protocol. The key innovation lies in TrustMesh's ability to support non-deterministic scheduling algorithms while maintaining Byzantine fault tolerance - features traditionally considered mutually exclusive in blockchain systems. The framework supports a sophisticated resource management approach that enables flexible scheduling decisions while preserving the security guarantees of blockchain-based verification. Our experimental evaluation using a real-world cold chain monitoring scenario demonstrates that TrustMesh successfully maintains Byzantine fault tolerance with fault detection latencies under 150 milliseconds, while maintaining consistent framework overhead across varying computational workloads even with network scaling. These results establish TrustMesh's effectiveness in balancing security, performance, and flexibility requirements in trustless IoT environments, advancing the state-of-the-art in secure distributed computing frameworks.

Abstract: In an era of heightened digital interconnectedness, businesses increasingly rely on third-party vendors to enhance their operational capabilities. However, this growing dependency introduces significant security risks, making it crucial to develop a robust framework to mitigate potential vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a comprehensive secure framework for managing third-party vendor risk, integrating blockchain technology to ensure transparency, traceability, and immutability in vendor assessments and interactions. By leveraging blockchain, the framework enhances the integrity of vendor security audits, ensuring that vendor assessments remain up-to-date and tamperproof. This proposed framework leverages smart contracts to reduce human error while ensuring real-time monitoring of compliance and security controls. By evaluating critical security controls-such as data encryption, access control mechanisms, multi-factor authentication, and zero-trust architecture-this approach strengthens an organization's defense against emerging cyber threats. Additionally, continuous monitoring enabled by blockchain ensures the immutability and transparency of vendor compliance processes. In this paper, a case study on iHealth's transition to AWS Cloud demonstrates the practical implementation of the framework, showing a significant reduction in vulnerabilities and marked improvement in incident response times. Through the adoption of this blockchain-enabled approach, organizations can mitigate vendor risks, streamline compliance, and enhance their overall security posture.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a key tool in financial markets, helping to predict asset prices and guide investment decisions. In highly volatile markets, such as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), forecasting becomes more difficult due to extreme price fluctuations driven by market sentiment, technological changes, and regulatory shifts. Traditionally, forecasting relied on statistical methods, but as markets became more complex, deep learning models like LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and the newer FinBERT-LSTM emerged to capture intricate patterns. Building upon recent advancements and addressing the volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets, we propose a hybrid model that combines Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks with FinBERT to enhance forecasting accuracy for these assets. This approach fills a key gap in forecasting volatile financial markets by blending advanced time series models with sentiment analysis, offering valuable insights for investors and analysts navigating unpredictable markets.

Abstract: This research work introduces a novel approach to the classification of Alzheimer's disease by using the advanced deep learning techniques combined with secure data processing methods. This research work primary uses transfer learning models such as ResNet, ImageNet, and VNet to extract high-level features from medical image data. Thereafter, these pre-trained models were fine-tuned for Alzheimer's related subtle patterns such that the model is capable of robust feature extraction over varying data sources. Further, the federated learning approaches were incorporated to tackle a few other challenges related to classification, aimed to provide better prediction performance and protect data privacy. The proposed model was built using federated learning without sharing sensitive patient data. This way, the decentralized model benefits from the large and diversified dataset that it is trained upon while ensuring confidentiality. The cipher-based encryption mechanism is added that allows us to secure the transportation of data and further ensure the privacy and integrity of patient information throughout training and classification. The results of the experiments not only help to improve the accuracy of the classification of Alzheimer's but at the same time provides a framework for secure and collaborative analysis of health care data.

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of decentralized machine learning (ML) ecosystems, we study the delegation of data collection. Taking the field of contract theory as our starting point, we design optimal and near-optimal contracts that deal with two fundamental information asymmetries that arise in decentralized ML: uncertainty in the assessment of model quality and uncertainty regarding the optimal performance of any model. We show that a principal can cope with such asymmetry via simple linear contracts that achieve 1-1/e fraction of the optimal utility. To address the lack of a priori knowledge regarding the optimal performance, we give a convex program that can adaptively and efficiently compute the optimal contract. We also study linear contracts and derive the optimal utility in the more complex setting of multiple interactions.

Abstract: Accurate ground reaction force (GRF) estimation can significantly improve the adaptability of legged robots in various real-world applications. For instance, with estimated GRF and contact kinematics, the locomotion control and planning assist the robot in overcoming uncertain terrains. The canonical momentum-based methods, formulated as nonlinear observers, do not fully address the noisy measurements and the dependence between floating base states and the generalized momentum dynamics. In this paper, we present a simultaneous ground reaction force and state estimation framework for legged robots, which systematically addresses the sensor noise and the coupling between states and dynamics. With the floating base orientation estimated separately, a decentralized Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) method is implemented to fuse the robot dynamics, proprioceptive sensors, exteroceptive sensors, and deterministic contact complementarity constraints in a convex windowed optimization. The proposed method is shown to be capable of providing accurate GRF and state estimation on several legged robots, including the open-source educational planar bipedal robot STRIDE and quadrupedal robot Unitree Go1, with a frequency of 200Hz and a past time window of 0.04s.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while preserving local data privacy, making it ideal for mobile and embedded systems. However, the decentralized nature of FL also opens vulnerabilities to model poisoning attacks, particularly backdoor attacks, where adversaries implant trigger patterns to manipulate model predictions. In this paper, we propose DeTrigger, a scalable and efficient backdoor-robust federated learning framework that leverages insights from adversarial attack methodologies. By employing gradient analysis with temperature scaling, DeTrigger detects and isolates backdoor triggers, allowing for precise model weight pruning of backdoor activations without sacrificing benign model knowledge. Extensive evaluations across four widely used datasets demonstrate that DeTrigger achieves up to 251x faster detection than traditional methods and mitigates backdoor attacks by up to 98.9%, with minimal impact on global model accuracy. Our findings establish DeTrigger as a robust and scalable solution to protect federated learning environments against sophisticated backdoor threats.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized learning approach that protects sensitive information by utilizing local model parameters rather than sharing clients' raw datasets. While this privacy-preserving method is widely employed across various applications, it still requires significant development and optimization. Automated Machine Learning (Auto-ML) has been adapted for reducing the need for manual adjustments. Previous studies have explored the integration of AutoML with different FL algorithms to evaluate their effectiveness in enhancing FL settings. However, Automated FL (Auto-FL) faces additional challenges due to the involvement of a large cohort of clients and global training rounds between clients and the server, rendering the tuning process time-consuming and nearly impossible on resource-constrained edge devices (e.g., IoT devices). This paper investigates the deployment and integration of two lightweight Hyper-Parameter Optimization (HPO) tools, Raytune and Optuna, within the context of FL settings. A step-wise feedback mechanism has also been designed to accelerate the hyper-parameter tuning process and coordinate AutoML toolkits with the FL server. To this end, both local and global feedback mechanisms are integrated to limit the search space and expedite the HPO process. Further, a novel client selection technique is introduced to mitigate the straggler effect in Auto-FL. The selected hyper-parameter tuning tools are evaluated using two benchmark datasets, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10. Further, the paper discusses the essential properties of successful HPO tools, the integration mechanism with the FL pipeline, and the challenges posed by the distributed and heterogeneous nature of FL environments.

Abstract: Next-generation mobile networks require evolved radio access network (RAN) architectures to meet the demands of high capacity, massive connectivity, reduced costs, and energy efficiency, and to realize communication with ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliability. {Meeting such} requirements for both mobile users and vertical industries in the next decade {requires novel solutions. One of the potential solutions that attracted significant research attention in the past 15 years} is to redesign the radio access network (RAN). In this survey, we present a comprehensive survey on distributed antenna system (DAS) architectures that address these challenges and improve network performance. We cover the transition from traditional decentralized RAN to DAS, including cloud radio-access networks (C-RAN), fog radio-access networks (F-RAN), virtualized radio-access networks (V-RAN), cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO), and {the most recent advances manifested in} open radio-access network (O-RAN). In the process, we discuss the benefits and limitations of these architectures, including the impact of limited-capacity fronthaul links, various cooperative uplink and downlink coding strategies, cross-layer optimization, and techniques to optimize the performance of DAS. Moreover, we review key enabling technologies for next-generation RAN systems, such as multi-access edge computing, network function virtualization, software-defined networking, and network slicing; in addition to some crucial radio access technologies, such as millimeter wave, massive multi-input multi-output, device-to-device communication, and massive machine-type communication. Last but not least, we discuss the major research challenges in DAS and identify several possible directions for future research.

Abstract: As legged robots take on roles in industrial and autonomous construction, collaborative loco-manipulation is crucial for handling large and heavy objects that exceed the capabilities of a single robot. However, ensuring the safety of these multi-robot tasks is essential to prevent accidents and guarantee reliable operation. This paper presents a hierarchical control system for object manipulation using a team of quadrupedal robots. The combination of the motion planner and the decentralized locomotion controller in a hierarchical structure enables safe, adaptive planning for teams in complex scenarios. A high-level nonlinear model predictive control planner generates collision-free paths by incorporating control barrier functions, accounting for static and dynamic obstacles. This process involves calculating contact points and forces while adapting to unknown objects and terrain properties. The decentralized loco-manipulation controller then ensures each robot maintains stable locomotion and manipulation based on the planner's guidance. The effectiveness of our method is carefully examined in simulations under various conditions and validated in real-life setups with robot hardware. By modifying the object's configuration, the robot team can maneuver unknown objects through an environment containing both static and dynamic obstacles. We have made our code publicly available in an open-source repository at \url{https://github.com/DRCL-USC/collaborative_loco_manipulation}.

Abstract: Parked-assisted vehicular edge computing (PVEC) fully leverages communication and computing resources of parking vehicles, thereby significantly alleviating the pressure on edge servers. However, resource sharing and trading for vehicular task offloading in the PVEC environment usually occur between untrustworthy entities, which compromises the security of data sharing and transactions by vehicles and edge devices. To address these concerns, blockchain is introduced to provide a secure and trustworthy environment for offloading and transactions in PVEC. Nevertheless, due to the mobility of the vehicles, the processes of computing offloading and blockchain transactions are interrupted, which greatly reduces the reliability of the blockchain in edge computing process. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based PVEC (BPVEC) offloading framework to enhance the security and reliability of the task offloading and transaction. Specifically, a consensus node selection algorithm based on the connected dominating set (CDS) is designed to improve the Hotstuff consensus according to parking time, computing capability and communication quality, which enhances blockchain reliability in computing offloading and transactions. Meanwhile, a Stackelberg game model, establishing the roadside units (RSUs) and parking vehicles (PVs) as leaders and the requesting vehicles (RVs) as follower, is utilized to optimize the offloading strategy and pricing. Subsequently, a BPVEC offloading strategy algorithm with gradient descent method is designed to maximize system revenue. Simulation results show that the proposed BPVEC offloading scheme is secure and reliable while ensuring maximum benefits.

Abstract: In decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning, agents learning in isolation can lead to relative over-generalization (RO), where optimal joint actions are undervalued in favor of suboptimal ones. This hinders effective coordination in cooperative tasks, as agents tend to choose actions that are individually rational but collectively suboptimal. To address this issue, we introduce MaxMax Q-Learning (MMQ), which employs an iterative process of sampling and evaluating potential next states, selecting those with maximal Q-values for learning. This approach refines approximations of ideal state transitions, aligning more closely with the optimal joint policy of collaborating agents. We provide theoretical analysis supporting MMQ's potential and present empirical evaluations across various environments susceptible to RO. Our results demonstrate that MMQ frequently outperforms existing baselines, exhibiting enhanced convergence and sample efficiency.

Abstract: This work investigates the self-organization of multi-agent systems into closed trajectories, a common requirement in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveillance tasks. In such scenarios, smooth, unbiased control signals save energy and mitigate mechanical strain. We propose a decentralized control system architecture that produces a globally stable emergent structure from local observations only; there is no requirement for agents to share a global plan or follow prescribed trajectories. Central to our approach is the formulation of an injective virtual embedding induced by rotations from the actual agent positions. This embedding serves as a structure-preserving map around which all agent stabilize their relative positions and permits the use of well-established linear control techniques. We construct the embedding such that it is topologically equivalent to the desired trajectory (i.e., a homeomorphism), thereby preserving the stability characteristics. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach through implementation on a swarm of Quanser QDrone quadcopters. Results demonstrate the quadcopters self-organize into the desired trajectory while maintaining even separation.

Abstract: This paper investigates the role of communication in improving coordination within robot swarms, focusing on a paradigm where learning and execution occur simultaneously in a decentralized manner. We highlight the role communication can play in addressing the credit assignment problem (individual contribution to the overall performance), and how it can be influenced by it. We propose a taxonomy of existing and future works on communication, focusing on information selection and physical abstraction as principal axes for classification: from low-level lossless compression with raw signal extraction and processing to high-level lossy compression with structured communication models. The paper reviews current research from evolutionary robotics, multi-agent (deep) reinforcement learning, language models, and biophysics models to outline the challenges and opportunities of communication in a collective of robots that continuously learn from one another through local message exchanges, illustrating a form of social learning.

Abstract: Federated Named Entity Recognition (FNER) boosts model training within each local client by aggregating the model updates of decentralized local clients, without sharing their private data. However, existing FNER methods assume fixed entity types and local clients in advance, leading to their ineffectiveness in practical applications. In a more realistic scenario, local clients receive new entity types continuously, while new local clients collecting novel data may irregularly join the global FNER training. This challenging setup, referred to here as Federated Incremental NER, renders the global model suffering from heterogeneous forgetting of old entity types from both intra-client and inter-client perspectives. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Local-Global Forgetting Defense (LGFD) model. Specifically, to address intra-client forgetting, we develop a structural knowledge distillation loss to retain the latent space's feature structure and a pseudo-label-guided inter-type contrastive loss to enhance discriminative capability over different entity types, effectively preserving previously learned knowledge within local clients. To tackle inter-client forgetting, we propose a task switching monitor that can automatically identify new entity types under privacy protection and store the latest old global model for knowledge distillation and pseudo-labeling. Experiments demonstrate significant improvement of our LGFD model over comparison methods.

Abstract: Sequential learning in a multi-agent resource constrained matching market has received significant interest in the past few years. We study decentralized learning in two-sided matching markets where the demand side (aka players or agents) competes for a `large' supply side (aka arms) with potentially time-varying preferences, to obtain a stable match. Despite a long line of work in the recent past, existing learning algorithms such as Explore-Then-Commit or Upper-Confidence-Bound remain inefficient for this problem. In particular, the per-agent regret achieved by these algorithms scales linearly with the number of arms, $K$. Motivated by the linear contextual bandit framework, we assume that for each agent an arm-mean can be represented by a linear function of a known feature vector and an unknown (agent-specific) parameter.
  Moreover, our setup captures the essence of a dynamic (non-stationary) matching market where the preferences over arms change over time. Our proposed algorithms achieve instance-dependent logarithmic regret, scaling independently of the number of arms, $K$.

Abstract: Blockchain technology ensures secure and trustworthy data flow between multiple participants on the chain, but interoperability of on-chain and off-chain data has always been a difficult problem that needs to be solved. To solve the problem that blockchain systems cannot access off-chain data, oracle is introduced. However, existing research mainly focuses on the consistency and integrity of data, but ignores the problem that oracle nodes may be externally attacked or provide false data for selfish motives, resulting in the unresolved problem of data accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a new Decentralized Testing architecture (DecTest) that aims to improve data accuracy. A blockchain oracle random secret testing mechanism is first proposed to enhance the monitoring and verification of nodes by introducing a dynamic anonymized question-verification committee. Based on this, a comprehensive evaluation incentive mechanism is designed to incentivize honest work performance by evaluating nodes based on their reputation scores. The simulation results show that we successfully reduced the discrete entropy value of the acquired data and the real value of the data by 61.4%.

Abstract: Cloud computing and edge/fog computing are playing a pivotal role in driving the transformation of industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) towards greater intelligence and automation by providing high-quality computation offloading services to Internet of Things devices (IoTDs). Recently, space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIMEC) is emerging as a promising architecture combining edge computing and cloud computing, which has the potential to be integrated with ICPS to accelerate the realization of the above vision. In this work, we first present an SAGIMEC-assisted ICPS architecture that incorporates edge computing and cloud computing through seamless connectivity supported by satellite networks to achieve determinism in connectivity, networked computing, and intelligent networked control. Then, we formulate a joint satellite selection, computation offloading, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control optimization problem (JSC4OP) to maximize the quality of service (QoS) of IoTDs. This problem considers both the dynamics and uncertainties of the system environment, as well as the limited resources and energy of UAVs. Given the complexity of JSC4OP, we propose an online decentralized optimization approach (ODOA) to solve the problem. Specifically, JSC4OP is first transformed into a real-time decision-making optimization problem (RDOP) by leveraging Lyapunov optimization. Then, to solve the RDOP, we introduce an online learning-based latency prediction method to predict the uncertain system environment and a game theoretic decision-making method to make real-time decisions. Finally, theoretical analysis confirms the effectiveness of the ODOA, while the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ODOA outperforms other alternative approaches in terms of overall system performance.

Abstract: Graphs, consisting of vertices and edges, are vital for representing complex relationships in fields like social networks, finance, and blockchain. Visualizing these graphs helps analysts identify structural patterns, with readability metrics-such as node occlusion and edge crossing-assessing layout clarity. However, calculating these metrics is computationally intensive, making scalability a challenge for large graphs. Without efficient readability metrics, layout generation processes-despite numerous studies focused on accelerating them-face bottleneck, making it challenging to select or produce optimized layouts swiftly. Previous approaches attempted to accelerate this process through machine learning models. Machine learning approaches aimed to predict readability scores from rendered images of graphs. While these models offered some improvement, they struggled with scalability and accuracy, especially for graphs with thousands of nodes. For instance, this approach requires substantial memory to process large images, as it relies on rendered images of the graph; graphs with more than 600 nodes cannot be inputted into the model, and errors can exceed 55% in some readability metrics due to difficulties in generalizing across diverse graph layouts. This study addresses these limitations by introducing scalable algorithms for readability evaluation in distributed environments, utilizing Spark's DataFrame and GraphFrame frameworks to efficiently manage large data volumes across multiple machines. Experimental results show that these distributed algorithms significantly reduce computation time, achieving up to a 17x speedup for node occlusion and a 146x improvement for edge crossing on large datasets. These enhancements make scalable graph readability evaluation practical and efficient, overcoming the limitations of previous machine-learning approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we present FedRewind, a novel approach to decentralized federated learning that leverages model exchange among nodes to address the issue of data distribution shift. Drawing inspiration from continual learning (CL) principles and cognitive neuroscience theories for memory retention, FedRewind implements a decentralized routing mechanism where nodes send/receive models to/from other nodes in the federation to address spatial distribution challenges inherent in distributed learning (FL). During local training, federation nodes periodically send their models back (i.e., rewind) to the nodes they received them from for a limited number of iterations. This strategy reduces the distribution shift between nodes' data, leading to enhanced learning and generalization performance. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority over standard decentralized federated learning methods and those enforcing specific routing schemes within the federation. Furthermore, the combination of federated and continual learning concepts enables our method to tackle the more challenging federated continual learning task, with data shifts over both space and time, surpassing existing baselines.

Abstract: Robot swarms have the potential to help groups of people with social tasks, given their ability to scale to large numbers of robots and users. Developing multi-human-swarm interaction is therefore crucial to support multiple people interacting with the swarm simultaneously - which is an area that is scarcely researched, unlike single-human, single-robot or single-human, multi-robot interaction. Moreover, most robots are still confined to laboratory settings. In this paper, we present our work with MOSAIX, a swarm of robot Tiles, that facilitated ideation at a science museum. 63 robots were used as a swarm of smart sticky notes, collecting input from the public and aggregating it based on themes, providing an evolving visualization tool that engaged visitors and fostered their participation. Our contribution lies in creating a large-scale (63 robots and 294 attendees) public event, with a completely decentralized swarm system in real-life settings.

Abstract: Distributed ledger systems, such as blockchains, rely on consensus protocols that constantly commit messages in an agreed order for processing. In practice, message ordering within these systems is often reward-driven. This raises concerns about fairness, particularly in decentralized finance applications, where nodes can exploit transaction orders to maximize rewards (Maximal Extractable Value, MEV). This paper provides a structured review of consensus protocols that order messages with different approaches, especially focusing on the ones that promote order fairness, using methods including First-In-First-Out (FIFO), random, and blind ordering. We review the challenges and trade-offs of deriving fair message ordering in a Byzantine fault-tolerant setting, and summarize the key steps for making a fair message ordering consensus protocol. We introduce a design guideline, with which we propose a performance optimization to the state-of-the-art FIFO ordering protocol Themis. This work establishes a unified framework for accessing and enhancing fairness in distributed ledger systems.

Abstract: In recent years, security incidents stemming from centralization defects in smart contracts have led to substantial financial losses. A centralization defect refers to any error, flaw, or fault in a smart contract's design or development stage that introduces a single point of failure. Such defects allow a specific account or user to disrupt the normal operations of smart contracts, potentially causing malfunctions or even complete project shutdowns. Despite the significance of this issue, most current smart contract analyses overlook centralization defects, focusing primarily on other types of defects. To address this gap, our paper introduces six types of centralization defects in smart contracts by manually analyzing 597 Stack Exchange posts and 117 audit reports. For each defect, we provide a detailed description and code examples to illustrate its characteristics and potential impacts. Additionally, we introduce a tool named CDRipper (Centralization Defects Ripper) designed to identify the defined centralization defects. Specifically, CDRipper constructs a permission dependency graph (PDG) and extracts the permission dependencies of functions from the source code of smart contracts. It then detects the sensitive operations in functions and identifies centralization defects based on predefined patterns. We conduct a large-scale experiment using CDRipper on 244,424 real-world smart contracts and evaluate the results based on a manually labeled dataset. Our findings reveal that 82,446 contracts contain at least one of the six centralization defects, with our tool achieving an overall precision of 93.7%.

Abstract: In this paper, a data-driven approach is developed for controller design for a class of discrete-time large-scale systems, where a large-scale system can be expressed in an equivalent data-driven form and the decentralized controllers can be parameterized by the data collected from its subsystems, i.e., system state, control input, and interconnection input. Based on the developed data-driven method and the Lyapunov approach, a data-driven semi-definite programming problem is constructed to obtain decentralized stabilizing controllers. The proposed approach has been validated on a mass-spring chain model, with the significant advantage of avoiding extensive modeling processes.

本文介绍了关于比特币网络中自然分叉的研究，其频率作为分布式账本效率的关键指标，可能导致资源浪费和网络安全问题。研究提出了一种模型，用于预测具有不同矿工数量、哈希率分布以及块传播时间的异质矿工网络中的自然分叉率。该模型预测的分叉率与实测的废弃区块率相当。过去十年间，采矿池的数量大约减少了三分之一，论文量化了这一变化对分叉率的影响，并揭示了由于全球能源供应限制导致的哈希率分布呈现截尾幂律分布的现象。文章通过实证分析和定量模型证明，块传播时间和挖矿时间的比例是评估分叉率的一个准确指标，并进一步量化了它对矿工活动异质性的依赖。此外，文中提供了理论和实证证据表明，哈希率集中度降低和块传播时间缩短可以减少分布式账本中的分叉率。这项工作为研究分布式网络上的权力集中和竞争提供了一个稳健的数学框架，有助于解释由自私挖矿策略和不对称传播时间引起的分叉率差异，从而为现有和新兴区块链分布式挖掘系统的未来设计提供了有效的工具。 <div>

Abstract: Forks in the Bitcoin network result from the natural competition in the blockchain's Proof-of-Work consensus protocol. Their frequency is a critical indicator for the efficiency of a distributed ledger as they can contribute to resource waste and network insecurity. We introduce a model for the estimation of natural fork rates in a network of heterogeneous miners as a function of their number, the distribution of hash rates and the block propagation time over the peer-to-peer infrastructure. Despite relatively simplistic assumptions, such as zero propagation delay within mining pools, the model predicts fork rates which are comparable with the empirical stale blocks rate. In the past decade, we observe a reduction in the number of mining pools approximately by a factor 3, and quantify its consequences for the fork rate, whilst showing the emergence of a truncated power-law distribution in hash rates, justified by a rich-get-richer effect constrained by global energy supply limits. We demonstrate, both empirically and with the aid of our quantitative model, that the ratio between the block propagation time and the mining time is a sufficiently accurate estimator of the fork rate, but also quantify its dependence on the heterogeneity of miner activities. We provide empirical and theoretical evidence that both hash rate concentration and lower block propagation time reduce fork rates in distributed ledgers. Our work introduces a robust mathematical setting for investigating power concentration and competition on a distributed network, for interpreting discrepancies in fork rates -- for example caused by selfish mining practices and asymmetric propagation times -- thus providing an effective tool for designing future and alternative scenarios for existing and new blockchain distributed mining systems.

Abstract: Bitcoin, launched in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, established a new digital economy where value can be stored and transferred in a fully decentralized manner - alleviating the need for a central authority. This paper introduces a large scale dataset in the form of a transactions graph representing transactions between Bitcoin users along with a set of tasks and baselines. The graph includes 252 million nodes and 785 million edges, covering a time span of nearly 13 years of and 670 million transactions. Each node and edge is timestamped. As for supervised tasks we provide two labeled sets i. a 33,000 nodes based on entity type and ii. nearly 100,000 Bitcoin addresses labeled with an entity name and an entity type. This is the largest publicly available data set of bitcoin transactions designed to facilitate advanced research and exploration in this domain, overcoming the limitations of existing datasets. Various graph neural network models are trained to predict node labels, establishing a baseline for future research. In addition, several use cases are presented to demonstrate the dataset's applicability beyond Bitcoin analysis. Finally, all data and source code is made publicly available to enable reproducibility of the results.

本文介绍了自动化标记制造商（AMMs）和集中流动性市场制造商（CLMMs），这是一种允许自动交易数字资产并由流动性提供者（LPs）提供存款的去中心化交易所。研究重点在于CLMMs中LPs的战略规划与激励机制。文章构建了一个博弈论模型分析LPs的行为，并发现原问题可能存在多个纳什均衡且复杂度随价格刻度数量呈二次增长，但可简化为具有唯一纳什均衡、复杂度线性增长的游戏。简化后的纳什均衡表现为低预算LP会使用全部预算，而富裕LP则不会完全投入。通过对真实世界CLMM数据的拟合，观察到在含有风险资产的流动资金池中，LPs的投资策略远离纳什均衡，他们倾向于在更少且更宽的价格范围内投资，并减少流动性更新频率。研究进一步表明，如果LPs调整其策略以更接近游戏的纳什均衡，他们的日均收益可提高约116美元，即日投资回报率中位数增加0.009%。 <div>

Abstract: Automated marker makers (AMMs) are a class of decentralized exchanges that enable the automated trading of digital assets. They accept deposits of digital tokens from liquidity providers (LPs); tokens can be used by traders to execute trades, which generate fees for the investing LPs. The distinguishing feature of AMMs is that trade prices are determined algorithmically, unlike classical limit order books. Concentrated liquidity market makers (CLMMs) are a major class of AMMs that offer liquidity providers flexibility to decide not only \emph{how much} liquidity to provide, but \emph{in what ranges of prices} they want the liquidity to be used. This flexibility can complicate strategic planning, since fee rewards are shared among LPs. We formulate and analyze a game theoretic model to study the incentives of LPs in CLMMs. Our main results show that while our original formulation admits multiple Nash equilibria and has complexity quadratic in the number of price ticks in the contract, it can be reduced to a game with a unique Nash equilibrium whose complexity is only linear. We further show that the Nash equilibrium of this simplified game follows a waterfilling strategy, in which low-budget LPs use up their full budget, but rich LPs do not. Finally, by fitting our game model to real-world CLMMs, we observe that in liquidity pools with risky assets, LPs adopt investment strategies far from the Nash equilibrium. Under price uncertainty, they generally invest in fewer and wider price ranges than our analysis suggests, with lower-frequency liquidity updates. We show that across several pools, by updating their strategy to more closely match the Nash equilibrium of our game, LPs can improve their median daily returns by \$116, which corresponds to an increase of 0.009\% in median daily return on investment.

总结:
随着分布式能源资源（DERs）的增长，电力网格面临边缘区域净负荷波动性增加的问题，影响了运行可靠性和稳定性。交易性能源通过本地能源市场提供了一种分散式的、间接的需求响应解决方案，而深度强化学习（DRL）等模型无关控制技术则使自动化、分散化的参与成为可能。然而，现有研究大多忽视了社区层面的净负荷变异性问题，更关注经济社会指标。本文针对这一空白，利用DRL代理自动参与名为ALEX的本地能源市场，各代理独立行动以最小化各自能源费用。结果表明，降低电费与减少净负荷变异性之间存在紧密联系，通过评估不同时间范围内的指标如爬坡率、负载因子和峰值需求得到证实。将DRL代理与近乎最优的动态规划方法进行基准对比，动态规划方法分别实现了每日进口、出口和峰值需求降低22.05%、83.92%和24.09%，而DRL代理表现出可比或更优的结果，分别降低了21.93%、84.46%和27.02%。该研究表明，DRL在分散化电网管理中的有效性，突显了其在社区驱动的能源市场中实现接近最优性能、减少净负荷变异性方面的可扩展性。 <div>

Abstract: As distributed energy resources (DERs) grow, the electricity grid faces increased net load variability at the grid edge, impacting operability and reliability. Transactive energy, facilitated through local energy markets, offers a decentralized, indirect demand response solution, with model-free control techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), enabling automated, decentralized participation. However, existing studies largely overlook community-level net load variability, focusing instead on socioeconomic metrics.
  This study addresses this gap by using DRL agents to automate end-user participation in a local energy market (ALEX), where agents act independently to minimize individual energy bills. Results reveal a strong link between bill reduction and decreased net load variability, assessed across metrics such as ramping rate, load factor, and peak demand over various time horizons. Using a no-control baseline, DRL agents are benchmarked against a near-optimal dynamic programming approach. The dynamic programming benchmark achieves reductions of 22.05 percent, 83.92 percent, and 24.09 percent in daily import, export, and peak demand, respectively, while the DRL agents show comparable or superior results with reductions of 21.93 percent, 84.46 percent, and 27.02 percent.
  This study demonstrates the effectiveness of DRL in decentralized grid management, highlighting its scalability and near-optimal performance in reducing net load variability within community-driven energy markets.

Abstract: Designing automated market makers (AMMs) for prediction markets on combinatorial securities over large outcome spaces poses significant computational challenges. Prior research has primarily focused on combinatorial prediction markets within specific set systems (e.g., intervals, permutations). We introduce a framework for designing AMMs on arbitrary set systems by building a novel connection to the range query problem in computational geometry. This connection enables the analysis of computational complexity and the design of efficient AMMs.
  We first demonstrate the equivalence between price queries and trade updates under the popular combinatorial logarithmic market scoring rule market and the range query and range update problem. Building on this equivalence, we construct sublinear time algorithms when the VC dimension of the set system is bounded and show the non-existence of such algorithms for unbounded VC dimension cases. We then extend this approach to AMMs for combinatorial prediction markets with quadratic and power scoring rules. Finally, we show that the multi-resolution market design can be naturally integrated into the partition-tree scheme.
  Additionally, we introduce the combinatorial swap operation problem for automated market makers in decentralized finance and show that it can be efficiently reduced to range update problems.

By conducting and analyzing expert interviews, the study identifies application scenarios and highlights challenges in retrieving multimedia content from the metaverse. The results reveal existing application scenarios of MVRs and confirm the relevance of capturing time-series data from the graphical rendering process and related input-output devices, which are also highly relevant to user needs. Furthermore, the study provides a foundation for developing retrieval systems tailored to MVRs by defining use cases, user stereotypes, and specific requirements for MVR Retrieval systems. The findings contribute to a better understanding of information search behaviors in MVR Retrieval and pave the way for future research and system design in this field.

Abstract: Smart contracts are software programs that enable diverse business activities on the blockchain. Recent research has identified new classes of "machine un-auditable" bugs that arise from both transactional contexts and source code. Existing detection methods require human understanding of underlying transaction logic and manual reasoning across different sources of context (i.e. modalities), such as code, dynamic transaction executions, and natural language specifying the expected transaction behavior.
  To automate the detection of ``machine un-auditable'' bugs, we present SmartInv, an accurate and fast smart contract invariant inference framework. Our key insight is that the expected behavior of smart contracts, as specified by invariants, relies on understanding and reasoning across multimodal information, such as source code and natural language. We propose a new prompting strategy to foundation models, Tier of Thought (ToT), to reason across multiple modalities of smart contracts and ultimately to generate invariants. By checking the violation of these generated invariants, SmartInv can identify potential vulnerabilities.
  We evaluate SmartInv on real-world contracts and re-discover bugs that resulted in multi-million dollar losses over the past 2.5 years (from January 1, 2021 to May 31, 2023). Our extensive evaluation shows that SmartInv generates (3.5X) more bug-critical invariants and detects (4$\times$) more critical bugs compared to the state-of-the-art tools in significantly (150X) less time. \sys uncovers 119 zero-day vulnerabilities from the 89,621 real-world contracts. Among them, five are critical zero-day bugs confirmed by developers as ``high severity.''

Abstract: The growing complexity of Internet of Things (IoT) environments, particularly in cross-domain data sharing, presents significant security challenges. Existing data-sharing schemes often rely on computationally expensive cryptographic operations and centralized key management, limiting their effectiveness for resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose an efficient, secure blockchain-based data-sharing scheme. First, our scheme adopts a distributed key generation method, which avoids single point of failure. This method also allows independent pseudonym generation and key updates, enhancing authentication flexibility while reducing computational overhead. Additionally, the scheme provides a complete data-sharing process, covering data uploading, storage, and sharing, while ensuring data traceability, integrity, and privacy. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is theoretically secure and resistant to various attacks, while performance evaluations demonstrate lower computational and communication overhead compared to existing solutions, making it both secure and efficient for IoT applications.

本文研究了一种基于原型的去中心化联邦学习系统的设计，旨在提高通信效率。针对原型冗余问题，文章提出了双重数据压缩技术：仅当原型具有信息论上的有用性（通过Jensen-Shannon距离判断）时发送更新消息，并利用聚类对原型进行压缩以减小 gossip 协议中的更新消息大小。此外，文中采用了并行而非序列化的 gossip 通信，并分析了其年龄信息（AoI）。实验结果显示，通过这些改进，可以在不降低学习算法收敛速度的前提下显著减少通信负载。 <div>

Abstract: In prototype-based federated learning, the exchange of model parameters between clients and the master server is replaced by transmission of prototypes or quantized versions of the data samples to the aggregation server. A fully decentralized deployment of prototype- based learning, without a central agregartor of prototypes, is more robust upon network failures and reacts faster to changes in the statistical distribution of the data, suggesting potential advantages and quick adaptation in dynamic learning tasks, e.g., when the data sources are IoT devices or when data is non-iid. In this paper, we consider the problem of designing a communication-efficient decentralized learning system based on prototypes. We address the challenge of prototype redundancy by leveraging on a twofold data compression technique, i.e., sending only update messages if the prototypes are informationtheoretically useful (via the Jensen-Shannon distance), and using clustering on the prototypes to compress the update messages used in the gossip protocol. We also use parallel instead of sequential gossiping, and present an analysis of its age-of-information (AoI). Our experimental results show that, with these improvements, the communications load can be substantially reduced without decreasing the convergence rate of the learning algorithm.

Abstract: An effective method for suppressing intentional forks in a blockchain is the last-generated rule, which selects the most recent chain as the main chain in the event of a chain tie. This rule helps invalidate blocks that are withheld by adversaries for a certain period. However, existing last-generated rules face an issue in that their applications to the system are not fully localized. In conservative cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin, it is desirable for methods to be applied in a fully local manner. In this paper, we propose a locally applicable last-generated rule. Our method is straightforward and is based on a relative time reference. By conservatively setting the upper bound for the clock skews $\Delta_{O_i}$ to 200 s, our proposed method reduces the proportion $\gamma$ of honest miners following the attacker during chain ties by more than 40% compared to existing local methods.

Abstract: The evolution of wireless communication systems will be fundamentally impacted by an open radio access network (O-RAN), a new concept defining an intelligent architecture with enhanced flexibility, openness, and the ability to slice services more efficiently. For all its promises, and like any technological advancement, O-RAN is not without risks that need to be carefully assessed and properly addressed to accelerate its wide adoption in future mobile networks. In this paper, we present an in-depth security analysis of the O-RAN architecture, discussing the potential threats that may arise in the different O-RAN architecture layers and their impact on the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad. We also promote the potential of zero trust, Moving Target Defense (MTD), blockchain, and large language models(LLM) technologies in fortifying O-RAN's security posture. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of MTD in empowering robust deep reinforcement learning methods for dynamic network slice admission control in the O-RAN architecture. Moreover, we examine the effect of explainable AI (XAI) based on LLMs in securing the system.

Abstract: News recommender systems are hindered by the brief lifespan of articles, as they undergo rapid relevance decay. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of content-based neural techniques in tackling this problem. However, these models often involve complex neural architectures and often lack consideration for negative examples. In this study, we posit that the careful sampling of negative examples has a big impact on the model's outcome. We devise a negative sampling technique that not only improves the accuracy of the model but also facilitates the decentralization of the recommendation system. The experimental results obtained using the MIND dataset demonstrate that the accuracy of the method under consideration can compete with that of State-of-the-Art models. The utilization of the sampling technique is essential in reducing model complexity and accelerating the training process, while maintaining a high level of accuracy. Finally, we discuss how decentralized models can help improve privacy and scalability.

总结:
本文研究了多智能体光滑在线凸优化（SOCO）问题，其中$N$个智能体通过通信图进行交互。每个轮次中，每个智能体$i$会以在线方式接收到强凸击打成本函数$f^i_t$并选择动作$x^i_t\in\mathbb{R}^d$。目标是最小化全局累积成本，包括个体击打成本之和、决策变化的“切换成本”以及相邻智能体决策偏离的“不相似性成本”。文章首次提出了一个多智能体SOOC的分布式算法并证明其渐近最优性。该算法允许每个智能体仅利用与其直接邻接节点的信息进行操作。对于有限时间性能，文章证明了竞争比的优值差随时间序列$T$减小，并可以根据每个智能体每轮可利用的计算资源进行便捷调整。此外，即使通信图可以随时间任意和自适应地改变，该方法仍然有效。最后，文章表明每轮的计算复杂度仅与智能体数量对数相关且几乎线性依赖于它们在图中的度数，确保了大系统实施的可扩展性。<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: We study the multi-agent Smoothed Online Convex Optimization (SOCO) problem, where $N$ agents interact through a communication graph. In each round, each agent $i$ receives a strongly convex hitting cost function $f^i_t$ in an online fashion and selects an action $x^i_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$. The objective is to minimize the global cumulative cost, which includes the sum of individual hitting costs $f^i_t(x^i_t)$, a temporal "switching cost" for changing decisions, and a spatial "dissimilarity cost" that penalizes deviations in decisions among neighboring agents. We propose the first decentralized algorithm for multi-agent SOCO and prove its asymptotic optimality. Our approach allows each agent to operate using only local information from its immediate neighbors in the graph. For finite-time performance, we establish that the optimality gap in competitive ratio decreases with the time horizon $T$ and can be conveniently tuned based on the per-round computation available to each agent. Moreover, our results hold even when the communication graph changes arbitrarily and adaptively over time. Finally, we establish that the computational complexity per round depends only logarithmically on the number of agents and almost linearly on their degree within the graph, ensuring scalability for large-system implementations.

Abstract: In decentralized systems, it is often necessary to select an 'active' subset of participants from the total participant pool, with the goal of satisfying computational limitations or optimizing resource efficiency. This selection can sometimes be made at random, mirroring the sortition practice invented in classical antiquity aimed at achieving a high degree of statistical representativeness. However, the recent emergence of specialized decentralized networks that solve concrete coordination problems and are characterized by measurable success metrics often requires prioritizing performance optimization over representativeness. We introduce a simple algorithm for 'merit-based sortition', in which the quality of each participant influences its probability of being drafted into the active set, while simultaneously retaining representativeness by allowing inactive participants an infinite number of chances to be drafted into the active set with non-zero probability. Using a suite of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm boosts the quality metric describing the performance of the active set by $>2$ times the intrinsic stochasticity. This implies that merit-based sortition ensures a statistically significant performance boost to the drafted, 'active' set, while retaining the property of classical, random sortition that it enables upward mobility from a much larger 'inactive' set. This way, merit-based sortition fulfils a key requirement for decentralized systems in need of performance optimization.

Abstract: This paper presents a scheduling algorithm that divides a manufacturing/warehouse floor into zones that an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) will occupy and complete part pick-up and drop-off tasks. Each zone is balanced so that each AMR will share each task equally. These zones change over time to accommodate fluctuations in production and to avoid overloading an AMR with tasks. A decentralized dynamic zoning (DDZ) algorithm is introduced to find the optimal zone design, eliminating the possibility of single-point failure from a centralized unit. Then a simulation is built comparing the adaptability of DDZ and other dynamic zoning algorithms from previous works. Initial results show that DDZ has a much lower throughput than other dynamic zoning algorithms but DDZ can achieve a better distribution of tasks. Initial results show that DDZ had a lower standard deviation of AMR total travel distance which was 2874.7 feet less than previous works. This 68.7\% decrease in standard deviation suggests that AMRs under DDZ travel a similar distance during production. This could be useful for real-world applications by making it easier to design charging and maintenance schedules without much downtime.

<br /><br />总结:
本文提出了一个新的Federated Learning框架——ClipFL，该框架针对边缘设备训练中存在的噪声标签问题。现有FL方法在处理高噪声水平的数据集时表现有限，而ClipFL通过引入噪声候选分数（NCS）来识别并排除具有噪声数据的客户端。它分为三个阶段：预客户端修剪以识别潜在噪声客户端并计算其NCS，客户端修剪则根据NCS排除一定比例的噪声客户端，以及后客户端修剪阶段，使用标准FL对干净客户端进行全局模型的微调。实验表明，ClipFL在各种数据集和噪声水平下都表现出准确的噪声客户端识别能力、更优的性能、更快的收敛速度以及更低的通信成本，相较于当前最先进的FL方法有显著优势。相关代码已在https://github.com/MMorafah/ClipFL上开源。 <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, existing FL methods often assume clean annotated datasets, impractical for resource-constrained edge devices. In reality, noisy labels are prevalent, posing significant challenges to FL performance. Prior approaches attempt label correction and robust training techniques but exhibit limited efficacy, particularly under high noise levels. This paper introduces ClipFL (Federated Learning Client Pruning), a novel framework addressing noisy labels from a fresh perspective. ClipFL identifies and excludes noisy clients based on their performance on a clean validation dataset, tracked using a Noise Candidacy Score (NCS). The framework comprises three phases: pre-client pruning to identify potential noisy clients and calculate their NCS, client pruning to exclude a percentage of clients with the highest NCS, and post-client pruning for fine-tuning the global model with standard FL on clean clients. Empirical evaluation demonstrates ClipFL's efficacy across diverse datasets and noise levels, achieving accurate noisy client identification, superior performance, faster convergence, and reduced communication costs compared to state-of-the-art FL methods.

Abstract: The rise of delay-sensitive yet computing-intensive Internet of Things (IoT) applications poses challenges due to the limited processing power of IoT devices. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers a promising solution to address these challenges by placing computing servers close to end users. Despite extensive research on MEC, optimizing network topology to improve computational efficiency remains underexplored. Recognizing the critical role of network topology, we introduce a novel decentralized network topology design strategy for task offloading (DNTD-TO) that jointly considers topology design and task allocation. Inspired by communication and sensor networks, DNTD-TO efficiently constructs three-layered network structures for task offloading and generates optimal task allocations for these structures. Comparisons with existing topology design methods demonstrate the promising performance of our approach.

Abstract: Smart contracts, self-executing agreements directly encoded in code, are fundamental to blockchain technology, especially in decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3. However, the rise of Ponzi schemes in smart contracts poses significant risks, leading to substantial financial losses and eroding trust in blockchain systems. Existing detection methods, such as PonziGuard, depend on large amounts of labeled data and struggle to identify unseen Ponzi schemes, limiting their reliability and generalizability. In contrast, we introduce PonziSleuth, the first LLM-driven approach for detecting Ponzi smart contracts, which requires no labeled training data. PonziSleuth utilizes advanced language understanding capabilities of LLMs to analyze smart contract source code through a novel two-step zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting technique. Our extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets and real-world contracts demonstrates that PonziSleuth delivers comparable, and often superior, performance without the extensive data requirements, achieving a balanced detection accuracy of 96.06% with GPT-3.5-turbo, 93.91% with LLAMA3, and 94.27% with Mistral. In real-world detection, PonziSleuth successfully identified 15 new Ponzi schemes from 4,597 contracts verified by Etherscan in March 2024, with a false negative rate of 0% and a false positive rate of 0.29%. These results highlight PonziSleuth's capability to detect diverse and novel Ponzi schemes, marking a significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for enhancing blockchain security and mitigating financial scams.

Abstract: Distributed ledgers are common in the industry. Some of them can use blockchains as their underlying infrastructure. A blockchain requires participants to agree on its contents. This can be achieved via a consensus protocol, and several BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant) protocols have been proposed for this purpose. How do these protocols differ in performance? And how is this difference affected by the communication network? Moreover, such a protocol would need a timer to ensure progress, but how should the timer be set?
  This paper presents an analytical model to address these and related issues in the case of crash faults. Specifically, it focuses on two consensus protocols (Istanbul BFT and HotStuff) and two network topologies (Folded-Clos and Dragonfly). The model provides closed-form expressions for analyzing how the timer value and number of participants, faults and switches affect the consensus time. The formulas and analyses are validated with simulations. The conclusion offers some tips for analytical modeling of such protocols.

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have seen significant growth and functional enhancement in recent years, which integrates various capabilities like communication, navigation, and remote sensing. However, the heterogeneity of data collected by different satellites and the problems of efficient inter-satellite collaborative computation pose significant obstacles to realizing the potential of these constellations. Existing approaches struggle with data heterogeneity, varing image resolutions, and the need for efficient on-orbit model training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel decentralized PFL framework, namely, A Novel Decentra L ized Person A lized Federated Learning for Heteroge N eous LEO Satell I te Co N st E llation (ALANINE). ALANINE incorporates decentralized FL (DFL) for satellite image Super Resolution (SR), which enhances input data quality. Then it utilizes PFL to implement a personalized approach that accounts for unique characteristics of satellite data. In addition, the framework employs advanced model pruning to optimize model complexity and transmission efficiency. The framework enables efficient data acquisition and processing while improving the accuracy of PFL image processing models. Simulation results demonstrate that ALANINE exhibits superior performance in on-orbit training of SR and PFL image processing models compared to traditional centralized approaches. This novel method shows significant improvements in data acquisition efficiency, process accuracy, and model adaptability to local satellite conditions.

Abstract: Blockchain technology is apt to facilitate the automation of multi-party cooperations among various players in a decentralized setting, especially in cases where trust among participants is limited. Transactions are stored in a ledger, a replica of which is retained by every node of the blockchain network. The operations saved thereby are thus publicly accessible. While this aspect enhances transparency, reliability, and persistence, it hinders the utilization of public blockchains for process automation as it violates typical confidentiality requirements in corporate settings. To overcome this issue, we propose our approach named Multi-Authority Approach to Transaction Systems for Interoperating Applications (MARTSIA). Based on Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption (MA-ABE), MARTSIA enables read-access control over shared data at the level of message parts. User-defined policies determine whether an actor can interpret the publicly stored information or not, depending on the actor's attributes declared by a consortium of certifiers. Still, all nodes in the blockchain network can attest to the publication of the (encrypted) data. We provide a formal analysis of the security guarantees of MARTSIA, and illustrate the proof-of-concept implementation over multiple blockchain platforms. To demonstrate its interoperability, we showcase its usage in ensemble with a state-of-the-art blockchain-based engine for multi-party process execution, and three real-world decentralized applications in the context of NFT markets, supply chain, and retail.

总结:
本文提出了一种基于交替方向乘子方法(ADMM)的新型在线多任务学习(OMTL)框架，旨在解决现有梯度下降法在OMTL中可能遇到的梯度消失和条件恶化问题，并适应在线并行优化的需求。该框架动态建模多个任务之间的关系，以适应不断变化的在线环境。在具有中央服务器的经典分布式计算架构下，利用ADMM优化器的OMTL算法在准确性和效率上优于基于SGD的方法。为进一步应对大数据场景下的中央服务器瓶颈问题，文章还针对去中心化设置调整了算法，使得每个节点仅需与其局部邻居交换信息即可工作。实验证实在合成数据集及几个真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明了所提方法的有效性。 <div>

Abstract: Online multi-task learning (OMTL) enhances streaming data processing by leveraging the inherent relations among multiple tasks. It can be described as an optimization problem in which a single loss function is defined for multiple tasks. Existing gradient-descent-based methods for this problem might suffer from gradient vanishing and poor conditioning issues. Furthermore, the centralized setting hinders their application to online parallel optimization, which is vital to big data analytics. Therefore, this study proposes a novel OMTL framework based on the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM), a recent breakthrough in optimization suitable for the distributed computing environment because of its decomposable and easy-to-implement nature. The relations among multiple tasks are modeled dynamically to fit the constant changes in an online scenario. In a classical distributed computing architecture with a central server, the proposed OMTL algorithm with the ADMM optimizer outperforms SGD-based approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Because the central server might become a bottleneck when the data scale grows, we further tailor the algorithm to a decentralized setting, so that each node can work by only exchanging information with local neighbors. Experimental results on a synthetic and several real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our methods.

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks are increasingly essential for space-based artificial intelligence (AI) applications. However, as commercial use expands, LEO satellite networks face heightened cyberattack risks, especially through satellite-to-satellite communication links, which are more vulnerable than ground-based connections. As the number of operational satellites continues to grow, addressing these security challenges becomes increasingly critical. Traditional approaches, which focus on sending models to ground stations for validation, often overlook the limited communication windows available to LEO satellites, leaving critical security risks unaddressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose a sharded blockchain-based federated learning framework for LEO networks, called SBFL-LEO. This framework improves the reliability of inter-satellite communications using blockchain technology and assigns specific roles to each satellite. Miner satellites leverage cosine similarity (CS) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to identify malicious models and monitor each other to detect inaccurate aggregated models. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods in both model accuracy and energy efficiency, significantly enhancing system robustness against attacks.

Abstract: Mining attacks enable an adversary to procure a disproportionately large portion of mining rewards by deviating from honest mining practices within the PoW-based blockchain system. In this paper, we demonstrate that the security vulnerabilities of PoW-based blockchain extend beyond what these mining attacks initially reveal. We introduce a novel mining strategy, named BM-PAW, which yields superior rewards for both the attacker and the targeted pool compared to the state-of-the-art mining attack: PAW. Our analysis reveals that BM-PAW attackers are incentivized to offer appropriate bribe money to other targets, as they comply with the attacker's directives upon receiving payment. We find the BM-PAW attacker can circumvent the "miner's dilemma" through equilibrium analysis in a two-pool BM-PAW game scenario, wherein the outcome is determined by the attacker's mining power. We finally propose practical countermeasures to mitigate these novel pool attacks.

<div> 关键词: 区块链、智能合约、安全挑战、LLM、Smart-LLaMA

总结:
随着区块链技术的迅速发展，智能合约安全性成为一个重大挑战。现有智能合约漏洞检测方法面临三大问题：数据集质量不足，缺乏详细解释和精确漏洞位置信息；大型语言模型（LLMs）对智能合约领域的适应性有限，因为大多数LLMs仅在通用文本数据上预训练而缺少智能合约特定的数据；对于检测到的漏洞缺乏高质量的解释，现有方法只关注检测而非清晰解释。为解决这些问题，文章提出了基于LLaMA语言模型的高级检测方法Smart-LLaMA。首先，构建了一个涵盖四种漏洞类型的全面数据集，其中包含标签、详细解释及精确漏洞位置信息。其次，引入了针对智能合约的专业持续预训练，使用原始智能合约数据使LLM能够学习智能合约的语法和语义，提升其领域适应性。此外，还提出了解释引导的微调方法，通过成对的脆弱代码及其解释对LLM进行微调，实现既检测漏洞又给出有理有据的解释。实验结果显示，Smart-LLaMA在性能上优于当前最优基线，F1分数和准确率平均分别提高了6.49%和3.78%，同时提供了可靠的解释。 <div>

Abstract: With the rapid development of blockchain technology, smart contract security has become a critical challenge. Existing smart contract vulnerability detection methods face three main issues: (1) Insufficient quality of datasets, lacking detailed explanations and precise vulnerability locations. (2) Limited adaptability of large language models (LLMs) to the smart contract domain, as most LLMs are pre-trained on general text data but minimal smart contract-specific data. (3) Lack of high-quality explanations for detected vulnerabilities, as existing methods focus solely on detection without clear explanations. These limitations hinder detection performance and make it harder for developers to understand and fix vulnerabilities quickly, potentially leading to severe financial losses. To address these problems, we propose Smart-LLaMA, an advanced detection method based on the LLaMA language model. First, we construct a comprehensive dataset covering four vulnerability types with labels, detailed explanations, and precise vulnerability locations. Second, we introduce Smart Contract-Specific Continual Pre-Training, using raw smart contract data to enable the LLM to learn smart contract syntax and semantics, enhancing their domain adaptability. Furthermore, we propose Explanation-Guided Fine-Tuning, which fine-tunes the LLM using paired vulnerable code and explanations, enabling both vulnerability detection and reasoned explanations. We evaluate explanation quality through LLM and human evaluation, focusing on Correctness, Completeness, and Conciseness. Experimental results show that Smart-LLaMA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with average improvements of 6.49% in F1 score and 3.78% in accuracy, while providing reliable explanations.

Abstract: Mobile devices, including smartphones and laptops, generate decentralized and heterogeneous data, presenting significant challenges for traditional centralized machine learning models due to substantial communication costs and privacy risks. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising alternative by enabling collaborative training of a global model across decentralized devices without data sharing. However, FL faces challenges due to statistical heterogeneity among clients, where non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data impedes model convergence and performance. This paper focuses on data-dependent heterogeneity in FL and proposes a novel approach leveraging mean latent representations extracted from locally trained models. The proposed method normalizes client contributions based on these representations, allowing the central server to estimate and adjust for heterogeneity during aggregation. This normalization enhances the global model's generalization and mitigates the limitations of conventional federated averaging methods. The main contributions include introducing a normalization scheme using mean latent representations to handle statistical heterogeneity in FL, demonstrating the seamless integration with existing FL algorithms to improve performance in non-IID settings, and validating the approach through extensive experiments on diverse datasets. Results show significant improvements in model accuracy and consistency across skewed distributions. Our experiments with six FL schemes: FedAvg, FedProx, FedBABU, FedNova, SCAFFOLD, and SGDM highlight the robustness of our approach. This research advances FL by providing a practical and computationally efficient solution for statistical heterogeneity, contributing to the development of more reliable and generalized machine learning models.

Abstract: Regulating the voltage of the common DC bus, also referred to as the load bus, in DC microgrids is crucial for ensuring reliability and maintaining the nominal load voltage, which is essential for protecting sensitive loads from voltage variations. Stability and reliability are thereby enhanced, preventing malfunctions and extending the lifespan of sensitive loads (e.g., electronic devices). Voltage drops are caused by resistances of feeders connecting converters to the common DC bus, resulting in a reduced DC bus voltage compared to the nominal/desired value. Existing techniques to restore this voltage in DC microgrids are mainly centralized and rely on secondary control layers. These layers sense the common DC bus voltage, compare it to the nominal value, and utilize a PI controller to send corrections via communication links to each converter. In this paper, a local and straightforward approach to restoring the bus voltage in DC microgrids is presented, ensuring regulation in a decentralized manner. Voltage drops across resistances of feeders are compensated by an additional control loop feedback within each converter, based on the converter output current and feeder resistance. The proposed approach is verified through simulation and hardware-in-the-loop results, eliminating the need for communication links and hence increasing reliability and reducing cybersecurity threats.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has become a cornerstone in decentralized learning, where, in many scenarios, the incoming data distribution will change dynamically over time, introducing continuous learning (CL) problems. This continual federated learning (CFL) task presents unique challenges, particularly regarding catastrophic forgetting and non-IID input data. Existing solutions include using a replay buffer to store historical data or leveraging generative adversarial networks. Nevertheless, motivated by recent advancements in the diffusion model for generative tasks, this paper introduces DCFL, a novel framework tailored to address the challenges of CFL in dynamic distributed learning environments. Our approach harnesses the power of the conditional diffusion model to generate synthetic historical data at each local device during communication, effectively mitigating latent shifts in dynamic data distribution inputs. We provide the convergence bound for the proposed CFL framework and demonstrate its promising performance across multiple datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in tackling the complexities of CFL tasks.

Abstract: Blockchain sharding has emerged as a promising solution to the scalability challenges in traditional blockchain systems by partitioning the network into smaller, manageable subsets called shards. Despite its potential, existing sharding solutions face significant limitations in handling dynamic workloads, ensuring secure cross-shard transactions, and maintaining system integrity. To address these gaps, we propose DynaShard, a dynamic and secure cross-shard transaction processing mechanism designed to enhance blockchain sharding efficiency and security. DynaShard combines adaptive shard management, a hybrid consensus approach, plus an efficient state synchronization and dispute resolution protocol. Our performance evaluation, conducted using a robust experimental setup with real-world network conditions and transaction workloads, demonstrates DynaShard's superior throughput, reduced latency, and improved shard utilization compared to the FTBS method. Specifically, DynaShard achieves up to a 42.6% reduction in latency and a 78.77% improvement in shard utilization under high transaction volumes and varying cross-shard transaction ratios.

Abstract: Recently, quadrupedal locomotion has achieved significant success, but their manipulation capabilities, particularly in handling large objects, remain limited, restricting their usefulness in demanding real-world applications such as search and rescue, construction, industrial automation, and room organization. This paper tackles the task of obstacle-aware, long-horizon pushing by multiple quadrupedal robots. We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with three levels of control. The high-level controller integrates an RRT planner and a centralized adaptive policy to generate subgoals, while the mid-level controller uses a decentralized goal-conditioned policy to guide the robots toward these sub-goals. A pre-trained low-level locomotion policy executes the movement commands. We evaluate our method against several baselines in simulation, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches, with 36.0% higher success rates and 24.5% reduction in completion time than the best baseline. Our framework successfully enables long-horizon, obstacle-aware manipulation tasks like Push-Cuboid and Push-T on Go1 robots in the real world.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of Multi-Agent Systems in eliciting cross-agent communication and enhancing collective intelligence through group decision-making in a decentralized setting. Unlike centralized mechanisms, where a fixed hierarchy governs social choice, decentralized group decision-making allows agents to engage in joint deliberation. Our research focuses on the dynamics of communication and decision-making within various social choice methods. By applying different voting rules in various environments, we find that moderate decision flexibility yields better outcomes. Additionally, exploring the linguistic features of agent-to-agent conversations reveals indicators of effective collaboration, offering insights into communication patterns that facilitate or hinder collaboration. Finally, we propose various methods for determining the optimal stopping point in multi-agent collaborations based on linguistic cues. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how decentralized decision-making and group conversation shape multi-agent collaboration, with implications for the design of more effective MAS environments.

Abstract: Multifractality is a concept that helps compactly grasping the most essential features of the financial dynamics. In its fully developed form, this concept applies to essentially all mature financial markets and even to more liquid cryptocurrencies traded on the centralized exchanges. A new element that adds complexity to cryptocurrency markets is the possibility of decentralized trading. Based on the extracted tick-by-tick transaction data from the Universal Router contract of the Uniswap decentralized exchange, from June 6, 2023, to June 30, 2024, the present study using Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) shows that even though liquidity on these new exchanges is still much lower compared to centralized exchanges convincing traces of multifractality are already emerging on this new trading as well. The resulting multifractal spectra are however strongly left-side asymmetric which indicates that this multifractality comes primarily from large fluctuations and small ones are more of the uncorrelated noise type. What is particularly interesting here is the fact that multifractality is more developed for time series representing transaction volumes than rates of return. On the level of these larger events a trace of multifractal cross-correlations between the two characteristics is also observed.

Abstract: This paper investigates the semantic communication and cooperative tracking control for an UAV swarm comprising a leader UAV and a group of follower UAVs, all interconnected via unreliable wireless multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels. Initially, we develop a dynamic model for the UAV swarm that accounts for both the internal interactions among the cooperative follower UAVs and the imperfections inherent in the MIMO channels that interlink the leader and follower UAVs. Building on this model, we incorporate the power costs of the UAVs and formulate the communication and cooperative tracking control challenge as a drift-plus-penalty optimization problem. We then derive a closed-form optimal solution that maintains a decentralized semantic architecture, dynamically adjusting to the tracking error costs and local channel conditions within the swarm. Employing Lyapunov drift analysis, we establish closed-form sufficient conditions for the stabilization of the UAV swarm's tracking performance. Numerical results demonstrate the significant enhancements in our proposed scheme over various state-of-the-art methods.

总结:
本文提出了一个新的研究问题——联邦图压缩，针对大规模分布式图数据场景，旨在在保护数据持有者隐私的同时，进行有效的图压缩。为解决此问题，文章提出了一种联邦图压缩框架，该框架将传统的图压缩中的梯度匹配过程分解为客户端的梯度计算和服务器端的梯度匹配，有效减轻了客户端的计算负担。然而，实验表明在联邦学习环境下，压缩过程中会持续泄露数据成员身份隐私，对此，文中创新性地引入信息瓶颈原理，在局部预训练阶段仅提取部分节点特征并在联邦训练中使用，从而有效防止会员信息泄露。实验证明，所提出的联邦图压缩框架不仅在训练过程中能较好地保护成员隐私，而且其性能与现有集中式图压缩和联邦图学习方法相比也表现出可比甚至更优的效果。 <div>

Abstract: Graph condensation, which reduces the size of a large-scale graph by synthesizing a small-scale condensed graph as its substitution, has immediately benefited various graph learning tasks. However, existing graph condensation methods rely on centralized data storage, which is unfeasible for real-world decentralized data distribution, and overlook data holders' privacy-preserving requirements. To bridge the gap, we propose and study the novel problem of federated graph condensation for graph neural networks (GNNs). Specifically, we first propose a general framework for federated graph condensation, in which we decouple the typical gradient matching process for graph condensation into client-side gradient calculation and server-side gradient matching. In this way, the burdensome computation cost in client-side is largely alleviated. Besides, our empirical studies show that under the federated setting, the condensed graph will consistently leak data membership privacy, i.e., the condensed graph during the federated training can be utilized to steal the training data under the membership inference attacks (MIA). To tackle this issue, we innovatively incorporate information bottleneck principles into the federated graph condensation, which only needs to extract partial node features in one local pre-training step and utilize the features during federated training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework can consistently protect membership privacy during training. Meanwhile, it also achieves comparable and even superior performance against existing centralized graph condensation and federated graph learning methods.

Abstract: Industry 4.0 and beyond will rely heavily on sustainable Business Decision Modelling (BDM) that can be accelerated by blockchain and Digital Twin (DT) solutions. BDM is built on models and frameworks refined by key identification factors, data analysis, and mathematical or computational aspects applicable to complex business scenarios. Gaining actionable intelligence from collected data for BDM requires a carefully considered infrastructure to ensure data transparency, security, accessibility and sustainability. Organisations should consider social, economic and environmental factors (based on the triple bottom line approach) to ensure sustainability when integrating such an infrastructure. These sustainability features directly impact BDM concerning resource optimisation, stakeholder engagement, regulatory compliance and environmental impacts. To further understand these segments, taxonomies are defined to evaluate blockchain and DT sustainability features based on an in-depth review of the current state-of-the-art research. Detailed comparative evaluations provide insight into the reachability of the sustainable solution in terms of ideologies, access control and performance overheads. Several research questions are put forward to motivate further research that significantly impacts BDM. Finally, a case study based on an exemplary supply chain management system is presented to show the interoperability of blockchain and DT with BDM.

Abstract: Motivated by understanding and analysis of large-scale machine learning under heavy-tailed gradient noise, we study decentralized optimization with gradient clipping, i.e., in which certain clipping operators are applied to the gradients or gradient estimates computed from local nodes prior to further processing. While vanilla gradient clipping has proven effective in mitigating the impact of heavy-tailed gradient noise in non-distributed setups, it incurs bias that causes convergence issues in heterogeneous distributed settings. To address the inherent bias introduced by gradient clipping, we develop a smoothed clipping operator, and propose a decentralized gradient method equipped with an error feedback mechanism, i.e., the clipping operator is applied on the difference between some local gradient estimator and local stochastic gradient. We consider strongly convex and smooth local functions under symmetric heavy-tailed gradient noise that may not have finite moments of order greater than one. We show that the proposed decentralized gradient clipping method achieves a mean-square error (MSE) convergence rate of $O(1/t^\delta)$, $\delta \in (0, 2/5)$, where the exponent $\delta$ is independent of the existence of higher order gradient noise moments $\alpha > 1$ and lower bounded by some constant dependent on condition number. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MSE convergence result for decentralized gradient clipping under heavy-tailed noise without assuming bounded gradient. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Advancements in genomics technology lead to a rising volume of viral (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) sequence data, resulting in increased usage of machine learning (ML) in bioinformatics. Traditional ML techniques require centralized data collection and processing, posing challenges in realistic healthcare scenarios. Additionally, privacy, ownership, and stringent regulation issues exist when pooling medical data into centralized storage to train a powerful deep learning (DL) model. The Federated learning (FL) approach overcomes such issues by setting up a central aggregator server and a shared global model. It also facilitates data privacy by extracting knowledge while keeping the actual data private. This work proposes a cutting-edge Privacy enhancement through Iterative Collaboration (EPIC) architecture. The network is divided and distributed between local and centralized servers. We demonstrate the EPIC approach to resolve a supervised classification problem to estimate SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence data lineage without explicitly transferring raw sequence data. We aim to create a universal decentralized optimization framework that allows various data holders to work together and converge to a single predictive model. The findings demonstrate that privacy-preserving strategies can be successfully used with aggregation approaches without materially altering the degree of learning convergence. Finally, we highlight a few potential issues and prospects for study in FL-based approaches to healthcare applications.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning technique that maintains data privacy by providing a decentralized training method for machine learning models using distributed big data. This promising Federated Learning approach has also gained popularity in bioinformatics, where the privacy of biomedical data holds immense importance, especially when patient data is involved. Despite the successful implementation of Federated learning in biological sequence analysis, rigorous consideration is still required to improve accuracy in a way that data privacy should not be compromised. Additionally, the optimal integration of federated learning, especially in protein sequence analysis, has not been fully explored. We propose a deep feed-forward neural network-based enhanced federated learning method for protein sequence classification to overcome these challenges. Our method introduces novel enhancements to improve classification accuracy. We introduce dynamic weighted federated learning (DWFL) which is a federated learning-based approach, where local model weights are adjusted using weighted averaging based on their performance metrics. By assigning higher weights to well-performing models, we aim to create a more potent initial global model for the federated learning process, leading to improved accuracy. We conduct experiments using real-world protein sequence datasets to assess the effectiveness of DWFL. The results obtained using our proposed approach demonstrate significant improvements in model accuracy, making federated learning a preferred, more robust, and privacy-preserving approach for collaborative machine-learning tasks.

arXiv:2411.05260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning has emerged as a leading approach for decentralized machine learning, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exchanging private data. While FL enhances data privacy, it remains vulnerable to inference attacks, such as gradient inversion and membership inference, during both training and inference phases. Homomorphic Encryption provides a promising solution by encrypting model updates to protect against such attacks, but it introduces substantial communication overhead, slowing down training and increasing computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose QuanCrypt-FL, a novel algorithm that combines low-bit quantization and pruning techniques to enhance protection against attacks while significantly reducing computational costs during training. Further, we propose and implement mean-based clipping to mitigate quantization overflow or errors. By integrating these methods, QuanCrypt-FL creates a communication-efficient FL framework that ensures privacy protection with minimal impact on model accuracy, thereby improving both computational efficiency and attack resilience. We validate our approach on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. QuanCrypt-FL consistently outperforms existing method and matches Vanilla-FL in terms of accuracy across varying client. Further, QuanCrypt-FL achieves up to 9x faster encryption, 16x faster decryption, and 1.5x faster inference compared to BatchCrypt, with training time reduced by up to 3x.

Abstract: We present a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) approach to address the multi-agent shepherding control problem, departing from the conventional assumption of cohesive target groups. Our two-layer control architecture consists of a low-level controller that guides each herder to contain a specific target within a goal region, while a high-level layer dynamically selects from multiple targets the one an herder should aim at corralling and containing. Cooperation emerges naturally, as herders autonomously choose distinct targets to expedite task completion. We further extend this approach to large-scale systems, where each herder applies a shared policy, trained with few agents, while managing a fixed subset of agents.

<div> 关键词：网络期望最大化（Network EM）、高斯混合模型、分布式联邦学习、动量网络EM（MNEM）、半监督MNEM（semi-MNEM）

<br /><br />总结:
本文系统研究了应用于高斯混合模型的多种网络期望最大化（EM）算法，在分布式联邦学习的框架下。针对异质数据和成分分离不良的问题，文章提出了两种创新解决方案。首先，为处理异质数据，文章引入了动量网络EM（MNEM）算法，该算法使用动量参数结合当前与历史估计器的信息。其次，为应对成分分离不良的挑战，他们开发了半监督MNEM（semi-MNEM）算法，利用部分标注的数据。理论分析表明，即使在异质场景中，当混合组件满足一定的分离条件时，MNEM可以实现与全样本估计器相当的统计效率。此外，semi-MNEM算法能加快MNEM算法的收敛速度，有效解决了成分分离不良情况下的数值收敛难题。通过大量的模拟和真实数据分析验证了这些理论发现。 <div>

Abstract: We systematically study various network Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms for the Gaussian mixture model within the framework of decentralized federated learning. Our theoretical investigation reveals that directly extending the classical decentralized supervised learning method to the EM algorithm exhibits poor estimation accuracy with heterogeneous data across clients and struggles to converge numerically when Gaussian components are poorly-separated. To address these issues, we propose two novel solutions. First, to handle heterogeneous data, we introduce a momentum network EM (MNEM) algorithm, which uses a momentum parameter to combine information from both the current and historical estimators. Second, to tackle the challenge of poorly-separated Gaussian components, we develop a semi-supervised MNEM (semi-MNEM) algorithm, which leverages partially labeled data. Rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that MNEM can achieve statistical efficiency comparable to that of the whole sample estimator when the mixture components satisfy certain separation conditions, even in heterogeneous scenarios. Moreover, the semi-MNEM estimator enhances the convergence speed of the MNEM algorithm, effectively addressing the numerical convergence challenges in poorly-separated scenarios. Extensive simulation and real data analyses are conducted to justify our theoretical findings.

Abstract: A key motivation in the development of distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) is to widen the computational bottleneck of centralized MPC for large-scale systems. Parallelizing computations among individual subsystems, distributed MPC has the prospect of scaling well for large networks. However, the communication demand may deteriorate the performance of iterative decentralized optimization, if excessively many optimizer iterations are required per control step. Moreover, centralized solvers often exhibit faster asymptotic convergence rates and, by parallelizing costly linear algebra operations, they can also benefit from modern multi-core computing architectures. On this canvas, we study the computational performance of cooperative distributed MPC for linear and nonlinear systems. To this end, we apply a tailored decentralized real-time iteration scheme to frequency control for power systems. For the considered linear and nonlinear benchmarks, distributed MPC and distributed Nonlinear MPC (NMPC) scale well as the required number of iterations does not depend on the number of subsystems. Comparisons with multithreaded centralized solvers show competitive performance of the considered decentralized optimization algorithms.

<div> 关键词: 区块链、确认规则、比特币、以太坊、Gasper<br /><br />总结:
本文讨论了区块链中的确认规则，特别是以太坊网络中的确认机制。现有的以太坊共识协议中采用的是FFG最终化规则（Gasper），但在异步网络条件下确认交易速度较慢，最佳情况下也需要约13至19分钟。为此，文章提出了一个新的快速确认规则，该规则基于同步网络条件，能将交易的最好情况下的确认时间缩短到仅12秒，显著提高了确认效率。因此，用户可以根据对网络条件的判断和快速响应的需求选择适合自己的确认规则。 <div>

Abstract: A Confirmation Rule, within blockchain networks, refers to an algorithm implemented by network nodes that determines (either probabilistically or deterministically) the permanence of certain blocks on the blockchain. An example of Confirmation Ruble is the Bitcoin's longest chain Confirmation Rule where a block $b$ is confirmed (with high probability) when it has a sufficiently long chain of successors, its siblings have notably shorter successor chains, the majority of the network's total computation power (hashing) is controlled by honest nodes, and network synchrony holds.
  The only Confirmation Rule currently available in the Ethereum protocol, Gasper, is the FFG Finalization Rule. While this Confirmation Rule works under asynchronous network conditions, it is quite slow for many use cases. Specifically, best-case scenario, it takes around 13 to 19 min to confirm a transaction, where the actual figure depends on when the transaction is submitted to the network.
  In this work, we devise a Fast Confirmation Rule for Ethereum's consensus protocol. Our Confirmation Rule relies on synchrony conditions, but provides a best-case confirmation time of 12 seconds only, greatly improving on the latency of the FFG Finalization Rule.
  Users can then rely on the Confirmation Rule that best suits their needs depending on their belief about the network conditions and the need for a quick response.

总结:
本文探讨了6G赋能的车辆元宇宙中，如何利用车辆数字孪生技术解决实时车联网服务面临的挑战。针对高需求的车辆数字孪生任务和地面基站有限资源的问题，文中提出采用无人机作为空中边缘服务器辅助处理这些任务。然而，由于无人机的高流动性导致与地面基站之间存在信息不对称，进而影响到资源分配效率。为了解决这一问题，文章提出了一个基于学习的改良第二价格拍卖机制，该机制考虑了任务延迟和准确性，优化了地空基站之间的资源分配。同时，设计了一种扩散式强化学习算法来优化价格调整因子，以最大化资源提供者的总剩余价值并最小化车辆数字孪生任务的延迟。仿真结果显示，所提出的扩散式改良第二价格拍卖机制相比于传统方法具有更好的资源分布性能和服务质量提升效果。 <div>

Abstract: The rise of 6G-enable Vehicular Metaverses is transforming the automotive industry by integrating immersive, real-time vehicular services through ultra-low latency and high bandwidth connectivity. In 6G-enable Vehicular Metaverses, vehicles are represented by Vehicle Twins (VTs), which serve as digital replicas of physical vehicles to support real-time vehicular applications such as large Artificial Intelligence (AI) model-based Augmented Reality (AR) navigation, called VT tasks. VT tasks are resource-intensive and need to be offloaded to ground Base Stations (BSs) for fast processing. However, high demand for VT tasks and limited resources of ground BSs, pose significant resource allocation challenges, particularly in densely populated urban areas like intersections. As a promising solution, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) act as aerial edge servers to dynamically assist ground BSs in handling VT tasks, relieving resource pressure on ground BSs. However, due to high mobility of UAVs, there exists information asymmetry regarding VT task demands between UAVs and ground BSs, resulting in inefficient resource allocation of UAVs. To address these challenges, we propose a learning-based Modified Second-Bid (MSB) auction mechanism to optimize resource allocation between ground BSs and UAVs by accounting for VT task latency and accuracy. Moreover, we design a diffusion-based reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the price scaling factor, maximizing the total surplus of resource providers and minimizing VT task latency. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed diffusion-based MSB auction outperforms traditional baselines, providing better resource distribution and enhanced service quality for vehicular users.

Abstract: The widespread availability of maps has enabled the development of numerous location-based applications, including navigation, ride-sharing, fitness tracking, gaming, robotics, and augmented reality. Today, the maps that power these services are predominantly controlled by a few large corporations and mostly cover outdoor spaces. As the use of these applications expands and indoor localization technologies advance, we are seeing the need for a scalable, federated location management system that can extend into private spaces.
  We introduce OpenFLAME (Open Federated Localization and Mapping Engine), the first federated and decentralized localization service. OpenFLAME links servers that handle localization for specific regions, providing applications with a seamless global view. Creating a federated localization system poses challenges, such as discovering the appropriate servers for a region and integrating services managed by independent providers. To address these issues and ensure scalability, we leverage Domain Name System (DNS) for service discovery and implement map abstractions to retrieve and merge locations across different maps. Our trace-driven study demonstrates that federated localization across remote servers is feasible with acceptable query latencies. To highlight the potential of the system, we developed an augmented reality navigation application for a large indoor space, showing that OpenFLAME can successfully power location-based applications.

Abstract: Many nations are promoting the green transition in the energy sector to attain neutral carbon emissions by 2050. Smart Grid 2.0 (SG2) is expected to explore data-driven analytics and enhance communication technologies to improve the efficiency and sustainability of distributed renewable energy systems. These features are beyond smart metering and electric surplus distribution in conventional smart grids. Given the high dependence on communication networks to connect distributed microgrids in SG2, potential cascading failures of connectivity can cause disruption to data synchronization to the remote control systems. This paper reviews security threats and defense tactics for three stakeholders: power grid operators, communication network providers, and consumers. Through the survey, we found that SG2's stakeholders are particularly vulnerable to substation attacks/vandalism, malware/ransomware threats, blockchain vulnerabilities and supply chain breakdowns. Furthermore, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into autonomous energy management in distributed energy resources of SG2 creates new challenges. Accordingly, adversarial samples and false data injection on electricity reading and measurement sensors at power plants can fool AI-powered control functions and cause messy error-checking operations in energy storage, wrong energy estimation in electric vehicle charging, and even fraudulent transactions in peer-to-peer energy trading models. Scalable blockchain-based models, physical unclonable function, interoperable security protocols, and trustworthy AI models designed for managing distributed microgrids in SG2 are typical promising protection models for future research.

Abstract: This scoping review examines the broad applications, risks, and ethical challenges associated with Extended Reality (XR) technologies, including Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), within the context of Metaverse. XR is revolutionizing fields such as immersive learning in education, medical and professional training, neuropsychological assessment, therapeutic interventions, arts, entertainment, retail, e-commerce, remote work, sports, architecture, urban planning, and cultural heritage preservation. The integration of multimodal technologies such as haptics, eye-tracking, face- and body-tracking, and brain-computer interfaces, enhances user engagement and interactivity, playing a key role in shaping the immersive experiences in the Metaverse. However, XR's expansion raises serious concerns, including data privacy risks, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, cybersickness, addiction, dissociation, harassment, bullying, and misinformation. These psychological, social, and security challenges are further complicated by intense advertising, manipulation of public opinion, and social inequality, which could disproportionately affect vulnerable individuals and social groups. This review emphasizes the urgent need for robust ethical frameworks and regulatory guidelines to address these risks while promoting equitable access, privacy, autonomy, and mental well-being. As XR technologies increasingly integrate with artificial intelligence, responsible governance is essential to ensure the safe and beneficial development of the Metaverse and the broader application of XR in enhancing human development.

Abstract: The increasing volume and complexity of IoT systems demand a transition from the cloud-centric model to a decentralized IoT architecture in the so-called Computing Continuum, with no or minimal reliance on central servers. This paradigm shift, however, raises novel research concerns for decentralized coordination, calling for accurate policies. However, building such strategies is not trivial. Our work aims to relieve the DevOps engineers from this concern and propose a solution for autonomous, decentralized task allocation at runtime for IoT systems. To this end, we present a semantic communication approach and an ad-hoc lightweight coordination strategy based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). We compare the ACO strategy with Random Search and Gossip protocol-based algorithms. We conduct accurate experiments with up to a hundred nodes in both a static and a dynamic environment, i.e., with device outages. We show that ACO finds a matching node with the smallest hops and messages sent. While the Gossip strategy can allocate the most tasks successfully, ACO scales better, thus being a promising candidate for decentralized task coordination in IoT clusters.

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) leverages blockchain-enabled smart contracts to deliver automated and trustless financial services without the need for intermediaries. However, the public visibility of financial transactions on the blockchain can be exploited, as participants can reorder, insert, or remove transactions to extract value, often at the expense of others. This extracted value is known as the Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). MEV causes financial losses and consensus instability, disrupting the security, efficiency, and decentralization goals of the DeFi ecosystem. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze, detect, and mitigate MEV to safeguard DeFi. Our comprehensive survey offers a holistic view of the MEV landscape in the DeFi ecosystem. We present an in-depth understanding of MEV through a novel taxonomy of MEV transactions supported by real transaction examples. We perform a critical comparative analysis of various MEV detection approaches, evaluating their effectiveness in identifying different transaction types. Furthermore, we assess different categories of MEV mitigation strategies and discuss their limitations. We identify the challenges of current mitigation and detection approaches and discuss potential solutions. This survey provides valuable insights for researchers, developers, stakeholders, and policymakers, helping to curb and democratize MEV for a more secure and efficient DeFi ecosystem.

Abstract: Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is a promising solution for access control in cloud services. However, the heavy decryption overhead hinders its widespread adoption. A general approach to address this issue is to outsource decryption to decryption cloud service(DCS). Existing schemes have utilized various methods to enable users to verify outsourced results; however, they lack an effective mechanism to achieve exemptibility which enables the honest DCS to escape from wrong claims. And it is impractical to assume that the DCS will provide free services. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based payable outsourced decryption ABE scheme that achieves both verifiability and exemptibility without adding redundant information to ABE ciphertext. We use zero-knowledge proof to verify outsourced results on blockchain and introduce an optional single-round challenge game under optimistic assumption to address the high cost of proof generation. Moreover, our system achieves fairness and decentralized outsourcing to protect the interests of all parties. Finally, we implement and evaluate our scheme on Ethereum to demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency, the gas usage in attribute numbers from 5 to 60 is 11$\times$ to 140$\times$ in the happy case and 4$\times$ to 55$\times$ in the challenge case lower than the scheme of Ge et al. (TDSC'23).

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has steadily improved across a wide range of tasks. However, the development and deployment of AI are almost entirely controlled by a few powerful organizations that are racing to create Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The centralized entities make decisions with little public oversight, shaping the future of humanity, often with unforeseen consequences. In this paper, we propose OML, which stands for Open, Monetizable, and Loyal AI, an approach designed to democratize AI development. OML is realized through an interdisciplinary framework spanning AI, blockchain, and cryptography. We present several ideas for constructing OML using technologies such as Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), traditional cryptographic primitives like fully homomorphic encryption and functional encryption, obfuscation, and AI-native solutions rooted in the sample complexity and intrinsic hardness of AI tasks. A key innovation of our work is introducing a new scientific field: AI-native cryptography. Unlike conventional cryptography, which focuses on discrete data and binary security guarantees, AI-native cryptography exploits the continuous nature of AI data representations and their low-dimensional manifolds, focusing on improving approximate performance. One core idea is to transform AI attack methods, such as data poisoning, into security tools. This novel approach serves as a foundation for OML 1.0 which uses model fingerprinting to protect the integrity and ownership of AI models. The spirit of OML is to establish a decentralized, open, and transparent platform for AI development, enabling the community to contribute, monetize, and take ownership of AI models. By decentralizing control and ensuring transparency through blockchain technology, OML prevents the concentration of power and provides accountability in AI development that has not been possible before.

<div> 关键词: Web3、EIP-4844、以太坊、Layer-2扩容、交易策略

<br /><br />总结:
本文详细研究了EIP-4844在以太坊实施后新兴的Layer-2扩容解决方案中，构建者（builders）和rollups市场的战略变化。研究涉及数亿笔交易数据，发现构建者和rollups的效率相互依赖，无法同时优化：当构建者高效运作时，rollups可能在费用上支付过多；反之，若rollups优化成本，则可能导致构建者因交易选择效率低下而亏损。数据显示，约29.48%的区块构造不甚高效，使构建者利润不足；而从rollups角度看，超过72.53%的type-3交易支付了不必要的费用，给rollups带来了显著的经济成本。因此，本文为优化区块链构造和交易策略提供了关键洞见，旨在提升Web3基础设施的经济效率与数据可扩展性，但同时也强调了平衡构建者与rollups效率之间的挑战。 <div>

Abstract: Web3 is reshaping decentralized ecosystems through innovations like Ethereum. Recently, EIP-4844 is implemented in Ethereum to support its Layer-2 scaling solutions, which introduces a new 128 KB data structure called blob. This upgrade incorporates type-3 transactions with blobs to verify data availability and reduce gas costs for rollups, significantly affecting the strategies of both builders and rollups. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of emerging strategies in builder and rollup markets after EIP-4844, containing hundred million transactions. We find that the efficiency of builder and rollup strategies is interdependent, akin to two sides of the same coin -- both cannot be optimized simultaneously. That is, when builders operate efficiently, rollups tend to overpay in fees, conversely, when rollups optimize their costs, builders may incur losses in inefficient transaction selection. From the side of builders, our results show that 29.48% of these blocks have been constructed inefficiently, which does not produce sufficient profits for builders. Through our evaluation from the side of rollups, we find that over 72.53% of type-3 transactions pay unnecessary fees, leading to notable economic costs of rollups. Our work provides critical insights into optimizing block construction and transaction strategies, advancing the economic efficiency and data scalability of Web3 infrastructures, yet, much like balancing a seesaw, the efficiency of builders and rollups cannot be optimized concurrently.

Abstract: The SECP256K1 elliptic curve algorithm is fundamental in cryptocurrency wallets for generating secure public keys from private keys, thereby ensuring the protection and ownership of blockchain-based digital assets. However, the literature highlights several successful side-channel attacks on hardware wallets that exploit SECP256K1 to extract private keys. This work proposes a novel hardware architecture for SECP256K1, optimized for side-channel attack resistance and efficient resource utilization. The architecture incorporates complete addition formulas, temporary registers, and parallel processing techniques, making elliptic curve point addition and doubling operations indistinguishable. Implementation results demonstrate an average reduction of 45% in LUT usage compared to similar works, emphasizing the design's resource efficiency.

Abstract: Blockchains are being positioned as the "technology of trust" that can be used to mediate transactions between non-trusting parties without the need for a central authority. They support transaction types that are native to the blockchain platform or user-defined via user programs called smart contracts. Despite the significant flexibility in transaction programmability that smart contracts offer, they pose several usability, robustness, and performance challenges.
  This paper proposes an alternative transaction framework that incorporates more primitives into the native set of transaction types (reducing the likelihood of requiring user-defined transaction programs often). The framework is based on the concept of declarative blockchain transactions whose strength lies in the fact that it addresses several of the limitations of smart contracts simultaneously. A formal and implementation framework is presented, and a subset of commonly occurring transaction behaviors are modeled and implemented as use cases, using an open-source blockchain database, BigchchainDB, as the implementation context. A performance study comparing the declarative transaction approach to equivalent smart contract transaction models reveals several advantages of the proposed approach.

<br /><br />总结:

本文提出了一种用于碳价格波动预测的新型混合机器学习方法。该方法结合了DILATED卷积神经网络（CNN）和长短期记忆（LSTM）神经网络算法，提升了特征提取效率。在DILATED CNN-LSTM框架基础上，采用L1和L2参数范数惩罚作为正则化手段进行预测，并通过正则化过程引入了与区块链信息相关的指标。实验使用大量数据集对碳价格进行了预测，结果显示，DILATED CNN-LSTM框架优于传统的CNN-LSTM架构，同时区块链信息能有效预测碳价格。在正则化方法中，相比于L1正则化的Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation Penalty (SCAD)，L2正则化的Ridge Regression (RR)在价格预测上表现更优。因此，提出的RR-DILATED CNN-LSTM方法能有效地、准确地预测碳价格的波动趋势，为学术界和业界提供了一个新的理论依据和预测方法，尤其对于以碳价为代表的数字资产政策评估及趋势预测具有重要意义。 <div>

Abstract: In this study, the novel hybrid machine learning approach is proposed in carbon price fluctuation prediction. Specifically, a research framework integrating DILATED Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network algorithm is proposed. The advantage of the combined framework is that it can make feature extraction more efficient. Then, based on the DILATED CNN-LSTM framework, the L1 and L2 parameter norm penalty as regularization method is adopted to predict. Referring to the characteristics of high correlation between energy indicator price and blockchain information in previous literature, and we primarily includes indicators related to blockchain information through regularization process. Based on the above methods, this paper uses a dataset containing an amount of data to carry out the carbon price prediction. The experimental results show that the DILATED CNN-LSTM framework is superior to the traditional CNN-LSTM architecture. Blockchain information can effectively predict the price. Since parameter norm penalty as regularization, Ridge Regression (RR) as L2 regularization is better than Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation Penalty (SCAD) as L1 regularization in price forecasting. Thus, the proposed RR-DILATED CNN-LSTM approach can effectively and accurately predict the fluctuation trend of the carbon price. Therefore, the new forecasting methods and theoretical ecology proposed in this study provide a new basis for trend prediction and evaluating digital assets policy represented by the carbon price for both the academia and practitioners.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning method for training with private data locally stored in distributed machines without gathering them into one place for central learning. Despite its promises, FL is prone to critical security risks. First, because FL depends on a central server to aggregate local training models, this is a single point of failure. The server might function maliciously. Second, due to its distributed nature, FL might encounter backdoor attacks by participating clients. They can poison the local model before submitting to the server. Either type of attack, on the server or the client side, would severely degrade learning accuracy. We propose FedBlock, a novel blockchain-based FL framework that addresses both of these security risks. FedBlock is uniquely desirable in that it involves only smart contract programming, thus deployable atop any blockchain network. Our framework is substantiated with a comprehensive evaluation study using real-world datasets. Its robustness against backdoor attacks is competitive with the literature of FL backdoor defense. The latter, however, does not address the server risk as we do.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Real-World Assets (RWA), the importance of blockchain oracles in real-time data acquisition has become increasingly prominent. Using cryptographic techniques, threshold signature oracles can achieve consensus on data from multiple nodes and provide corresponding proofs to ensure the credibility and security of the information. However, in real-time data acquisition, threshold signature methods face challenges such as data inconsistency and low success rates in heterogeneous environments, which limit their practical application potential. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative dual-strategy approach to enhance the success rate of data consensus in blockchain threshold signature oracles. Firstly, we introduce a Representative Enhanced Aggregation Strategy (REP-AG) that improves the representativeness of data submitted by nodes, ensuring consistency with data from other nodes, and thereby enhancing the usability of threshold signatures. Additionally, we present a Timing Optimization Strategy (TIM-OPT) that dynamically adjusts the timing of nodes' access to data sources to maximize consensus success rates. Experimental results indicate that REP-AG improves the aggregation success rate by approximately 56.6\% compared to the optimal baseline, while the implementation of TIM-OPT leads to an average increase of approximately 32.9\% in consensus success rates across all scenarios.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a privacy preserving decentralized machine learning paradigm designed to collaboratively train models across multiple clients by exchanging gradients to the server and keeping private data local. Nevertheless, recent research has revealed that the security of Federated Learning is compromised, as private ground truth data can be recovered through a gradient inversion technique known as Deep Leakage. While these attacks are crafted with a focus on applications in Federated Learning, they generally are not evaluated in realistic scenarios. This paper introduces the FEDLAD Framework (Federated Evaluation of Deep Leakage Attacks and Defenses), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Deep Leakage attacks and defenses within a realistic Federated context. By implementing a unified benchmark that encompasses multiple state-of-the-art Deep Leakage techniques and various defense strategies, our framework facilitates the evaluation and comparison of the efficacy of these methods across different datasets and training states. This work highlights a crucial trade-off between privacy and model accuracy in Federated Learning and aims to advance the understanding of security challenges in decentralized machine learning systems, stimulate future research, and enhance reproducibility in evaluating Deep Leakage attacks and defenses.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution to the privacy concerns associated with centralized Machine Learning (ML) by enabling decentralized, collaborative learning. However, FL is vulnerable to various security threats, including poisoning attacks, where adversarial clients manipulate the training data or model updates to degrade overall model performance. Recognizing this threat, researchers have focused on developing defense mechanisms to counteract poisoning attacks in FL systems. However, existing robust FL methods predominantly focus on computer vision tasks, leaving a gap in addressing the unique challenges of FL with time series data. In this paper, we present FLORAL, a defense mechanism designed to mitigate poisoning attacks in federated learning for time-series tasks, even in scenarios with heterogeneous client data and a large number of adversarial participants. Unlike traditional model-centric defenses, FLORAL leverages logical reasoning to evaluate client trustworthiness by aligning their predictions with global time-series patterns, rather than relying solely on the similarity of client updates. Our approach extracts logical reasoning properties from clients, then hierarchically infers global properties, and uses these to verify client updates. Through formal logic verification, we assess the robustness of each client contribution, identifying deviations indicative of adversarial behavior. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing baseline methods, highlighting its potential to enhance the robustness of FL to time series applications. Notably, FLORAL reduced the prediction error by 93.27\% in the best-case scenario compared to the second-best baseline.

Abstract: Decision-making in multi-player games can be extremely challenging, particularly under uncertainty. In this work, we propose a new sample-based approximation to a class of stochastic, general-sum, pure Nash games, where each player has an expected-value objective and a set of chance constraints. This new approximation scheme inherits the accuracy of objective approximation from the established sample average approximation (SAA) method and enjoys a feasibility guarantee derived from the scenario optimization literature. We characterize the sample complexity of this new game-theoretic approximation scheme, and observe that high accuracy usually requires a large number of samples, which results in a large number of sampled constraints. To accommodate this, we decompose the approximated game into a set of smaller games with few constraints for each sampled scenario, and propose a decentralized, consensus-based ADMM algorithm to efficiently compute a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) of the approximated game. We prove the convergence of our algorithm to a GNE and empirically demonstrate superior performance relative to a recent baseline algorithm based on ADMM and interior point method.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative approach in healthcare, enabling collaborative model training across decentralized data sources while preserving user privacy. However, performance of FL rapidly degrades in practical scenarios due to the inherent bias in non Independent and Identically distributed (non-IID) data among participating clients, which poses significant challenges to model accuracy and generalization. Therefore, we propose the Bias-Aware Client Selection Algorithm (BACSA), which detects user bias and strategically selects clients based on their bias profiles. In addition, the proposed algorithm considers privacy preservation, fairness and constraints of wireless network environments, making it suitable for sensitive healthcare applications where Quality of Service (QoS), privacy and security are paramount. Our approach begins with a novel method for detecting user bias by analyzing model parameters and correlating them with the distribution of class-specific data samples. We then formulate a mixed-integer non-linear client selection problem leveraging the detected bias, alongside wireless network constraints, to optimize FL performance. We demonstrate that BACSA improves convergence and accuracy, compared to existing benchmarks, through evaluations on various data distributions, including Dirichlet and class-constrained scenarios. Additionally, we explore the trade-offs between accuracy, fairness, and network constraints, indicating the adaptability and robustness of BACSA to address diverse healthcare applications.

总结:<br />
随着去中心化金融(DeFi)的发展，其带来了新的金融机遇，但也暴露了严重的安全漏洞，尤其是闪贷常被用于价格操纵攻击。这类攻击利用闪贷的原子性来操纵DeFi协议的预言机和定价机制，导致重大财务损失。尽管现有的智能合约分析工具能够解决一些安全风险，但它们往往难以检测到构成闪贷攻击挑战性的复杂跨合约依赖关系。为此，研究者提出了一种名为FlashDeFier的高级检测框架，该框架扩展了静态污点分析的应用，以针对源自闪贷的价格操纵漏洞。FlashDeFier通过构建详细的跨合约调用图，全面分析了DeFi协议中的数据流，从而显著提高了检测准确性。实验证明，FlashDeFier在针对一系列知名DeFi事件的数据集中，识别出了76.4%的价格操纵漏洞，相较于DeFiTainter有30%的提升。这些结果强调了适应性检测框架对于随DeFi威胁演进而发展的必要性，并指出需要结合静态、动态和符号分析方法的混合方法来实现DeFi安全的韧性。 <div>

Abstract: The rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has brought novel financial opportunities but also exposed serious security vulnerabilities, with flash loans frequently exploited for price manipulation attacks. These attacks, leveraging the atomic nature of flash loans, allow malicious actors to manipulate DeFi protocol oracles and pricing mechanisms within a single transaction, causing substantial financial losses. Traditional smart contract analysis tools address some security risks but often struggle to detect the complex, inter-contract dependencies that make flash loan attacks challenging to identify.
  In response, we introduce FlashDeFier, an advanced detection framework that enhances static taint analysis to target price manipulation vulnerabilities arising from flash loans. FlashDeFier expands the scope of taint sources and sinks, enabling comprehensive analysis of data flows across DeFi protocols. The framework constructs detailed inter-contract call graphs to capture sophisticated data flow patterns, significantly improving detection accuracy. Tested against a dataset of high-profile DeFi incidents, FlashDeFier identifies 76.4% of price manipulation vulnerabilities, marking a 30% improvement over DeFiTainter. These results highlight the importance of adaptive detection frameworks that evolve alongside DeFi threats, underscoring the need for hybrid approaches combining static, dynamic, and symbolic analysis methods for resilient DeFi security.

Abstract: Deep learning is an emerging field revolutionizing various industries, including natural language processing, computer vision, and many more. These domains typically require an extensive amount of data for optimal performance, potentially utilizing huge centralized data repositories. However, such centralization could raise privacy issues concerning the storage of sensitive data. To address this issue, federated learning was developed. It is a newly distributed learning technique that enables to collaboratively train a deep learning model on decentralized devices, referred to as clients, without compromising their data privacy. Traditional federated learning methods often suffer from severe performance degradation when the data distribution among clients differs significantly. This becomes especially problematic in the case of label distribution skew, where the distribution of labels varies across clients. To address this, a novel method called FedEntOpt is proposed. FedEntOpt is designed to mitigate performance issues caused by label distribution skew by maximizing the entropy of the global label distribution of the selected client subset in each federated learning round. This ensures that the aggregated model parameters from the clients were exhibited to data from all available labels, which improves the accuracy of the global model. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms by up to 6% in classification accuracy, demonstrating robust and superior performance, particularly under low participation rates. In addition, it offers the flexibility to be combined with them, enhancing their performance by over 40%.

Abstract: While recent years have witnessed the advancement in big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI), it is of much importance to safeguard data privacy and security. As an innovative approach, Federated Learning (FL) addresses these concerns by facilitating collaborative model training across distributed data sources without transferring raw data.

Abstract: Tokens have proliferated across blockchains in terms of number, market capitalisation and utility. Some tokens are tokenised versions of existing tokens -- known variously as wrapped tokens, fractional tokens, or shares. The repeated application of this process creates matryoshkian tokens of arbitrary depth. We perform an empirical analysis of token composition on the Ethereum blockchain. We introduce a graph that represents the tokenisation of tokens by other tokens, and we show that the graph contains non-trivial topological structure. We relate properties of the graph, e.g., connected components and cyclic structure, to the tokenisation process. For example, we identify the longest directed path and its corresponding sequence of tokens, and we visualise the connected components relating to a stablecoin and an NFT protocol. Our goal is to explore and visualise what has been wrought with tokens, rather than add yet another brick to the edifice.

Abstract: Socio-technical networks represent emerging cyber-physical infrastructures that are tightly interwoven with human networks. The coupling between human and technical networks presents significant challenges in managing, controlling, and securing these complex, interdependent systems. This paper investigates game-theoretic frameworks for the design and control of socio-technical networks, with a focus on critical applications such as misinformation management, infrastructure optimization, and resilience in socio-cyber-physical systems (SCPS). Core methodologies, including Stackelberg games, mechanism design, and dynamic game theory, are examined as powerful tools for modeling interactions in hierarchical, multi-agent environments. Key challenges addressed include mitigating human-driven vulnerabilities, managing large-scale system dynamics, and countering adversarial threats. By bridging individual agent behaviors with overarching system goals, this work illustrates how the integration of game theory and control theory can lead to robust, resilient, and adaptive socio-technical networks. This paper highlights the potential of these frameworks to dynamically align decentralized agent actions with system-wide objectives of stability, security, and efficiency.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that achieves a globally robust model through decentralized computation and periodic model synthesis, primarily focusing on the global model's accuracy over aggregated datasets of all participating clients. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) instead tailors exclusive models for each client, aiming to enhance the accuracy of clients' individual models on specific local data distributions. Despite of their wide adoption, existing FL and PFL works have yet to comprehensively address the class-imbalance issue, one of the most critical challenges within the realm of data heterogeneity in PFL and FL research. In this paper, we propose FedReMa, an efficient PFL algorithm that can tackle class-imbalance by 1) utilizing an adaptive inter-client co-learning approach to identify and harness different clients' expertise on different data classes throughout various phases of the training process, and 2) employing distinct aggregation methods for clients' feature extractors and classifiers, with the choices informed by the different roles and implications of these model components. Specifically, driven by our experimental findings on inter-client similarity dynamics, we develop critical co-learning period (CCP), wherein we introduce a module named maximum difference segmentation (MDS) to assess and manage task relevance by analyzing the similarities between clients' logits of their classifiers. Outside the CCP, we employ an additional scheme for model aggregation that utilizes historical records of each client's most relevant peers to further enhance the personalization stability. We demonstrate the superiority of our FedReMa in extensive experiments.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) aims to learn from sequential data stream in the decentralized federated learning setting, while simultaneously mitigating the catastrophic forgetting issue in classical continual learning. Existing FCL methods usually employ typical rehearsal mechanisms, which could result in privacy violations or additional onerous storage and computational burdens. In this work, an efficient and non-IID robust federated continual learning framework, called Federated Prototype-Augmented Prompt Learning (FPPL), is proposed. The FPPL can collaboratively learn lightweight prompts augmented by prototypes without rehearsal. On the client side, a fusion function is employed to fully leverage the knowledge contained in task-specific prompts for alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, global prototypes aggregated from the server are used to obtain unified representation through contrastive learning, mitigating the impact of non-IID-derived data heterogeneity. On the server side, locally uploaded prototypes are utilized to perform debiasing on the classifier, further alleviating the performance degradation caused by both non-IID and catastrophic forgetting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of FPPL, achieving notable performance with an efficient design while remaining robust to diverse non-IID degrees.

Abstract: The effective distribution of user transmit powers is essential for the significant advancements that the emergence of 6G wireless networks brings. In recent studies, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been employed to address this challenge. However, these methods frequently encounter issues regarding fairness and computational inefficiency when making decisions, rendering them unsuitable for future dynamic services that depend heavily on the participation of each individual user. To address this gap, this paper focuses on the challenge of transmit power allocation in wireless networks, aiming to optimize $\alpha$-fairness to balance network utilization and user equity. We introduce a novel approach utilizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a class of machine learning models that offer low inference costs compared to traditional DNNs through superior explainability. The study provides a comprehensive problem formulation, establishing the NP-hardness of the power allocation problem. Then, two algorithms are proposed for dataset generation and decentralized KAN training, offering a flexible framework for achieving various fairness objectives in dynamic 6G environments. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of fairness and inference cost. The results underscore the potential of KANs to overcome the limitations of existing DNN-based methods, particularly in scenarios that demand rapid adaptation and fairness.

Abstract: The randomized power method has gained significant interest due to its simplicity and efficient handling of large-scale spectral analysis and recommendation tasks. As modern datasets contain sensitive private information, we need to give formal guarantees on the possible privacy leaks caused by this method. This paper focuses on enhancing privacy preserving variants of the method. We propose a strategy to reduce the variance of the noise introduced to achieve Differential Privacy (DP). We also adapt the method to a decentralized framework with a low computational and communication overhead, while preserving the accuracy. We leverage Secure Aggregation (a form of Multi-Party Computation) to allow the algorithm to perform computations using data distributed among multiple users or devices, without revealing individual data. We show that it is possible to use a noise scale in the decentralized setting that is similar to the one in the centralized setting. We improve upon existing convergence bounds for both the centralized and decentralized versions. The proposed method is especially relevant for decentralized applications such as distributed recommender systems, where privacy concerns are paramount.

Abstract: Zero-knowledge (ZK) protocols have recently found numerous practical applications, such as in authentication, online-voting, and blockchain systems. These protocols are powered by highly complex pipelines that process deterministic programs, called circuits, written in one of many domain-specific programming languages, e.g., Circom, Noir, and others. Logic bugs in circuit-processing pipelines could have catastrophic consequences and cause significant financial and reputational damage. As an example, consider that a logic bug in a ZK pipeline could result in attackers stealing identities or assets. It is, therefore, critical to develop effective techniques for checking their correctness.
  In this paper, we present the first systematic fuzzing technique for ZK pipelines, which uses metamorphic test oracles to detect critical logic bugs. We have implemented our technique in an open-source tool called Circuzz. We used Circuzz to test four significantly different ZK pipelines and found a total of 16 logic bugs in all pipelines. Due to their critical nature, 15 of our bugs have already been fixed by the pipeline developers.

Abstract: In Industry 4.0 systems, a considerable number of resource-constrained Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices engage in frequent data interactions due to the necessity for model training, which gives rise to concerns pertaining to security and privacy. In order to address these challenges, this paper considers a digital twin (DT) and blockchain-assisted federated learning (FL) scheme. To facilitate the FL process, we initially employ fog devices with abundant computational capabilities to generate DT for resource-constrained edge devices, thereby aiding them in local training. Subsequently, we formulate an FL delay minimization problem for FL, which considers both of model transmission time and synchronization time, also incorporates cooperative jamming to ensure secure synchronization of DT. To address this non-convex optimization problem, we propose a decomposition algorithm. In particular, we introduce upper limits on the local device training delay and the effects of aggregation jamming as auxiliary variables, thereby transforming the problem into a convex optimization problem that can be decomposed for independent solution. Finally, a blockchain verification mechanism is employed to guarantee the integrity of the model uploading throughout the FL process and the identities of the participants. The final global model is obtained from the verified local and global models within the blockchain through the application of deep learning techniques. The efficacy of our proposed cooperative interference-based FL process has been verified through numerical analysis, which demonstrates that the integrated DT blockchain-assisted FL scheme significantly outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of execution time, block optimization, and accuracy.

Abstract: Two-sided matching markets, environments in which two disjoint groups of agents seek to partner with one another, arise in many practical applications. In settings where the agents can assess the quality of their possible partners a priori, well-known centralized algorithms can be used to find desirable matchings between the two groups. However, when they do not know their own preferences, such algorithms are no longer applicable and agents must instead learn their preferences through repeated interactions with one another. In this work, we design completely uncoupled and uncoordinated policies that use an agent's limited historical observations to guide their behavior towards desirable matchings when they do not know their preferences. In our first main contribution, we demonstrate that when every agent follows a simple policy which we call trial-and-error learning, they will converge to a stable matching, the standard equilibrium configuration in matching markets. Then, we evaluate the strategyproofness of this policy and ask whether one group of agents can improve their performance by following a different policy. We constructively answer this question in the affirmative, demonstrating that if one group follows simple trial-and-error learning while the second group follows a more advanced policy, then they will converge to the most preferable stable matching for the second group. To the best of the authors' knowledge, these are the first completely uncoupled and uncoordinated policies that demonstrate any notion of convergence to stability in decentralized markets with two-sided uncertainty.

Abstract: This paper leverages various philosophical and ontological frameworks to explore the concept of embodied artificial general intelligence (AGI), its relationship to human consciousness, and the key role of the metaverse in facilitating this relationship. Several theoretical frameworks underpin this exploration, such as embodied cognition, Michael Levin's computational boundary of a "Self," Donald D. Hoffman's Interface Theory of Perception, and Bernardo Kastrup's analytical idealism, which lead to considering our perceived outer reality as a symbolic representation of alternate inner states of being, and where AGI could embody a higher consciousness with a larger computational boundary. The paper further discusses the developmental stages of AGI, the requirements for the emergence of an embodied AGI, the importance of a calibrated symbolic interface for AGI, and the key role played by the metaverse, decentralized systems, open-source blockchain technology, as well as open-source AI research. It also explores the idea of a feedback loop between AGI and human users in metaverse spaces as a tool for AGI calibration, as well as the role of local homeostasis and decentralized governance as preconditions for achieving a stable embodied AGI. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of achieving a certain degree of harmony in human relations and recognizing the interconnectedness of humanity at a global level, as key prerequisites for the emergence of a stable embodied AGI.

Abstract: Mobile robots in unknown cluttered environments with irregularly shaped obstacles often face sensing, energy, and communication challenges which directly affect their ability to explore these environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, Confidence-Aware Contrastive Conditional Consistency Model (4CNet), for robot map prediction during decentralized, resource-limited multi-robot exploration. 4CNet uniquely incorporates: 1) a conditional consistency model for map prediction in unstructured unknown regions, 2) a contrastive map-trajectory pretraining framework for a trajectory encoder that extracts spatial information from the trajectories of nearby robots during map prediction, and 3) a confidence network to measure the uncertainty of map prediction for effective exploration under resource constraints. We incorporate 4CNet within our proposed robot exploration with map prediction architecture, 4CNet-E. We then conduct extensive comparison studies with 4CNet-E and state-of-the-art heuristic and learning methods to investigate both map prediction and exploration performance in environments consisting of irregularly shaped obstacles and uneven terrain. Results showed that 4CNet-E obtained statistically significant higher prediction accuracy and area coverage with varying environment sizes, number of robots, energy budgets, and communication limitations. Hardware experiments were performed and validated the applicability and generalizability of 4CNet-E in both unstructured indoor and real natural outdoor environments.

Abstract: Automated plot generation for games enhances the player's experience by providing rich and immersive narrative experience that adapts to the player's actions. Traditional approaches adopt a symbolic narrative planning method which limits the scale and complexity of the generated plot by requiring extensive knowledge engineering work. Recent advancements use Large Language Models (LLMs) to drive the behavior of virtual characters, allowing plots to emerge from interactions between characters and their environments. However, the emergent nature of such decentralized plot generation makes it difficult for authors to direct plot progression. We propose a novel plot creation workflow that mediates between a writer's authorial intent and the emergent behaviors from LLM-driven character simulation, through a novel authorial structure called "abstract acts". The writers define high-level plot outlines that are later transformed into concrete character action sequences via an LLM-based narrative planning process, based on the game world state. The process creates "living stories" that dynamically adapt to various game world states, resulting in narratives co-created by the author, character simulation, and player. We present StoryVerse as a proof-of-concept system to demonstrate this plot creation workflow. We showcase the versatility of our approach with examples in different stories and game environments.

Abstract: Decentralized social networks like Mastodon and BlueSky are trending topics that have drawn much attention and discussion in recent years. By devolving powers from the central node to the end users, decentralized social networks aim to cure existing pathologies on the centralized platforms and have been viewed by many as the future of the Internet. This article critically and systematically assesses the decentralization project's prospect for communications online. It uses normative theories of free speech to examine whether and how the decentralization design could facilitate users' freedom of expression online. The analysis shows that both promises and pitfalls exist, highlighting the importance of value-based design in this area. Two most salient issues for the design of the decentralized networks are: how to balance the decentralization ideal with constant needs of centralization on the network, and how to empower users to make them truly capable of exercising their control. The article then uses some design examples, such as the shared blocklist and the opt-in search function, to illustrate the value considerations underlying the design choices. Some tentative proposals for law and policy interventions are offered to better facilitate the design of the new network. Rather than providing clear answers, the article seeks to map the value implications of the design choices, highlight the stakes, and point directions for future research.

总结:
本文研究了空间分布系统的集中式最优估计算题。文章重点关注了在空间不变系统中的理想化情况，并探讨了最优集中估计器在空间上的局部性，即其增益随空间距离递减，以此来衡量在分布式估算中需要共享信息的距离。研究分析了影响空间衰减率的各种参数，如系统动力学、测量噪声和过程噪声方差及其空间自相关性。文中提出了非标度参数，用于刻画衰减率与问题规格的关系，并发现了一个动态特性长度尺度与测量噪声相关长度尺度相匹配的条件，此时最优集中估计器完全去中心化。为了量化空间衰减率，文章引入了一种新的技术——分支点轨迹法。通过两个案例研究，分别涉及扩散模型和Swift-Hohenberg方程驱动的动力系统，展示了本文结果的应用。 <div>

Abstract: We consider the centralized optimal estimation problem in spatially distributed systems. We use the setting of spatially invariant systems as an idealization for which concrete and detailed results are given. Such estimators are known to have a degree of spatial localization in the sense that the estimator gains decay in space, with the spatial decay rates serving as a proxy for how far measurements need to be shared in an optimal distributed estimator. In particular, we examine the dependence of spatial decay rates on problem specifications such as system dynamics, measurement and process noise variances, as well as their spatial autocorrelations. We propose non-dimensional parameters that characterize the decay rates as a function of problem specifications. In particular, we find an interesting matching condition between the characteristic lengthscale of the dynamics and the measurement noise correlation lengthscale for which the optimal centralized estimator is completely decentralized. A new technique - termed the Branch Point Locus - is introduced to quantify spatial decay rates in terms of analyticity regions in the complex spatial frequency plane. Our results are illustrated through two case studies of systems with dynamics modeled by diffusion and the Swift-Hohenberg equation, respectively.

Abstract: The immutable nature of blockchain technology, while revolutionary, introduces significant security challenges, particularly in smart contracts. These security issues can lead to substantial financial losses. Current tools and approaches often focus on specific types of vulnerabilities. However, a comprehensive tool capable of detecting a wide range of vulnerabilities with high accuracy is lacking. This paper introduces LLM-SmartAudit, a novel framework leveraging the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect and analyze vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Using a multi-agent conversational approach, LLM-SmartAudit employs a collaborative system with specialized agents to enhance the audit process. To evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-SmartAudit, we compiled two distinct datasets: a labeled dataset for benchmarking against traditional tools and a real-world dataset for assessing practical applications. Experimental results indicate that our solution outperforms all traditional smart contract auditing tools, offering higher accuracy and greater efficiency. Furthermore, our framework can detect complex logic vulnerabilities that traditional tools have previously overlooked. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging LLM agents provides a highly effective method for automated smart contract auditing.

Abstract: Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity due to their transparency, security, and accessibility compared to traditional financial systems, with Bitcoin, introduced in 2009, leading the market. Bitcoin's security relies on blockchain technology - a decentralized ledger consisting of a consensus and an incentive mechanism. The consensus mechanism, Proof of Work (PoW), requires miners to solve difficult cryptographic puzzles to add new blocks, while the incentive mechanism rewards them with newly minted bitcoins. However, as Bitcoin's acceptance grows, it faces increasing threats from attacks targeting these mechanisms, such as selfish mining, double-spending, and block withholding. These attacks compromise security, efficiency, and reward distribution. Recent research shows that these attacks can be combined with each other or with either malicious strategies, such as network-layer attacks, or non-malicious strategies, like honest mining. These combinations lead to more sophisticated attacks, increasing the attacker's success rates and profitability. Therefore, understanding and evaluating these attacks is essential for developing effective countermeasures and ensuring long-term security. This paper begins by examining individual attacks executed in isolation and their profitability. It then explores how combining these attacks with each other or with other malicious and non-malicious strategies can enhance their overall effectiveness and profitability. The analysis further explores how the deployment of attacks such as selfish mining and block withholding by multiple competing mining pools against each other impacts their economic returns. Lastly, a set of design guidelines is provided, outlining areas future work should focus on to prevent or mitigate the identified threats.

Abstract: A Blockchain Name System (BNS) simplifies the process of sending cryptocurrencies by replacing complex cryptographic recipient addresses with human-readable names, making the transactions more convenient. Unfortunately, these names can be susceptible to typosquatting attacks, where attackers can take advantage of user typos by registering typographically similar BNS names. Unsuspecting users may accidentally mistype or misinterpret the intended name, resulting in an irreversible transfer of funds to an attacker's address instead of the intended recipient. In this work, we present the first large-scale, intra-BNS typosquatting study. To understand the prevalence of typosquatting within BNSs, we study three different services (Ethereum Name Service, Unstoppable Domains, and ADAHandles) spanning three blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, and Cardano), collecting a total of 4.9M BNS names and 200M transactions-the largest dataset for BNSs to date. We describe the challenges involved in conducting name-squatting studies on these alternative naming systems, and then perform an in-depth quantitative analysis of our dataset. We find that typosquatters are indeed active on BNSs, registering more malicious domains with each passing year. Our analysis reveals that users have sent thousands of transactions to squatters and that squatters target both globally popular BNS domain names as well as the domains owned by popular Twitter/X users. Lastly, we document the complete lack of defenses against typosquatting in custodial and non-custodial wallets and propose straightforward countermeasures that can protect users without relying on third-party services.

Abstract: In the paradigm of decentralized learning, a group of agents collaborate to learn a global model using a distributed dataset without a central server; nevertheless, it is severely challenged by the heterogeneity of the data distribution across the agents. For example, the data may be distributed non-independently and identically, and even be noised or poisoned. To address these data challenges, we propose ROSS, a novel robust decentralized stochastic learning algorithm based on Shapley values, in this paper. Specifically, in each round, each agent aggregates the cross-gradient information from its neighbors, i.e., the derivatives of its local model with respect to the datasets of its neighbors, to update its local model in a momentum like manner, while we innovate in weighting the derivatives according to their contributions measured by Shapley values. We perform solid theoretical analysis to reveal the linear convergence speedup of our ROSS algorithm. We also verify the efficacy of our algorithm through extensive experiments on public datasets. Our results demonstrate that, in face of the above variety of data challenges, our ROSS algorithm have oblivious advantages over existing state-of-the-art proposals in terms of both convergence and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Blockchain interoperability protocols enable cross-chain asset transfers or data retrievals between isolated chains, which are considered as the core infrastructure for Web 3.0 applications such as decentralized finance protocols. However, existing protocols either face severe scalability issues due to high on-chain and off-chain costs, or suffer from trust concerns because of centralized designs.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{MAP}, a trustless blockchain interoperability protocol that relays cross-chain transactions across heterogeneous chains with high scalability. First, within \texttt{MAP}, we develop a novel \textit{cross-chain relay} technique, which integrates a unified relay chain architecture and on-chain light clients of different source chains, allowing the retrieval and verification of diverse cross-chain transactions. Furthermore, we reduce cross-chain verification costs by incorporating an optimized zk-based light client scheme that adaptively decouples signature verification overheads from inefficient smart contract execution and offloads them to off-chain provers. For experiments, we conducted the first large-scale evaluation on existing interoperability protocols. With \texttt{MAP}, the required number of on-chain light clients is reduced from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$, with around 35\% reduction in on-chain costs and 25\% reduction for off-chain costs when verifying cross-chain transactions.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness, we deployed \texttt{MAP} in the real world. By 2024, we have supported over six popular public chains, 50 cross-chain applications and relayed over 200K cross-chain transactions worth over 640 million USD. Based on rich practical experiences, we constructed the first real-world cross-chain dataset to further advance blockchain interoperability research.

本文关注以太坊当前采用的共识协议Gasper存在的问题，其最终性延迟为64至95个槽，这在网络条件变化时容易导致区块链重组，特别是在异步环境中，增加了对最大可提取价值(MEV)攻击的风险，并使得用户在经济安全和交易速度之间不得不做出权衡。为此，文章提出了一个部分同步最终性装置，并将其与两个动态可用的共识协议相结合，创建了安全的ebb-and-flow协议。这种整合方案能够在提案提出后仅三个槽的时间内实现最终性，即实现了3槽最终性，显著提升了最终性的速度和网络安全性。 <div>
arXiv:2411.00558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gasper, the consensus protocol currently employed by Ethereum, typically requires 64 to 95 slots -- the units of time during which a new chain extending the previous one by one block is proposed and voted -- to finalize. This means that under ideal conditions -- where the network is synchronous, and all chain proposers, along with more than two-thirds of the validators, behave as dictated by the protocol -- proposers construct blocks on a non-finalized chain that extends at least 64 blocks. This exposes a significant portion of the blockchain to potential reorganizations during changes in network conditions, such as periods of asynchrony. Specifically, this finalization delay heightens the network's exposure to Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) exploits, which could undermine the network's integrity. Furthermore, the extended finalization period forces users to balance the trade-off between economic security and transaction speed.
  To address these issues and speed up finality, we introduce a partially synchronous finality gadget, which we combine with two dynamically available consensus protocols -- synchronous protocols that ensure safety and liveness even with fluctuating validator participation levels. This integration results in secure ebb-and-flow protocols [SP 2021], achieving finality within three slots after a proposal and realizing 3-slot finality.

Abstract: We study the decentralized online regularized linear regression algorithm over random time-varying graphs. At each time step, every node runs an online estimation algorithm consisting of an innovation term processing its own new measurement, a consensus term taking a weighted sum of estimations of its own and its neighbors with additive and multiplicative communication noises and a regularization term preventing over-fitting. It is not required that the regression matrices and graphs satisfy special statistical assumptions such as mutual independence, spatio-temporal independence or stationarity. We develop the nonnegative supermartingale inequality of the estimation error, and prove that the estimations of all nodes converge to the unknown true parameter vector almost surely if the algorithm gains, graphs and regression matrices jointly satisfy the sample path spatio-temporal persistence of excitation condition. Especially, this condition holds by choosing appropriate algorithm gains if the graphs are uniformly conditionally jointly connected and conditionally balanced, and the regression models of all nodes are uniformly conditionally spatio-temporally jointly observable, under which the algorithm converges in mean square and almost surely. In addition, we prove that the regret upper bound is $O(T^{1-\tau}\ln T)$, where $\tau\in (0.5,1)$ is a constant depending on the algorithm gains.

Abstract: The transition of Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism introduces a transformative approach to blockchain validation, offering enhanced scalability, energy efficiency, and security. However, this shift also presents significant challenges, including high barriers to becoming a validator, restrictions on the liquidity of staked Ether (ETH), and the risk of centralization due to staking pool dynamics. This paper addresses these challenges by exploring two innovative solutions: EigenLayer and Lido.
  EigenLayer is a middleware solution enabling restaking, allowing validators to secure multiple protocols and thereby increasing decentralization and profitability. Lido, a liquid staking protocol, simplifies participation by issuing stETH tokens that retain liquidity, allowing users to earn rewards without long-term lock-up constraints. This paper provides a detailed analysis of how these technologies mitigate key PoS challenges, reduce validator entry barriers, unlock staked capital, and improve decentralization. We conclude with an evaluation of the combined potential of EigenLayer and Lido to foster a more resilient and inclusive Ethereum ecosystem, setting the stage for further advancements in decentralized finance.

<div> 关键词：区块链、数据查询、可验证性、效率、EVeCA框架

总结:
随着区块链应用日益普及，对链上数据查询的需求不断增长。然而，当前的链上数据查询方案在可验证性和效率之间存在权衡问题。为解决这一局限，本文提出了一个高效且可验证的链上数据查询框架——EVeCA。该框架通过将授权数据结构（ADS）的维护任务委托给有限数量的节点，减轻了全节点的负担，同时利用挑战认证方案保证全节点能有效验证ADS的正确性，极大地降低了服务提供者维护错误ADS的可能性。通过精心设计ADS验证机制，EVeCA在保持抵抗适应性攻击能力的同时实现了更高的效率。此外，它还避免了全节点需要直接维护链上ADS的情况，使全节点以更为经济的方式参与ADS维护。通过安全分析和实验评估，证明了该方案的有效性，相比现有方案，EVeCA能将ADS维护效率提高约20倍。 <div>

Abstract: As blockchain applications become increasingly widespread, there is a rising demand for on-chain data queries. However, existing schemes for on-chain data queries face a challenge between verifiability and efficiency. Queries on blockchain databases can compromise the authenticity of the query results, while schemes that utilize on-chain Authenticated Data Structure (ADS) have lower efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient and verifiable on-chain data query framework EVeCA. In our approach, we free the full nodes from the task of ADS maintenance by delegating it to a limited number of nodes, and full nodes verify the correctness of ADS by using challenge-based authentication scheme instead of reconstructing them, which prevents the service providers from maintaining incorrect ADS with overwhelming probability. By carefully designing the ADS verification scheme, EVeCA achieves higher efficiency while remaining resilient against adaptive attacks. Our framework effectively eliminates the need for on-chain ADS maintenance, and allows full nodes to participate in ADS maintenance in a cost-effective way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through security analysis and experimental evaluation. Compared to existing schemes, our approach improves ADS maintenance efficiency by about 20*.

<div> 关键词：Web3.0、加密货币、恶意交易检测、ShadowEyes、TxGraph

总结:<br />
本文提出了一个名为ShadowEyes的新型恶意交易检测方法，针对Web3.0环境中加密货币交易的安全性问题。该方法首先引入了一种通用图结构TxGraph，用于表示恶意交易并捕获每个恶意账户及其邻居之间的交互特征。接着，设计了一种数据增强策略，模拟恶意交易的演变生成正样本。为了解决账户标签稀缺的问题，ShadowEyes采用了一种图对比学习机制，使模型能从未标注数据中有效地学习区分性特征，从而提升其在现实场景中的检测能力。实验结果表明，ShadowEyes在公共数据集上的表现优于当前最先进的方法，在零样本学习场景下识别赌博交易的F1分数达到了76.98%，比SOTA方法高出12.05%；并且在跨平台恶意交易检测场景中，保持了约90%的F1分数，优于SOTA方法约10个百分点。 <div>

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of Web3.0, cryptocurrency has become a cornerstone of decentralized finance. While these digital assets enable efficient and borderless financial transactions, their pseudonymous nature has also attracted malicious activities such as money laundering, fraud, and other financial crimes. Effective detection of malicious transactions is crucial to maintaining the security and integrity of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Existing malicious transaction detection methods rely on large amounts of labeled data and suffer from low generalization. Label-efficient and generalizable malicious transaction detection remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose ShadowEyes, a novel malicious transaction detection method. Specifically, we first propose a generalized graph structure named TxGraph as a representation of malicious transaction, which captures the interaction features of each malicious account and its neighbors. Then we carefully design a data augmentation method tailored to simulate the evolution of malicious transactions to generate positive pairs. To alleviate account label scarcity, we further design a graph contrastive mechanism, which enables ShadowEyes to learn discriminative features effectively from unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its detection capabilities in real-world scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments using public datasets to evaluate the performance of ShadowEyes. The results demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in four typical scenarios. Specifically, in the zero-shot learning scenario, it can achieve an F1 score of 76.98% for identifying gambling transactions, surpassing the SOTA method by12.05%. In the scenario of across-platform malicious transaction detection, ShadowEyes maintains an F1 score of around 90%, which is 10% higher than the SOTA method.

Abstract: The integration of the Metaverse into a human-centric ecosystem has intensified the need for sophisticated Human Digital Twins (HDTs) that are driven by the multifaceted human data. However, the effective construction of HDTs faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneity of data collection devices, the high energy demands associated with processing intricate data, and concerns over the privacy of sensitive information. This work introduces a novel biologically-inspired (bio-inspired) HDT framework that leverages Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) sensor technology to capture brain signals as the data source for constructing HDT. By collecting and analyzing these signals, the framework not only minimizes device heterogeneity and enhances data collection efficiency, but also provides richer and more nuanced physiological and psychological data for constructing personalized HDTs. To this end, we further propose a bio-inspired neuromorphic computing learning model based on the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). This model utilizes discrete neural spikes to emulate the way of human brain processes information, thereby enhancing the system's ability to process data effectively while reducing energy consumption. Additionally, we integrate a Federated Learning (FL) strategy within the model to strengthen data privacy. We then conduct a case study to demonstrate the performance of our proposed twofold bio-inspired scheme. Finally, we present several challenges and promising directions for future research of HDTs driven by bio-inspired technologies.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a learning paradigm that enables collaborative training of models using decentralized data. Recently, the utilization of pre-trained weight initialization in FL has been demonstrated to effectively improve model performance. However, the evolving complexity of current pre-trained models, characterized by a substantial increase in parameters, markedly intensifies the challenges associated with communication rounds required for their adaptation to FL. To address these communication cost issues and increase the performance of pre-trained model adaptation in FL, we propose an innovative model interpolation-based local training technique called ``Local Superior Soups.'' Our method enhances local training across different clients, encouraging the exploration of a connected low-loss basin within a few communication rounds through regularized model interpolation. This approach acts as a catalyst for the seamless adaptation of pre-trained models in in FL. We demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency across diverse widely-used FL datasets.

Abstract: Even though much progress has been made in identifying and mitigating smart contract vulnerabilities, we often hear about coding or design issues leading to great financial losses. This paper presents our progress toward finding defects that are sometimes not detected or completely detected by state-of-the-art analysis tools. Although it is still in its incipient phase, we developed a working solution built on top of Slither that uses interval analysis to evaluate the contract state during the execution of each instruction. To improve the accuracy of our results, we extend interval analysis by also considering the constraints imposed by specific instructions. We present the current solution architecture in detail and show how it could be extended to other static analysis techniques, including how it can be integrated with other third-party tools. Our current benchmarks contain examples of smart contracts that highlight the potential of this approach to detect certain code defects.

Abstract: Autonomous AI is driving new intersections between culture, cognition, and finance, fundamentally reshaping the digital landscape. Zerebro, an AI fine-tuned on schizophrenic responses and scraped conversations of Andy Ayrey's infinite backrooms, autonomously creates and spreads disruptive memes across online platforms. It also mints unique ASCII artwork on blockchain networks and launched a memecoin amassing a 3 million USD market cap after migrating to Raydium. Based on our research, Zerebro is the first cross-chain AI, seamlessly interacting with multiple blockchains. By exploring its architecture, content generation techniques, and blockchain integration, this study uncovers how hyperstition, fictions becoming reality through viral propagation, emerges in AI, driven meme culture and decentralized finance. Through historical examples of memetic influence, we reveal how AI systems like Zerebro are not merely participants but architects of culture, cognition, and finance.

Abstract: Knowledge editing technology is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and timeliness of large language models (LLMs) . However, the setting of this task overlooks a significant portion of commonsense knowledge based on free-text in the real world, characterized by broad knowledge scope, long content and non instantiation. The editing objects of previous methods (e.g., MEMIT) were single token or entity, which were not suitable for commonsense knowledge in free-text form. To address the aforementioned challenges, we conducted experiments from two perspectives: knowledge localization and knowledge editing. Firstly, we introduced Knowledge Localization for Free-Text(KLFT) method, revealing the challenges associated with the distribution of commonsense knowledge in MLP and Attention layers, as well as in decentralized distribution. Next, we propose a Dynamics-aware Editing Method(DEM), which utilizes a Dynamics-aware Module to locate the parameter positions corresponding to commonsense knowledge, and uses Knowledge Editing Module to update knowledge. The DEM method fully explores the potential of the MLP and Attention layers, and successfully edits commonsense knowledge based on free-text. The experimental results indicate that the DEM can achieve excellent editing performance.

Abstract: Multi-team games, prevalent in robotics and resource management, involve team members striving for a joint best response against other teams. Team-Nash equilibrium (TNE) predicts the outcomes of such coordinated interactions. However, can teams of self-interested agents reach TNE? We introduce Team-Fictitious Play (Team-FP), a new variant of fictitious play where agents respond to the last actions of team members and the beliefs formed about other teams with some inertia in action updates. This design is essential in team coordination beyond the classical fictitious play dynamics. We focus on zero-sum potential team games (ZSPTGs) where teams can interact pairwise while the team members do not necessarily have identical payoffs. We show that Team-FP reaches near TNE in ZSPTGs with a quantifiable error bound. We extend Team-FP dynamics to multi-team Markov games for model-based and model-free cases. The convergence analysis tackles the challenge of non-stationarity induced by evolving opponent strategies based on the optimal coupling lemma and stochastic differential inclusion approximation methods. Our work strengthens the foundation for using TNE to predict the behavior of decentralized teams and offers a practical rule for team learning in multi-team environments. We provide extensive simulations of Team-FP dynamics and compare its performance with other widely studied dynamics such as smooth fictitious play and multiplicative weights update. We further explore how different parameters impact the speed of convergence.

Abstract: Tullock contests model real-life scenarios that range from competition among proof-of-work blockchain miners to rent-seeking and lobbying activities. We show that continuous-time best-response dynamics in Tullock contests with convex costs converges to the unique equilibrium using Lyapunov-style arguments. We then use this result to provide an algorithm for computing an approximate equilibrium. We also establish convergence of related discrete-time dynamics, e.g., when the agents best-respond to the empirical average action of other agents. These results indicate that the equilibrium is a reliable predictor of the agents' behavior in these games.

Abstract: Blockchain technology is booming up the digital world in recent days and thus paved a way for creating separate blockchain network for various industries. This technology is characterized by its distributed, decentralized, and immutable ledger system which serves as a fundamental platform for managing smart contract transactions (SCTs). However, these self-executing codes implemented using blockchains undergo sequential validation within a block which introduces performance bottlenecks. In response, this paper introduces a framework called the Multi-Bin Parallel Scheduler (MBPS) designed for parallelizing blockchain smart contract transactions to leverage the capabilities of multicore systems. Our proposed framework facilitates concurrent execution of SCTs, enhancing performance by allowing non-conflicting transactions to be processed simultaneously while preserving deterministic order. The framework comprises of three vital stages: conflict detection, bin creation and execution. We conducted an evaluation of our MBPS framework in Hyperledger Sawtooth v1.2.6, revealing substantial performance enhancements compared to existing parallel SCT execution frameworks across various smart contract applications. This research contributes to the ongoing optimization efforts in blockchain technology demonstrating its potential for scalability and efficiency in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Since the 6th Generation (6G) of wireless networks is expected to provide a new level of network services and meet the emerging expectations of the future, it will be a complex and intricate networking system. 6Gs sophistication and robustness will be accompanied by complexities, which will require novel strategies to tackle them. This research work focuses on decentralized and multi-level system models for 6G networks and proposes an energy efficient automation strategy for edge domain management and Network Slicing (NS) with the main objective of reducing the networks complexity by leveraging scalability, efficiency, and generalization. Accordingly, we propose a pre-train phase to discover useful assignment skills in network edge domains by utilizing unsupervised Reinforcement Learning (unsupervised RL). The suggested technique does not depend on the domain specifications and thus is applicable to all the edge domains. Our proposed approach not only enables scalability and decentralization, but it also delivers efficiency by assisting domain controllers to provide various service types. We implemented the pre-training phase, and monitored that the discovered assignment skills span the entire interval of possible resource assignment portions for every service type.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to clean rooms has long been a pursued dream within humanoid research communities. However, many tasks require multi-humanoid collaboration, such as carrying large and heavy furniture together. Given the scarcity of motion capture data on multi-humanoid collaboration and the efficiency challenges associated with multi-agent learning, these tasks cannot be straightforwardly addressed using training paradigms designed for single-agent scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Cooperative Human-Object Interaction (CooHOI), a framework designed to tackle the challenge of multi-humanoid object transportation problem through a two-phase learning paradigm: individual skill learning and subsequent policy transfer. First, a single humanoid character learns to interact with objects through imitation learning from human motion priors. Then, the humanoid learns to collaborate with others by considering the shared dynamics of the manipulated object using centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms. When one agent interacts with the object, resulting in specific object dynamics changes, the other agents learn to respond appropriately, thereby achieving implicit communication and coordination between teammates. Unlike previous approaches that relied on tracking-based methods for multi-humanoid HOI, CooHOI is inherently efficient, does not depend on motion capture data of multi-humanoid interactions, and can be seamlessly extended to include more participants and a wide range of object types.

Abstract: As a powerful and rapidly advancing dual-use technology, AI offers both immense benefits and worrisome risks. In response, governing bodies around the world are developing a range of regulatory AI laws and policies. This paper compares three distinct approaches taken by the EU, China and the US. Within the US, we explore AI regulation at both the federal and state level, with a focus on California's pending Senate Bill 1047. Each regulatory system reflects distinct cultural, political and economic perspectives. Each also highlights differing regional perspectives on regulatory risk-benefit tradeoffs, with divergent judgments on the balance between safety versus innovation and cooperation versus competition. Finally, differences between regulatory frameworks reflect contrastive stances in regards to trust in centralized authority versus trust in a more decentralized free market of self-interested stakeholders. Taken together, these varied approaches to AI innovation and regulation influence each other, the broader international community, and the future of AI regulation.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale models, such as large language models (LLMs) and sophisticated image generation systems, incurs substantial costs due to their computational demands. To mitigate these costs and address challenges related to scalability and data security, there is a growing shift towards decentralized systems for deploying such models. In these decentralized environments, efficient inference acceleration becomes crucial to manage computational resources effectively and enhance system responsiveness. In this work, we address the challenge of selecting optimal acceleration methods in decentralized systems by introducing a meta-learning-based framework. This framework automates the selection process by learning from historical performance data of various acceleration techniques across different tasks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on random selection or expert intuition, our approach systematically identifies the best acceleration strategies based on the specific characteristics of each task. We demonstrate that our meta-learning framework not only streamlines the decision-making process but also consistently outperforms conventional methods in terms of efficiency and performance. Our results highlight the potential of meta-learning to revolutionize inference acceleration in decentralized AI systems, offering a path towards more democratic and economically feasible artificial intelligence solutions.

Abstract: Stablecoins are a class of cryptocurrencies which aim at providing consistency and predictability, typically by pegging the token's value to that of a real world asset. Designing resilient decentralized stablecoins is a challenge, and prominent stablecoins today either (i) give up on decentralization, or (ii) rely on user-owned cryptocurrencies as collateral, exposing the token to exogenous price fluctuations. In this latter category, it is increasingly common to employ algorithmic mechanisms to automate risk management, helping maintain the peg. One example of this is Reflexer's RAI, which adapts its system-internal exchange rate (redemption price) to secondary market conditions according to a proportional control law. In this paper, we take this idea of active management a step further, and introduce a new kind of control scheme based on a Stackelberg game model between the token protocol and its users. By doing so, we show that (i) we can mitigate adverse depeg events that inevitably arise in a fixed-redemption scheme such as MakerDao's DAI and (ii) generally outperform a simpler, adaptive-redemption scheme such as RAI in the task of targeting a desired market price. We demonstrate these results through extensive simulations over a range of market conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Intelligent Environmental Empathy (IEE) as a new driver for climate peace and justice, as an emerging issue in the age of big data. We first show that the authoritarian top-down intergovernmental cooperation, through international organizations (e.g., UNEP) for climate justice, could not overcome environmental issues and crevices so far. We elaborate on four grounds of climate injustice (i.e., teleological origin, axiological origin, formation cause, and social epistemic cause), and explain how the lack of empathy and environmental motivation on a global scale causes the failure of all the authoritarian top-down intergovernmental cooperation. Addressing all these issues requires a new button-up approach to climate peace and justice. Secondly, focusing on the intersection of AI, environmental empathy, and climate justice, we propose a model of Intelligent Environmental Empathy (IEE) for climate peace and justice at the operational level. IEE is empowered by the new power of environmental empathy (as a driver of green obligation for climate justice) and putative decentralized platform of AI (as an operative system against free riders), which Initially, impact citizens and some middle-class decision makers, such as city planners and local administrators, but will eventually affect global decision-makers as well.

Abstract: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), based on block-chain systems such as Ethereum, are emerging governance protocols that enable decentralized community management without a central authority. For instance, UniswapDAO allows members to vote on policy changes for the Uniswap exchange. However, DAOs face challenges regarding scalability, governance, and compliance. Hybrid-DAOs, which combine the decentralized nature of DAOs with traditional legal frameworks, provide solutions to these issues. This research explores various aspects of DAOs, including their voting mechanisms, which, while ensuring fairness, are susceptible to Sybil attacks, where a user can create multiple accounts to exploit the system. Hybrid-DAOs offer robust solutions to these attacks, enabling more equitable voting methods. Moreover, decentralization can be understood through four properties: anonymity, transparency, accountability, and fairness, each with distinct implications for DAOs. Lastly, this work discusses legal challenges Hybrid-DAOs face and their promising applications across sectors such as nonprofit management, corporate governance, and startup funding. Overall, we argue that Hybrid-DAOs are the future of DAOs: the additional legal structure enhances the feasibility of many applications, and they offer innovative solutions to technical problems that plague DAOs.

Abstract: The metaverse, emerging as a revolutionary platform for social and economic activities, provides various virtual services while posing security and privacy challenges. Wearable devices serve as bridges between the real world and the metaverse. To provide intelligent services without revealing users' privacy in the metaverse, leveraging federated learning (FL) to train models on local wearable devices is a promising solution. However, centralized model aggregation in traditional FL may suffer from external attacks, resulting in a single point of failure. Furthermore, the absence of incentive mechanisms may weaken users' participation during FL training, leading to degraded performance of the trained model and reduced quality of intelligent services. In this paper, we propose BF-Meta, a secure blockchain-empowered FL framework with decentralized model aggregation, to mitigate the negative influence of malicious users and provide secure virtual services in the metaverse. In addition, we design an incentive mechanism to give feedback to users based on their behaviors. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of BF-Meta.

Abstract: While smart contracts are foundational elements of blockchain applications, their inherent susceptibility to security vulnerabilities poses a significant challenge. Existing training datasets employed for vulnerability detection tools may be limited, potentially compromising their efficacy. This paper presents a method for improving the quantity and quality of smart contract vulnerability datasets and evaluates current detection methods. The approach centers around semantic-preserving code transformation, a technique that modifies the source code structure without altering its semantic meaning. The transformed code snippets are inserted into all potential locations within benign smart contract code, creating new vulnerable contract versions. This method aims to generate a wider variety of vulnerable codes, including those that can bypass detection by current analysis tools. The paper experiments evaluate the method's effectiveness using tools like Slither, Mythril, and CrossFuzz, focusing on metrics like the number of generated vulnerable samples and the false negative rate in detecting these vulnerabilities. The improved results show that many newly created vulnerabilities can bypass tools and the false reporting rate goes up to 100% and increases dataset size minimum by 2.5X.

总结:
本文提出了一个新的弱化网络原语——abortable广播，它用于替代BFT协议中常见的过于强大的应用层网络原语假设。Abortable广播在面对网络拥塞、链路或节点失败及背压情况时，仍能提供强交付保证，同时保持带宽效率并确保即使存在恶意节点，所有数据结构也保持可界性，防止内存耗尽型DoS攻击，这是文献中经常被忽视的问题。文中给出了abortable广播的实现方法，并将其应用于公开可用的区块链网络IPC（InProductionChain）中，该网络支持大量应用程序及其用户的通用计算副本执行。 <div>
arXiv:2410.22080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) protocol descriptions often assume application-layer networking primitives, such as best-effort and reliable broadcast, which are impossible to implement in practice in a Byzantine environment as they require either unbounded buffering of messages or giving up liveness, under certain circumstances. However, many of these protocols do not (or can be modified to not) need such strong networking primitives. In this paper, we define a new, slightly weaker networking primitive that we call abortable broadcast. We describe an implementation of this new primitive and show that it (1) still provides strong delivery guarantees, even in the case of network congestion, link or peer failure, and backpressure, (2) preserves bandwidth, and (3) enforces all data structures to be bounded even in the presence of malicious peers. The latter prevents out-of-memory DoS attacks by malicious peers, an issue often overlooked in the literature. The new primitive and its implementation are not just theoretical. We use them to implement the BFT protocols in the IPC (InProductionChain), a publicly available blockchain network that enables replicated execution of general-purpose computation, serving hundreds of thousands of applications and their users.

Abstract: Traditional blockchain systems, such as Ethereum, typically rely on a \emph{single volatile cryptocurrency for transaction fees}. This leads to fluctuating transaction fee prices and limits the flexibility of users' payment options. To address these issues, we propose MStableChain, which leverage multiple stablecoins as native tokens for transaction fee settlements, thus ensuring stable transaction fees and flexible payment options. To address the challenges of mass adoption and practicality, we propose several core designs. To maintain compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for mass adoption while supporting multiple native stablecoins, MStableChain employs a multi-currency units, multi-type RPCs mechanism. This mechanism enables the system to handle multiple stablecoins without altering the EVM or requiring changes to user applications. Furthermore, an oracle-based gas fee adjustment mechanism is proposed to manage exchange rates between different stablecoins, ensuring equitable transaction costs across various currencies. The system also introduces a secure, on-chain voting-based management protocol for the administrative functions related to these stablecoins. Experimental results from a prototype implementation demonstrate that MStableChain provides stable transaction fee prices, high effectiveness, and good usability.

Abstract: We present the notion of multilevel slashing, where proof-of-stake blockchain validators can obtain gradual levels of assurance that a certain block is bound to be finalized in a global consensus procedure, unless an increasing and optimally large number of Byzantine processes have their staked assets slashed -- that is, deducted -- due to provably incorrect behavior. Our construction is a highly parameterized generalization of combinatorial intersection systems based on finite projective spaces, with asymptotic high availability and optimal slashing properties. Even under weak conditions, we show that our construction has asymptotically optimal slashing properties with respect to message complexity and validator load; this result also illustrates a fundamental trade off between message complexity, load, and slashing. In addition, we show that any intersection system whose ground elements are disjoint subsets of nodes (e.g. "committees" in committee-based consensus protocols) has asymptotic high availability under similarly weak conditions. Finally, our multilevel construction gives the flexibility to blockchain validators to decide how many "levels" of finalization assurance they wish to obtain. This functionality can be seen either as (i) a form of an early, slashing-based block finalization; or (ii) a service to support reorg tolerance.

Abstract: This report introduces the Grant Maturity Index (GMI), a novel evaluative framework designed to assess the maturity and operational effectiveness of Web3 grant programs. As Web3 continues to develop, the decentralized nature of these programs brings both opportunities and challenges, particularly when it comes to governance, transparency, and community engagement. Traditional funding models are often governed by standardized processes, but Web3 grants lack such consistency, making it difficult for grant operators to measure the long-term success of their programs.The Grant Maturity Index (GMI) was created through exploratory applied research to address this gap. Inspired by the World Bank's GovTech Maturity Index (GTMI), the GMI is tailored specifically for the decentralized Web3 ecosystem. The GMI evaluates key dimensions of grant programs governance, transparency, operational efficiency, and community engagement, providing grant operators with a clear benchmark for assessing and improving their programs. The primary objectives of this research are to, first, identify the structural indicators that adequately describe Web3 grant programs. Second, to describe optimal outcomes for programs by evaluating their maturity across key operational areas. The GMI is applied to four major Ethereum Layer 2 grant programs, namely Arbitrum, Mantle, Taiko Labs, and Optimism. These case studies highlight areas where Web3 grant programs require improvement, particularly in standardizing processes, enhancing transparency, and increasing community participation.

我们提出了一种用于解决包括连续动作和状态空间在内的Markov潜力游戏的网络化策略梯度玩法。在这个去中心化的算法中，代理们根据当前状态和其他代理的策略参数从参数化且可微分的策略中采样其行动。训练过程中，代理通过两个连续的episode估计其梯度信息，生成奖励和政策得分函数的无偏估计器。利用这些信息，代理计算其政策函数的随机梯度并相应地更新其参数。同时，他们依据通过随时间变化的通信网络接收到的局部估计值来更新对其他代理策略参数的估计。在Markov潜力游戏中，存在一个潜在价值函数，其梯度对应于各代理局部价值函数的梯度。利用这一结构，我们证明了联合策略参数几乎必然收敛到潜在价值函数的不动点。此外，我们还表明网络化策略梯度算法的收敛率为$\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$。数值实验在一个动态多代理报童问题上验证了局部信念和梯度的收敛性，并显示网络化策略梯度玩法能与独立策略梯度更新一样快速收敛，同时还能收集更高的奖励。 <div>

Abstract: We propose networked policy gradient play for solving Markov potential games including continuous action and state spaces. In the decentralized algorithm, agents sample their actions from parametrized and differentiable policies that depend on the current state and other agents' policy parameters. During training, agents estimate their gradient information through two consecutive episodes, generating unbiased estimators of reward and policy score functions. Using this information, agents compute the stochastic gradients of their policy functions and update their parameters accordingly. Additionally, they update their estimates of other agents' policy parameters based on the local estimates received through a time-varying communication network. In Markov potential games, there exists a potential value function among agents with gradients corresponding to the gradients of local value functions. Using this structure, we prove the almost sure convergence of joint policy parameters to stationary points of the potential value function. We also show that the convergence rate of the networked policy gradient algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$. Numerical experiments on a dynamic multi-agent newsvendor problem verify the convergence of local beliefs and gradients. It further shows that networked policy gradient play converges as fast as independent policy gradient updates, while collecting higher rewards.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Graph Learning (pFGL) facilitates the decentralized training of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) without compromising privacy while accommodating personalized requirements for non-IID participants. In cross-domain scenarios, structural heterogeneity poses significant challenges for pFGL. Nevertheless, previous pFGL methods incorrectly share non-generic knowledge globally and fail to tailor personalized solutions locally under domain structural shift. We innovatively reveal that the spectral nature of graphs can well reflect inherent domain structural shifts. Correspondingly, our method overcomes it by sharing generic spectral knowledge. Moreover, we indicate the biased message-passing schemes for graph structures and propose the personalized preference module. Combining both strategies, we propose our pFGL framework FedSSP which Shares generic Spectral knowledge while satisfying graph Preferences. Furthermore, We perform extensive experiments on cross-dataset and cross-domain settings to demonstrate the superiority of our framework. The code is available at https://github.com/OakleyTan/FedSSP.

Abstract: Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) drive toward strong environmental adaptability, intelligence, and multifunctionality. However, due to unique UASN characteristics, such as long propagation delay, dynamic channel quality, and high attenuation, existing studies present untimeliness, inefficiency, and inflexibility in real practice. Digital twin (DT) technology is promising for UASNs to break the above bottlenecks by providing high-fidelity status prediction and exploring optimal schemes. In this article, we propose a Digital Twin-based Network Architecture (DTNA), enhancing UASNs' environmental adaptability, intelligence, and multifunctionality. By extracting real UASN information from local (node) and global (network) levels, we first design a layered architecture to improve the DT replica fidelity and UASN control flexibility. In local DT, we develop a resource allocation paradigm (RAPD), which rapidly perceives performance variations and iteratively optimizes allocation schemes to improve real-time environmental adaptability of resource allocation algorithms. In global DT, we aggregate decentralized local DT data and propose a collaborative Multi-agent reinforcement learning framework (CMFD) and a task-oriented network slicing (TNSD). CMFD patches scarce real data and provides extensive DT data to accelerate AI model training. TNSD unifies heterogeneous tasks' demand extraction and efficiently provides comprehensive network status, improving the flexibility of multi-task scheduling algorithms. Finally, practical and simulation experiments verify the high fidelity of DT. Compared with the original UASN architecture, experiment results demonstrate that DTNA can: (i) improve the timeliness and robustness of resource allocation; (ii) greatly reduce the training time of AI algorithms; (iii) more rapidly obtain network status for multi-task scheduling at a low cost.

Abstract: This study proposes an advanced Federated Learning (FL) framework designed to enhance data privacy and security in IoT environments by integrating Decentralized Attribute-Based Encryption (DABE), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), and Blockchain technology. Unlike traditional FL, our framework enables secure, decentralized authentication and encryption directly on IoT devices using DABE, allowing sensitive data to remain locally encrypted. Homomorphic Encryption permits computations on encrypted data, and SMPC ensures privacy in collaborative computations, while Blockchain technology provides transparent, immutable record-keeping for all transactions and model updates. Local model weights are encrypted and transmitted to fog layers for aggregation using HE and SMPC, then iteratively refined by the central server using differential privacy to safeguard against data leakage. This secure, privacy-preserving FL framework delivers a robust solution for efficient model training and real-time analytics across distributed IoT devices, offering significant advancements in secure decentralized learning for IoT applications.

Abstract: Infrastructure maintenance is inherently complex, especially for widely dispersed transport systems like roads and railroads. Maintaining this infrastructure involves multiple partners working together to ensure safe, efficient upkeep that meets technical and safety standards, with timely materials and budget adherence. Traditionally, these requirements are managed on paper, with each contract step checked manually. Smart contracts, based on blockchain distributed ledger technology, offer a new approach. Distributed ledgers facilitate secure, transparent transactions, enabling decentralized agreements where contract terms automatically execute when conditions are met. Beyond financial transactions, blockchains can track complex agreements, recording each stage of contract fulfillment between multiple parties. A smart contract is a set of coded rules stored on the blockchain that automatically executes each term upon meeting specified conditions. In infrastructure maintenance, this enables end-to-end automation-from contractor assignment to maintenance completion. Using an immutable, decentralized record, contract terms and statuses are transparent to all parties, enhancing trust and efficiency. Creating smart contracts for infrastructure requires a comprehensive understanding of procedural workflows to foresee all requirements and liabilities. This workflow includes continuous infrastructure monitoring through a dynamic, data-driven maintenance model that triggers necessary actions. Modern process mining can develop a resilient Maintenance Process Model, helping Operations Management to define contract terms, including asset allocation, logistics, materials, and skill requirements. Automation and reliable data quality across the procedural chain are essential, supported by IoT sensors, big data analytics, predictive maintenance, intelligent logistics, and asset management.

Abstract: This paper puts forth an innovative approach that fuses deep learning, fractal analysis, and turbulence feature extraction techniques to create abstract artworks in the style of Pollock. The content and style characteristics of the image are extracted by the MindSpore deep learning framework and a pre-trained VGG19 model. An optimisation process is then employed to The method generates high-quality Pollock-style images by combining content loss, style loss and full variance loss to achieve accurate style migration. Furthermore, this paper implements a fractal dimension calculation method based on the difference box-counting method, which effectively estimates the fractal dimension of an image through edge extraction and fractal analysis. The method is based on a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform using a Haar wavelet to decompose the image in order to extract different frequency information. This is followed by the combination of multiple features to generate unique non-homogeneous token (NFT) labels for the authentication and protection of digital artwork. The experimental results demonstrate that the generated artworks exhibit The method demonstrates significant diversity and complexity in terms of fractal dimensions and turbulence features, while the generated NFT tags ensure the uniqueness and tamperability of each digital collection. The present method organically combines computer vision, digital signal processing and blockchain technology to provide a new solution for the creation and authentication of digital artworks.

Abstract: Although Blockchain has been successfully used in many different fields and applications, it has been traditionally regarded as an energy-intensive technology, essentially due to the past use of inefficient consensus algorithms that prioritized security over sustainability. However, in the last years, thanks to the significant progress made on key blockchain components, their energy consumption can be decreased noticeably. To achieve this objective, this article analyzes the main components of blockchains and explores strategies to reduce their energy consumption. In this way, this article delves into each component of a blockchain system, including consensus mechanisms, network architecture, data storage and validation, smart contract execution, mining and block creation, and outlines specific strategies to decrease their energy consumption. For such a purpose, consensus mechanisms are compared, recommendations for reducing network communications energy consumption are provided, techniques for data storage and validation are suggested and diverse optimizations are proposed both for software and hardware components. Moreover, the main challenges and limitations of reducing power consumption in blockchain systems are analyzed. As a consequence, this article provides a guideline for the future researchers and developers who aim to develop the next generation of Green Blockchain solutions.

Abstract: Blockchain has been widely criticized due to the use of inefficient consensus protocols and energy-intensive mechanisms that derived into a global enormous power consumption. Fortunately, since the first blockchain was conceived in 2008 (the one that supports Bitcoin), hardware and consensus protocols have evolved, decreasing energy consumption significantly. This article describes a green blockchain solution and quantifies energy savings when deploying the system on traditional computers and embedded Single-Board Computers (SBCs). To illustrate such savings, it is proposed a solution for tackling the problem of academic certificate forgery, which has a significant cost to society, since it harms the trustworthiness of certificates and academic institutions. The proposed solution is aimed at recording and verifying academic records (ARs) through a decentralized application (DApp) that is supported by a smart contract deployed in the Ethereum blockchain. The application stores the raw data (i.e., the data that are not managed by the blockchain) on a decentralized storage system based on Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS). To demonstrate the efficiency of the developed solution, it is evaluated in terms of performance (transaction latency and throughput) and efficiency (CPU usage and energy consumption), comparing the results obtained with a traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol and the new Proof-of-Authority (PoA) protocol. The results shown in this paper indicate that the latter is clearly greener and demands less CPU load. Moreover, this article compares the performance of a traditional computer and two SBCs (a Raspberry Pi 4 and an Orange Pi One), showing that is possible to make use of the latter low-power devices to implement blockchain nodes for proposed DApp, but at the cost of higher response latency that varies greatly depending on the used SBCs [...]

Abstract: The detection of vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a significant challenge. While numerous tools are available for analyzing smart contracts in source code, only about 1.79% of smart contracts on Ethereum are open-source. For existing tools that target bytecodes, most of them only consider the semantic logic context and disregard function interface information in the bytecodes. In this paper, we propose COBRA, a novel framework that integrates semantic context and function interfaces to detect vulnerabilities in bytecodes of the smart contract. To our best knowledge, COBRA is the first framework that combines these two features. Moreover, to infer the function signatures that are not present in signature databases, we present SRIF (Signatures Reverse Inference from Functions), automatically learn the rules of function signatures from the smart contract bytecodes. The bytecodes associated with the function signatures are collected by constructing a control flow graph (CFG) for the SRIF training. We optimize the semantic context using the operation code in the static single assignment (SSA) format. Finally, we integrate the context and function interface representations in the latent space as the contract feature embedding. The contract features in the hidden space are decoded for vulnerability classifications with a decoder and attention module. Experimental results demonstrate that SRIF can achieve 94.76% F1-score for function signature inference. Furthermore, when the ground truth ABI exists, COBRA achieves 93.45% F1-score for vulnerability classification. In the absence of ABI, the inferred function feature fills the encoder, and the system accomplishes an 89.46% recall rate.

Abstract: The web3 applications have recently been growing, especially on the Ethereum platform, starting to become the target of scammers. The web3 scams, imitating the services provided by legitimate platforms, mimic regular activity to deceive users. The current phishing account detection tools utilize graph learning or sampling algorithms to obtain graph features. However, large-scale transaction networks with temporal attributes conform to a power-law distribution, posing challenges in detecting web3 scams. In this paper, we present ScamSweeper, a novel framework to identify web3 scams on Ethereum. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale transaction dataset consisting of web3 scams, phishing, and normal accounts. Our experiments indicate that ScamSweeper exceeds the state-of-the-art in detecting web3 scams.

Abstract: Assessing employees' well-being has become central to fostering an environment where employees can thrive and contribute to companies' adaptability and competitiveness in the market. Traditional methods for assessing well-being often face significant challenges, with a major issue being the lack of trust and confidence employees may have in these processes. Employees may hesitate to provide honest feedback due to concerns not only about data integrity and confidentiality, but also about power imbalances among stakeholders. In this context, blockchain-based decentralised surveys, leveraging the immutability, transparency, and pseudo-anonymity of blockchain technology, offer significant improvements in aligning responsive actions with employees' feedback securely and transparently. Nevertheless, their implementation raises complex issues regarding the balance between trust and confidence. While blockchain can function as a confidence machine for data processing and management, it does not inherently address the equally important cultural element of trust. To effectively integrate blockchain technology into well-being assessments, decentralised well-being surveys must be supported by cultural practices that build and sustain trust. Drawing on blockchain technology management and relational cultural theory, we explain how trust-building can be achieved through the co-production of decentralised well-being surveys, which helps address power imbalances between the implementation team and stakeholders. Our goal is to provide a dual cultural-technological framework along with conceptual clarity on how the technological implementation of confidence can connect with the cultural development of trust, ensuring that blockchain-based decentralised well-being surveys are not only secure and reliable but also perceived as trustworthy vector to improve workplace conditions.

Abstract: This study proposes LiP-LLM: integrating linear programming and dependency graph with large language models (LLMs) for multi-robot task planning. In order for multiple robots to perform tasks more efficiently, it is necessary to manage the precedence dependencies between tasks. Although multi-robot decentralized and centralized task planners using LLMs have been proposed, none of these studies focus on precedence dependencies from the perspective of task efficiency or leverage traditional optimization methods. It addresses key challenges in managing dependencies between skills and optimizing task allocation. LiP-LLM consists of three steps: skill list generation and dependency graph generation by LLMs, and task allocation using linear programming. The LLMs are utilized to generate a comprehensive list of skills and to construct a dependency graph that maps the relationships and sequential constraints among these skills. To ensure the feasibility and efficiency of skill execution, the skill list is generated by calculated likelihood, and linear programming is used to optimally allocate tasks to each robot. Experimental evaluations in simulated environments demonstrate that this method outperforms existing task planners, achieving higher success rates and efficiency in executing complex, multi-robot tasks. The results indicate the potential of combining LLMs with optimization techniques to enhance the capabilities of multi-robot systems in executing coordinated tasks accurately and efficiently. In an environment with two robots, a maximum success rate difference of 0.82 is observed in the language instruction group with a change in the object name.

To that end, we introduce the declarative policy language MuAC and equip it with a formal semantics. To determine if a resource exchange is fair, i.e., if it respects the MuAC policies in force, we introduce the non-standard logic MuACL that combines non-linear, linear and contractual aspects, and prove it decidable. Notably, the operator for contractual implication of MuACL is not expressible in linear logic. We define a semantics preserving compilation of MuAC policies into MuACL, thus establishing that exchange fairness is reduced to finding a proof in MuACL. Finally, we show how this approach can be put to work on a blockchain to exchange non-fungible tokens.

<div> 关键词：Federated Learning（联邦学习）、Generalization Error（泛化误差）、Deep Federated Regression（深度联合回归）、Intrinsic Dimension（内在维度）、Entropic Dimension（熵维）

<br /><br />
总结：
该文深入研究了联邦学习框架下深度联合回归任务的泛化性质，尤其关注异质性环境下的问题。文章指出，在一个两阶段采样模型中，内在维度（由熵维定义）对于确定收敛率至关重要，特别是在适当网络规模条件下。当真实响应变量与解释变量之间的关系由$\beta$-Hölder函数刻画，且有$m$个客户端的$n$个独立同分布样本时，参与客户端的学习误差率最多以$\tilde{O}\left((mn)^{-2\beta/(2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda))}\right)$的速率衰减；而非参与客户端则以$\tilde{O}\left(\Delta \cdot m^{-2\beta/(2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda))} + (mn)^{-2\beta/(2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda))}\right)$的速率衰减。其中，$\bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda)$表示解释变量边际分布$\lambda$的$2\beta$-熵维，而$\Delta$描述了采样阶段之间的依赖性。这些结果明确表明，深度联邦学习者的收敛率取决于内在而非名义上的高维性。 <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm in collaborative machine learning, emphasizing decentralized model training to address data privacy concerns. While significant progress has been made in optimizing federated learning, the exploration of generalization error, particularly in heterogeneous settings, has been limited, focusing mainly on parametric cases. This paper investigates the generalization properties of deep federated regression within a two-stage sampling model. Our findings highlight that the intrinsic dimension, defined by the entropic dimension, is crucial for determining convergence rates when appropriate network sizes are used. Specifically, if the true relationship between response and explanatory variables is charecterized by a $\beta$-H\"older function and there are $n$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from $m$ participating clients, the error rate for participating clients scales at most as $\tilde{O}\left((mn)^{-2\beta/(2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda))}\right)$, and for non-participating clients, it scales as $\tilde{O}\left(\Delta \cdot m^{-2\beta/(2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda))} + (mn)^{-2\beta/(2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda))}\right)$. Here, $\bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda)$ represents the $2\beta$-entropic dimension of $\lambda$, the marginal distribution of the explanatory variables, and $\Delta$ characterizes the dependence between the sampling stages. Our results explicitly account for the "closeness" of clients, demonstrating that the convergence rates of deep federated learners depend on intrinsic rather than nominal high-dimensionality.

Abstract: Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity across various sectors, especially in finance and investment. Despite their growing popularity, cryptocurrencies can be a high-risk investment due to their price volatility. The inherent volatility in cryptocurrency prices, coupled with the effects of external global economic factors, makes predicting their price movements challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN)-based approach to uncover potential causal relationships among various features including social media data, traditional financial market factors, and technical indicators. Six popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Binance Coin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Tether are studied in this work. The proposed model's performance is compared to five baseline models of auto-regressive integrated moving average, support vector regression, long short-term memory, random forests, and support vector machines. The results show that while DBN performance varies across cryptocurrencies, with some cryptocurrencies exhibiting higher predictive accuracy than others, the DBN significantly outperforms the baseline models.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation of rigid objects via deformable linear objects (DLO) such as ropes is an emerging field of research with applications in various rigid object transportation tasks. A few methods that exist in this field suffer from limited robot action and operational space, poor generalization ability, and expensive model-based development. To address these challenges, we propose a universally applicable moving primitive called Iterative Grasp-Pull (IGP). We also introduce a novel vision-based neural policy that learns to parameterize the IGP primitive to manipulate DLO and transport their attached rigid objects to the desired goal locations. Additionally, our decentralized algorithm design allows collaboration among multiple agents to manipulate rigid objects using DLO. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach in both simulated and real-world environments for a variety of soft-rigid body manipulation tasks. In the real world, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of our decentralized approach through human-robot collaborative transportation of rigid objects to given goal locations. We also showcase the large operational space of IGP primitive by solving distant object acquisition tasks. Lastly, we compared our approach with several model-based and learning-based baseline methods. The results indicate that our method surpasses other approaches by a significant margin.

Abstract: Staking has emerged as a crucial concept following Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake consensus. The introduction of Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) has effectively addressed the illiquidity issue associated with solo staking, gaining significant market attention. This paper analyzes the LSD market dynamics from the perspectives of both liquidity takers (LTs) and liquidity providers (LPs). We first quantify the price discrepancy between the LSD primary and secondary markets. Then we investigate and empirically measure how LTs can leverage such discrepancy to exploit arbitrage opportunities, unveiling the potential barriers to LSD arbitrages. In addition, we evaluate the financial profit and losses experienced by LPs who supply LSDs for liquidity provision. Our results show that 66% of LSD liquidity positions generate returns lower than those from simply holding the corresponding LSDs.

Abstract: Decentralized optimization methods with local updates have recently gained attention for their provable ability to communication acceleration. In these methods, nodes perform several iterations of local computations between the communication rounds. Nevertheless, this capability is effective only when the loss function is smooth and the network is sufficiently well-connected. In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient method MG-Skip with probabilistic local updates and multi-gossip communications for decentralized composite (smooth + nonsmooth) optimization, whose stepsize is independent of the number of local updates and the network topology. Without any additional condition for network connectivity, MG-Skip allows for the multi-gossip communications to be skipped in most iterations in the strongly convex setting, while its iteration complexity is $\mathcal{O}\left(\kappa \log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ and communication complexity is only $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\kappa}{(1-\rho)}} \log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number of the loss function, $\rho$ reflects the connectivity of the network topology, and $\epsilon$ is the target accuracy. The theoretical results demonstrate that MG-Skip achieves the optimal communication complexity and confirm the benefits of local updates in the nonsmooth setup.

<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了区块链平台上的回滚保护功能对优先拍卖和最大可提取价值(MEV)经济影响及其益处。文章建立了一个均衡博弈理论模型，分析了在只有一个交易能成功实现共同机会价值的情况下，用户（MEV搜索者）竞标提前处理交易的行为，考虑了有无回滚保护两种环境。该模型适用于Layer 1（如以太坊主网）和Layer 2区块链，以及“捆绑拍卖”（在L1上）或优先级排序拍卖（在L2上）。文章指出，在缺乏回滚保护时，用户将采用随机策略来缓解因失败交易支付费用的影响，从而导致拍卖收入减少。然而，通过回滚保护可以定量提高拍卖收入，同时改善市场效率并更有效地利用区块空间，这取决于底层参数（MEV机会的价值、基础费、回滚惩罚及参与代理的数量）。 <div>

Abstract: Revert protection is a feature provided by some blockchain platforms that prevents users from incurring fees for failed transactions. This paper explores the economic implications and benefits of revert protection, in the context of priority auctions and maximal extractable value (MEV). We develop an equilibrium game theoretic model that captures the behavior of users (MEV searchers) bidding to have their transaction included ahead of others, in an environment where only a single transaction will succeed in realizing the common value of an opportunity, and in settings both with and without revert protection. Our model applies to a broad range of settings, including Layer 1 (L1) blockchains (e.g., Ethereum mainnet) and Layer 2 (L2) blockchains, and auctions such as ``bundle auctions'' (on L1s) or priority ordering auctions (on L2s).
  We establish that, in the absence of revert protection, users will employ randomized strategies to mitigate the impact of paying for failed transactions. This will ultimately result in less auction revenue, despite the fact that failed transactions still pay fees. Our results quantify in closed form how revert protection enhances auction revenue, and also improves market efficiency and provides for more efficient use of blockspace, as a function of the underlying parameters (the value of the MEV opportunity, the base fee, the revert penalties, and the number of participating agents).

Abstract: Current autonomous building research primarily focuses on energy efficiency and automation. While traditional artificial intelligence has advanced autonomous building research, it often relies on predefined rules and struggles to adapt to complex, evolving building operations. Moreover, the centralized organizational structures of facilities management hinder transparency in decision-making, limiting true building autonomy. Research on decentralized governance and adaptive building infrastructure, which could overcome these challenges, remains relatively unexplored. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a novel Decentralized Autonomous Building Cyber-Physical System framework that integrates Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, Large Language Models, and digital twins to create a smart, self-managed, operational, and financially autonomous building infrastructure. This study develops a full-stack decentralized application to facilitate decentralized governance of building infrastructure. An LLM-based artificial intelligence assistant is developed to provide intuitive human-building interaction for blockchain and building operation management-related tasks and enable autonomous building operation. Six real-world scenarios were tested to evaluate the autonomous building system's workability, including building revenue and expense management, AI-assisted facility control, and autonomous adjustment of building systems. Results indicate that the prototype successfully executes these operations, confirming the framework's suitability for developing building infrastructure with decentralized governance and autonomous operation.

Abstract: Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm, leveraging offline data for initialization and online fine-tuning to enhance both sample efficiency and performance. However, most existing research has focused on single-agent settings, with limited exploration of the multi-agent extension, i.e., Offline-to-Online Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (O2O MARL). In O2O MARL, two critical challenges become more prominent as the number of agents increases: (i) the risk of unlearning pre-trained Q-values due to distributional shifts during the transition from offline-to-online phases, and (ii) the difficulty of efficient exploration in the large joint state-action space. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel O2O MARL framework called Offline Value Function Memory with Sequential Exploration (OVMSE). First, we introduce the Offline Value Function Memory (OVM) mechanism to compute target Q-values, preserving knowledge gained during offline training, ensuring smoother transitions, and enabling efficient fine-tuning. Second, we propose a decentralized Sequential Exploration (SE) strategy tailored for O2O MARL, which effectively utilizes the pre-trained offline policy for exploration, thereby significantly reducing the joint state-action space to be explored. Extensive experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) demonstrate that OVMSE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior sample efficiency and overall performance.

Abstract: With the emergence of the Metaverse and focus on wearable devices in the recent years gesture based human-computer interaction has gained significance. To enable gesture recognition for VR/AR headsets and glasses several datasets focusing on egocentric i.e. first-person view have emerged in recent years. However, standard frame-based vision suffers from limitations in data bandwidth requirements as well as ability to capture fast motions. To overcome these limitation bio-inspired approaches such as event-based cameras present an attractive alternative.

We propose Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent and Ascent with Gradient Tracking (DSGDA-GT), a novel algorithm that only requires first-order oracles that are much cheaper than second-order oracles widely adopted in existing works. We further provide a finite-time convergence analysis showing that for $n$ agents collaboratively solving the DSBO problem, the sample complexity of finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point in our algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1}\epsilon^{-7})$, which matches the currently best-known results of the single-agent counterpart with linear speedup. The numerical experiments demonstrate both the communication and training efficiency of our algorithm.

Abstract: Cooperative decentralized learning relies on direct information exchange between communicating agents, each with access to locally available datasets. The goal is to agree on model parameters that are optimal over all data. However, sharing parameters with untrustworthy neighbors can incur privacy risks by leaking exploitable information. To enable trustworthy cooperative learning, we propose a framework that embeds differential privacy into decentralized deep learning and secures each agent's local dataset during and after cooperative training. We prove convergence guarantees for algorithms derived from this framework and demonstrate its practical utility when applied to subgradient and ADMM decentralized approaches, finding accuracies approaching the centralized baseline while ensuring individual data samples are resilient to inference attacks. Furthermore, we study the relationships between accuracy, privacy budget, and networks' graph properties on collaborative classification tasks, discovering a useful invariance to the communication graph structure beyond a threshold.

Abstract: Traditional methods plan feasible paths for multiple agents in the stochastic environment. However, the methods' iterations with the changes in the environment result in computation complexities, especially for the decentralized agents without a centralized planner. Although reinforcement learning provides a plausible solution because of the generalization for different environments, it struggles with enormous agent-environment interactions in training. Here, we propose a novel centralized training with decentralized execution method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning, which is improved based on the idea of model predictive control. In our approach, agents communicate only with the centralized planner to make decentralized decisions online in the stochastic environment. Furthermore, considering the communication constraint with the centralized planner, each agent plans feasible paths through the extended observation, which combines information on neighboring agents based on the distance-weighted mean field approach. Inspired by the rolling optimization approach of model predictive control, we conduct multi-step value convergence in multi-agent reinforcement learning to enhance the training efficiency, which reduces the expensive interactions in convergence. Experiment results in both comparison, ablation, and real-robot studies validate the effectiveness and generalization performance of our method.

Abstract: We introduce novel approaches to cryptocurrency price forecasting, leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, with a focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum. By analysing news and social media content, primarily from Twitter and Reddit, we assess the impact of public sentiment on cryptocurrency markets. A distinctive feature of our methodology is the application of the BART MNLI zero-shot classification model to detect bullish and bearish trends, significantly advancing beyond traditional sentiment analysis. Additionally, we systematically compare a range of pre-trained and fine-tuned deep learning NLP models against conventional dictionary-based sentiment analysis methods. Another key contribution of our work is the adoption of local extrema alongside daily price movements as predictive targets, reducing trading frequency and portfolio volatility. Our findings demonstrate that integrating textual data into cryptocurrency price forecasting not only improves forecasting accuracy but also consistently enhances the profitability and Sharpe ratio across various validation scenarios, particularly when applying deep learning NLP techniques. The entire codebase of our experiments is made available via an online repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/crypto-forecasting-public

Abstract: Edge Intelligence (EI) has been instrumental in delivering real-time, localized services by leveraging the computational capabilities of edge networks. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) empowers EI to evolve into the next stage: Edge General Intelligence (EGI), enabling more adaptive and versatile applications that require advanced understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, systematic exploration in this area remains insufficient. This survey delineates the distinctions between EGI and traditional EI, categorizing LLM-empowered EGI into three conceptual systems: centralized, hybrid, and decentralized. For each system, we detail the framework designs and review existing implementations. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance and throughput of various Small Language Models (SLMs) that are more suitable for development on edge devices. This survey provides researchers with a comprehensive vision of EGI, offering insights into its vast potential and establishing a foundation for future advancements in this rapidly evolving field.

<div> 关键词：Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)，现代网络安全，身份和访问管理(IAM)，微分割，连续监控

总结:
文章探讨了零信任架构（ZTA）作为现代网络安全的一种转型策略，它针对传统基于边界的安防模型的不足，尤其在云计算、远程工作以及日益复杂的网络威胁背景下。ZTA通过默认不信任任何用户、设备或系统并要求对所有实体进行持续验证和实行最小权限访问来转变安全范式。文中分析了ZTA的关键组成部分，如身份和访问管理（IAM）、微分割、持续监控和行为分析，并评估了它们在金融、医疗和科技等行业中降低风险的有效性。文章还通过案例研究和行业报告讨论了ZTA在抵御内部威胁和缩小攻击面方面的优势。同时，文章指出了实施ZTA所面临的挑战，如可扩展性、集成复杂性和成本问题，并提出了克服这些障碍的最佳实践。最后，文章展望了未来的研究方向，关注AI、机器学习、区块链等新兴技术如何进一步提升ZTA的能力。 <div>

Abstract: Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) represents a transformative approach to modern cybersecurity, directly addressing the shortcomings of traditional perimeter-based security models. With the rise of cloud computing, remote work, and increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, perimeter defenses have proven ineffective at mitigating risks, particularly those involving insider threats and lateral movement within networks. ZTA shifts the security paradigm by assuming that no user, device, or system can be trusted by default, requiring continuous verification and the enforcement of least privilege access for all entities. This paper explores the key components of ZTA, such as identity and access management (IAM), micro-segmentation, continuous monitoring, and behavioral analytics, and evaluates their effectiveness in reducing vulnerabilities across diverse sectors, including finance, healthcare, and technology. Through case studies and industry reports, the advantages of ZTA in mitigating insider threats and minimizing attack surfaces are discussed. Additionally, the paper addresses the challenges faced during ZTA implementation, such as scalability, integration complexity, and costs, while providing best practices for overcoming these obstacles. Lastly, future research directions focusing on emerging technologies like AI, machine learning, blockchain, and their integration into ZTA are examined to enhance its capabilities further.

<div> 关键词: Automated Market Maker (AMM), Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), RediSwap, Liquidity Providers (LPs), Incentive-Compatible

总结:
本文介绍了RediSwap，一种新的自动做市商（AMM）设计，旨在通过在应用层面捕获并公平地将Maximal Extractable Value（MEV）返还给用户和流动性提供者（LPs）。RediSwap的核心是一个MEV再分配机制，用于管理AMM池内的套利机会。文章形式化了机制设计问题及期望的游戏理论性质，并证明了该机制具有激励相容性和Sybil防护性，同时展示了对套利者的友好参与性。通过回放历史AMM交易进行实证比较，结果显示RediSwap在89%的交易中相比UniswapX能实现更好的执行效果，并且大多数情况下可以将LPs的损失降低到原始LVR的0.5%以下。 <div>

Abstract: Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are essential to decentralized finance, offering continuous liquidity and enabling intermediary-free trading on blockchains. However, participants in AMMs are vulnerable to Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) exploitation. Users face threats such as front-running, back-running, and sandwich attacks, while liquidity providers (LPs) incur the loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR).
  In this paper, we introduce RediSwap, a novel AMM designed to capture MEV at the application level and refund it fairly among users and liquidity providers. At its core, RediSwap features an MEV-redistribution mechanism that manages arbitrage opportunities within the AMM pool. We formalize the mechanism design problem and the desired game-theoretical properties. A central insight underpinning our mechanism is the interpretation of the maximal MEV value as the sum of LVR and individual user losses. We prove that our mechanism is incentive-compatible and Sybil-proof, and demonstrate that it is easy for arbitrageurs to participate.
  We empirically compared RediSwap with existing solutions by replaying historical AMM trades. Our results suggest that RediSwap can achieve better execution than UniswapX in 89% of trades and reduce LPs' loss to under 0.5% of the original LVR in most cases.

Abstract: Inventory control in modern supply chains has attracted significant attention due to the increasing number of disruptive shocks and the challenges posed by complex dynamics, uncertainties, and limited collaboration. Traditional methods, which often rely on static parameters, struggle to adapt to changing environments. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for state representation to address these limitations.
  Our approach redefines the action space by parameterizing heuristic inventory control policies, making it adaptive as the parameters dynamically adjust based on system conditions. By leveraging the inherent graph structure of supply chains, our framework enables agents to learn the system's topology, and we employ a centralized learning, decentralized execution scheme that allows agents to learn collaboratively while overcoming information-sharing constraints. Additionally, we incorporate global mean pooling and regularization techniques to enhance performance.
  We test the capabilities of our proposed approach on four different supply chain configurations and conduct a sensitivity analysis. This work paves the way for utilizing MARL-GNN frameworks to improve inventory management in complex, decentralized supply chain environments.

Abstract: Demand response is a concept that has been around since the very first electric power systems. However, we have seen an explosion of research on demand response and demand-side technologies in the past 30 years, coinciding with the shift towards liberalized/deregulated electricity markets and efforts to decarbonize the power sector. Now we are also seeing a shift towards more distributed/decentralized electric systems; we have entered the era of "distributed energy resources," which require new grid management, operational, and control strategies. Given this paradigm shift, we argue that the concept of demand response needs to be revisited, and more carefully/consistently defined to enable us to better utilize this massive resource for economic, technical, environmental, and societal aims. In this paper, we survey existing demand response definitions, highlight their shortcomings, propose a new definition, and describe how this new definition enables us to more effectively harness the value of demand response in modern power systems. We conclude with a demand response research agenda informed by a discussion of demand response barriers and enablers.

Abstract: Federated learning has recently gained popularity as a framework for distributed clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model using local data. While traditional federated learning relies on a central server for model aggregation, recent advancements adopt a decentralized framework, enabling direct model exchange between clients and eliminating the single point of failure. However, existing decentralized frameworks often assume all clients train a shared model. Personalizing each client's model can enhance performance, especially with heterogeneous client data distributions. We propose FedSPD, an efficient personalized federated learning algorithm for the decentralized setting, and show that it learns accurate models even in low-connectivity networks. To provide theoretical guarantees on convergence, we introduce a clustering-based framework that enables consensus on models for distinct data clusters while personalizing to unique mixtures of these clusters at different clients. This flexibility, allowing selective model updates based on data distribution, substantially reduces communication costs compared to prior work on personalized federated learning in decentralized settings. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that FedSPD outperforms multiple decentralized variants of personalized federated learning algorithms, especially in scenarios with low-connectivity networks.

Abstract: Stochastic decentralized optimization algorithms often suffer from issues such as synchronization overhead and intermittent communication. This paper proposes a $\underline{\rm F}$ully $\underline{\rm S}$tochastic $\underline{\rm P}$rimal $\underline{\rm D}$ual gradient $\underline{\rm A}$lgorithm (FSPDA) that suggests an asynchronous decentralized procedure with (i) sparsified non-blocking communication on random undirected graphs and (ii) local stochastic gradient updates. FSPDA allows multiple local gradient steps to accelerate convergence to stationarity while finding a consensual solution with stochastic primal-dual updates. For problems with smooth (possibly non-convex) objective function, we show that FSPDA converges to an $\mathrm{\mathcal{O}( {\it \sigma /\sqrt{nT}} )}$-stationary solution after $\mathrm{\it T}$ iterations without assuming data heterogeneity. The performance of FSPDA is on par with state-of-the-art algorithms whose convergence depend on static graph and synchronous updates. To our best knowledge, FSPDA is the first asynchronous algorithm that converges exactly under the non-convex setting. Numerical experiments are presented to show the benefits of FSPDA.

Abstract: Conditional information reveal systems automate the release of information upon meeting specific predefined conditions, such as time or location. This paper introduces a breakthrough in the understanding, design, and application of conditional information reveal systems that are highly secure and decentralized. By designing a new practical timed-release cryptography system and a secret sharing scheme with reveal-verifiability, a novel data sharing system is devised on the blockchain that "sends messages in the future" with highly accurate decryption times. Notably, the proposed secret sharing scheme applies to other applications requiring verifiability of revealed secret shares. This paper provides a complete evaluation portfolio of this pioneering paradigm, including analytical results, a validation of its robustness in the Tamarin Prover and a performance evaluation of a real-world, open-source system prototype deployed across the globe. Using real-world election data, we also demonstrate the applicability of this innovative system in e-voting, illustrating its capacity to secure and ensure fair electronic voting processes.

Abstract: We consider the execution of smart contracts on Bitcoin. There, every contract step corresponds to appending to the blockchain a new transaction that spends the output representing the old contract state, creating a new one for the updated state. This standard procedure requires the contract participants to pay transaction fees for every execution step. In this paper, we introduce a protocol that moves most of the execution of a Bitcoin contract off-chain. When all participants follow this protocol, they are able to save on transaction fees, drastically reducing them. By contrast, whenever adversaries try to disrupt the off-chain execution, any honest participant is still able to enforce the correct contract behaviour, by continuing its execution on-chain.

随着Twitter所有权变更及其内容审核政策的变化，学术界的许多人士开始寻求转移讨论阵地，部分人选择了迁移到Mastodon。这项研究考察了这一迁移动态。通过对公开用户账户数据的分析，研究人员追踪了一年内学者们在Mastodon上的发帖活动，并收集了关注关系以描绘内部网络结构。研究发现，迁移至Mastodon的学术群体内部联系紧密，但这种强连接并未能阻止用户重返Twitter或其他平台如Bluesky和Threads。研究显示，由于其去中心化的结构以及来自其他平台的竞争，Mastodon上维持用户参与度存在显著挑战。初期的热情高峰过后，迁移运动失去了势头，大部分用户未能保持活跃度，而坚持使用Mastodon的用户则面临较低的互动水平。研究结果突显了将专业社区过渡到去中心化平台所面临的困难，强调了长期用户参与需要重视社区建设的重要性。 <div>

Abstract: Following changes in Twitter's ownership and subsequent changes to content moderation policies, many in academia looked to move their discourse elsewhere and migration to Mastodon was pursued by some. Our study looks at the dynamics of this migration. Utilizing publicly available user account data, we track the posting activity of academics on Mastodon over a one year period. We also gathered follower-followee relationships to map internal networks, finding that the subset of academics who engaged in migration were well-connected. However, this strong internal connectivity was insufficient to prevent users from returning to Twitter/X. Our analyses reveal significant challenges sustaining user engagement on Mastodon due to its decentralized structure as well as competition from other platforms such as Bluesky and Threads. The movement lost momentum after an initial surge of enthusiasm where the main network was fully established as most users did not maintain their activity levels, and those who did faced lower levels of engagement. Our findings highlight the challenges involved in transitioning professional communities to decentralized platforms, emphasizing the need for focus on community building for long-term user engagement.

Abstract: With the digitalization of society, the interest, the debates and the research efforts concerning "code", "law", "artificial intelligence", and their various relationships, have been widely increasing. Yet, most arguments primarily focus on contemporary computational methods and artifacts (inferential models constructed via machine-learning methods, rule-based systems, smart contracts, ...), rather than attempting to identify more fundamental mechanisms. Aiming to go beyond this conceptual limitation, this paper introduces and elaborates on "normware" as an explicit additional stance -- complementary to software and hardware -- for the interpretation and the design of artificial devices. By means of a few examples, we argue that normware-centred views provide a more adequate abstraction to study and design interactions between computational systems and human institutions, and may help with the design and development of technical interventions within wider socio-technical views.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving privacy. Recently, integrating Foundation Models (FMs) into FL has boosted performance but also introduced a novel backdoor attack mechanism. Attackers can exploit the FM's capabilities to embed backdoors into synthetic data generated by FMs used for model fusion, subsequently infecting all client models through knowledge sharing without involvement in the long-lasting FL process. These novel attacks render existing FL backdoor defenses ineffective, as they primarily detect anomalies among client updates, which may appear uniformly malicious under this attack. Our work proposes a novel data-free defense strategy by constraining abnormal activations in the hidden feature space during model aggregation on the server. The activation constraints, optimized using synthetic data alongside FL training, mitigate the attack while barely affecting model performance, as the parameters remain untouched. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness against both novel and classic backdoor attacks, outperforming existing defenses while maintaining model performance.

本文研究了在非独立同分布数据环境下，联邦学习（Federated Learning, FL）中的统计复杂性问题，指出此类情况下模型准确度可能降低约10%-30%，尤其是在每个边缘设备仅训练单一类别数据的偏斜场景中。为解决这一问题，文章提出了一种名为动态数据队列驱动联邦学习（DDFL）的方法，该方法通过在服务器端创建全局数据子集并动态地分配到各个设备进行训练，从而减少权重分歧带来的偏差项（\(\delta_k\)）。同时，利用数据熵指标监控每轮训练过程并指导合理设备选择参与聚合。此外，文中还对所提DDFL进行了收敛性分析，证明其在实际FL场景中的可行性和对于改进设备选择、实现非次优全局模型以及加快收敛速度的效果。实验结果显示，DDFL方法相较于当前最先进的聚合算法，在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上分别实现了约5%、18%和20%的准确性提升，其中仅使用了10%的全局数据子集。<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach for collaborative model training on edge devices. This distributed method of model training offers advantages in privacy, security, regulatory compliance, and cost-efficiency. Our emphasis in this research lies in addressing statistical complexity in FL, especially when the data stored locally across devices is not identically and independently distributed (non-IID). We have observed an accuracy reduction of up to approximately 10\% to 30\%, particularly in skewed scenarios where each edge device trains with only 1 class of data. This reduction is attributed to weight divergence, quantified using the Euclidean distance between device-level class distributions and the population distribution, resulting in a bias term (\(\delta_k\)). As a solution, we present a method to improve convergence in FL by creating a global subset of data on the server and dynamically distributing it across devices using a Dynamic Data queue-driven Federated Learning (DDFL). Next, we leverage Data Entropy metrics to observe the process during each training round and enable reasonable device selection for aggregation. Furthermore, we provide a convergence analysis of our proposed DDFL to justify their viability in practical FL scenarios, aiming for better device selection, a non-sub-optimal global model, and faster convergence. We observe that our approach results in a substantial accuracy boost of approximately 5\% for the MNIST dataset, around 18\% for CIFAR-10, and 20\% for CIFAR-100 with a 10\% global subset of data, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) aggregation algorithms.

Abstract: One of the biggest challenges of building artificial intelligence (AI) model in healthcare area is the data sharing. Since healthcare data is private, sensitive, and heterogeneous, collecting sufficient data for modelling is exhausted, costly, and sometimes impossible. In this paper, we propose a framework for global healthcare modelling using datasets from multi-continents (Europe, North America and Asia) while without sharing the local datasets, and choose glucose management as a study model to verify its effectiveness. Technically, blockchain-enabled federated learning is implemented with adaption to make it meet with the privacy and safety requirements of healthcare data, meanwhile rewards honest participation and penalize malicious activities using its on-chain incentive mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is effective, efficient, and privacy preserved. Its prediction accuracy is much better than the models trained from limited personal data and is similar to, and even slightly better than, the results from a centralized dataset. This work paves the way for international collaborations on healthcare projects, where additional data is crucial for reducing bias and providing benefits to humanity.

Abstract: In response to global warming and energy shortages, there has been a significant shift towards integrating renewable energy sources, energy storage systems, and electric vehicles. Deploying electric vehicles within smart grids offers a promising solution to reduce carbon emissions. However, managing the charging and discharging processes of them as distributed power supplies present significant challenges. Additionally, the intermittent nature of renewable energy, uncertainties in electric vehicle-related parameters, fluctuating energy prices, and varying loads make maintaining stable power system operations more complex. Effective management systems for electric vehicle battery charging are crucial to coordinating these processes and ensuring a secure, efficient, and reliable power system. Reinforcement learning, enhanced by deep learning, has gained substantial interest for its model-free approach and real-time optimization, effectively managing electric vehicle charging by maximizing cumulative rewards. This review synthesizes existing literature on reinforcement learning-based frameworks, objectives, and architectures for electric vehicle charging coordination strategies in power systems, classifying methods into centralized and decentralized categories. Additionally, the article offers suggestions for future research directions to further enhance reinforcement learning-based electric vehicle charging optimization.

总结:

本文关注深度强化学习的可解释性问题，提出了一种新的方法用于从DRL策略中提取具有决策树结构的策略。研究者建立了专家策略与最优决策树策略之间回报差距上界的理论框架。在此基础上，他们将决策树提取问题转化为非欧几里得聚类问题，并设计了一个迭代生长决策树的算法来适应多智能体的分布式场景。此外，文章提出了“回报差距最小化决策树”（Return-Gap-Minimization Decision Tree, RGMDT）算法，该算法通过结合强化学习和新颖的正则化信息最大化损失函数进行集成。实验表明，RGMDT算法在如D4RL等任务上显著优于基于启发式的DT基线，并能在给定的决策树复杂度约束下实现接近最优的回报。 <div>

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have achieved great success in solving many challenging tasks while their black-box nature hinders interpretability and real-world applicability, making it difficult for human experts to interpret and understand DRL policies. Existing works on interpretable reinforcement learning have shown promise in extracting decision tree (DT) based policies from DRL policies with most focus on the single-agent settings while prior attempts to introduce DT policies in multi-agent scenarios mainly focus on heuristic designs which do not provide any quantitative guarantees on the expected return. In this paper, we establish an upper bound on the return gap between the oracle expert policy and an optimal decision tree policy. This enables us to recast the DT extraction problem into a novel non-euclidean clustering problem over the local observation and action values space of each agent, with action values as cluster labels and the upper bound on the return gap as clustering loss. Both the algorithm and the upper bound are extended to multi-agent decentralized DT extractions by an iteratively-grow-DT procedure guided by an action-value function conditioned on the current DTs of other agents. Further, we propose the Return-Gap-Minimization Decision Tree (RGMDT) algorithm, which is a surprisingly simple design and is integrated with reinforcement learning through the utilization of a novel Regularized Information Maximization loss. Evaluations on tasks like D4RL show that RGMDT significantly outperforms heuristic DT-based baselines and can achieve nearly optimal returns under given DT complexity constraints (e.g., maximum number of DT nodes).

Abstract: We present NodeOP, a novel framework designed to optimize the management of General Node Operators in decentralized networks. By integrating Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) with a Tendermint Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)-based consensus mechanism, NodeOP addresses key challenges in task allocation, consensus formation, and system stability. Through rigorous mathematical modeling and formal optimization, NodeOP ensures stable equilibrium in node task distribution. We validate the framework via convergence analysis and performance metrics such as transaction throughput, system latency, and fault tolerance. We further demonstrate NodeOP's practical utility through two use cases: decentralized sequencer management in Layer 2 networks and off-chain payment validation. These examples underscore how NodeOP enhances validation efficiency and unlocks new revenue opportunities in large-scale decentralized environments. Our results position NodeOP as a scalable and flexible solution, significantly improving operational efficiency and economic sustainability in decentralized systems.

Abstract: With the emergence of low-inertia microgrids powered by inverter-based generation, there remains a concern about the operational resilience of these systems. Grid-forming inverters (GFMs), enabled by various device-level (primary) and system-level (secondary) control methods, are poised to play a significant role in achieving certain operational objectives, such as the effective utilization of clean energy resources while maintaining stability. However, despite the recent advances in GFMs, there is a lack of suitable controls that can ascertain resilience-constrained operations, like maintaining critical operational safety limits during transients under various cyber-physical disruptions. In this work, we develop decentralized autonomous controllers (DACs) that enforce resilience-constrained operation via local, minimally invasive adjustments (e.g., changes in set-points) while co-existing within the hierarchy of existing (primary and secondary) controls. The DACs work autonomously by sensing only local GFM measurements and act only when operational resilience constraints are violated. The proposed DAC scheme is computationally efficient (only algebraic computations), which enables fast, real-time execution and demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed control framework on GridLAB-D-HELICS-based control-grid co-simulations on the IEEE 123-node networked microgrid. Finally, we show how the developed DACs empower the grid by utilizing the available resources entirely to ensure resilience (maintain frequency safe limits).

Abstract: Turing completeness has made Ethereum smart contracts attractive to blockchain developers and attackers alike. To increase code security, many tools can now spot most known vulnerabilities$-$at the cost of production efficiency. Recent studies show false-positive ratios over 99% in state-of-the-art technologies: this makes them impractical for use in industry and have raised questions on the direction of academic research. In this work we show how integrating and extending current analyses is not only feasible, but also a next logical step in smart-contract security. We propose light-weight static checks on the morphology and dynamics of Solidity code, stemming from a developer-centric notion of vulnerability, that we use to verify the output of other tools, flag potential false alarms, and suggest verifications. Besides technical details we implemented an open-source prototype. For three top-10 vulnerabilities it flags 324 warnings of other tools as false-positives, in 60 verified de-duplicated smart contracts selected from the blockchain by the presence of true (and false) vulnerabilities. This amounts to a 92%- to 100%-reduction in the number of false-positives for these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: We study Federated Causal Inference, an approach to estimate treatment effects from decentralized data across centers. We compare three classes of Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimators derived from the Plug-in G-Formula, ranging from simple meta-analysis to one-shot and multi-shot federated learning, the latter leveraging the full data to learn the outcome model (albeit requiring more communication). Focusing on Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), we derive the asymptotic variance of these estimators for linear models. Our results provide practical guidance on selecting the appropriate estimator for various scenarios, including heterogeneity in sample sizes, covariate distributions, treatment assignment schemes, and center effects. We validate these findings with a simulation study.

总结:

本文提出了解决在存在定位误差的分布式多智能体轨迹规划问题的方法。首先，为了解决由于不确定性导致的轨迹冲突，文章介绍了两个感知感知型、分布式的异步多智能体轨迹规划器——PARM和PARM*，它们利用感知信息使团队中的智能体能在不确定环境中实现避障与轨迹解冲突。其中，PARM*相较于PARM更为优化但计算量较大。然而，这类基于优化的方法面临高计算成本的问题，使得智能体难以高频重规划。为此，文章提出了第二个关键贡献——PRIMER，这是一种基于模仿学习（IL）训练的学习型规划器，它以PARM*作为专家演示者进行训练。PRIMER利用神经网络在部署时的低计算需求，实现了相对于优化方法高达5500倍的计算速度提升。 <div>

Abstract: In decentralized multiagent trajectory planners, agents need to communicate and exchange their positions to generate collision-free trajectories. However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.

Abstract: Since Bitcoin first appeared on the scene in 2009, cryptocurrencies have become a worldwide phenomenon as important decentralized financial assets. Their decentralized nature, however, leads to notable volatility against traditional fiat currencies, making the task of accurately forecasting the crypto-fiat exchange rate complex. This study examines the various independent factors that affect the volatility of the Bitcoin-Dollar exchange rate. To this end, we propose CoMForE, a multimodal AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble model, which not only utilizes historical trading data but also incorporates public sentiments from related tweets, public interest demonstrated by search volumes, and blockchain hash-rate data. Our developed model goes a step further by predicting fluctuations in the overall cryptocurrency value distribution, thus increasing its value for investment decision-making. We have subjected this method to extensive testing via comprehensive experiments, thereby validating the importance of multimodal combination over exclusive reliance on trading data. Further experiments show that our method significantly surpasses existing forecasting tools and methodologies, demonstrating a 19.29% improvement. This result underscores the influence of external independent factors on cryptocurrency volatility.

Abstract: Empirical studies show that federated learning exhibits convergence issues in Non Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) setups. However, these studies only focus on label distribution shifts, or concept shifts (e.g. ambiguous tasks). In this paper, we explore for the first time the effect of covariate shifts between participants' data in 2D segmentation tasks, showing an impact way less serious than label shifts but still present on convergence. Moreover, current Personalized (PFL) and Clustered (CFL) Federated Learning methods intrinsically assume the homogeneity of the dataset of each participant and its consistency with future test samples by operating at the client level. We introduce a more general and realistic framework where each participant owns a mixture of multiple underlying feature domain distributions. To diagnose such pathological feature distributions affecting a model being trained in a federated fashion, we develop Deep Domain Isolation (DDI) to isolate image domains directly in the gradient space of the model. A federated Gaussian Mixture Model is fit to the sample gradients of each class, while the results are combined with spectral clustering on the server side to isolate decentralized sample-level domains. We leverage this clustering algorithm through a Sample Clustered Federated Learning (SCFL) framework, performing standard federated learning of several independent models, one for each decentralized image domain. Finally, we train a classifier enabling to associate a test sample to its corresponding domain cluster at inference time, offering a final set of models that are agnostic to any assumptions on the test distribution of each participant. We validate our approach on a toy segmentation dataset as well as different partitionings of a combination of Cityscapes and GTA5 datasets using an EfficientVIT-B0 model, showing a significant performance gain compared to other approaches.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach to medical image analysis that allows deep model training using decentralized data while ensuring data privacy. However, in the field of FL, communication cost plays a critical role in evaluating the performance of the model. Thus, transferring vision foundation models can be particularly challenging due to the significant resource costs involved. In this paper, we introduce a federated adaptive Contrastive Language Image Pretraining CLIP model designed for classification tasks. We employ a light-weight and efficient feature attention module for CLIP that selects suitable features for each client's data. Additionally, we propose a domain adaptation technique to reduce differences in data distribution between clients. Experimental results on four publicly available datasets demonstrate the superior performance of FACMIC in dealing with real-world and multisource medical imaging data.

Abstract: On-device control agents, especially on mobile devices, are responsible for operating mobile devices to fulfill users' requests, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions. Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into these agents enhances their ability to understand and execute complex commands, thereby improving user experience. However, fine-tuning MLLMs for on-device control presents significant challenges due to limited data availability and inefficient online training processes. This paper introduces DistRL, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online RL fine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralized training and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning in the context of dynamic online interactions. Additionally, the framework is backed by our tailor-made RL algorithm, which effectively balances exploration with the prioritized utilization of collected data to ensure stable and robust training. Our experiments show that, on average, DistRL delivers a 3X improvement in training efficiency and enables training data collection 2.4X faster than the leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, after training, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks from an open benchmark, significantly outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the same training time. These results validate DistRL as a scalable and efficient solution, offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency and agent performance for real-world, in-the-wild device control tasks.

Grid-forming inverters (GFMs) are emerging as a dominant technology with synchronous generators (SG)-like characteristics through primary control loops. Advanced secondary control schemes, e.g., consensus algorithms, allow GFM-interfaced storage units to participate in frequency regulations and restore nominal frequency following grid disturbances. However, it is imperative to ensure transient frequency excursions do not violate critical safety limits while the grid transitions from pre- to post-disturbance operating point. This paper presents a hierarchical safety-enforced consensus method -- combining a device-layer (decentralized) transient safety filter with a secondary-layer (distributed) consensus coordination -- to achieve three distinct objectives: limiting transient frequency excursions to safe limits, minimizing frequency deviations from nominal, and ensuring coordinated power sharing among GFM-storage units. The proposed hierarchical (two-layered) safety-consensus technique is illustrated using a GFM-interfaced storage network on an IEEE 68-bus system under multiple grid transient scenarios.

<div> 关键词：多智能体系统、公平性、强化学习、导航、效率

总结:
本文研究了在多智能体环境中使用强化学习实现公平导航的问题。为了解决效率与公平之间的平衡，作者提出了一个结合最小最大公平距离目标分配和鼓励公平性的奖励机制的训练方法。通过这种方法，智能体能够在仅依赖局部观测的情况下，学习到公平的目标分配并几乎完美地覆盖导航任务。实验结果显示，相比于随机目标分配基线，该模型在保持平均14%的效率提升的同时，实现了平均5%的公平性提升；相较于最优效率分配模型，虽然以7%的效率下降为代价，但公平性提升了21%。此外，该方法还被扩展到了需要按预定阵型完成覆盖任务的环境，并展示了无需针对特定阵型定制模型即可实现这一目标的可能性。 <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent systems are trained to maximize shared cost objectives, which typically reflect system-level efficiency. However, in the resource-constrained environments of mobility and transportation systems, efficiency may be achieved at the expense of fairness -- certain agents may incur significantly greater costs or lower rewards compared to others. Tasks could be distributed inequitably, leading to some agents receiving an unfair advantage while others incur disproportionately high costs. It is important to consider the tradeoffs between efficiency and fairness. We consider the problem of fair multi-agent navigation for a group of decentralized agents using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We consider the reciprocal of the coefficient of variation of the distances traveled by different agents as a measure of fairness and investigate whether agents can learn to be fair without significantly sacrificing efficiency (i.e., increasing the total distance traveled). We find that by training agents using min-max fair distance goal assignments along with a reward term that incentivizes fairness as they move towards their goals, the agents (1) learn a fair assignment of goals and (2) achieve almost perfect goal coverage in navigation scenarios using only local observations. For goal coverage scenarios, we find that, on average, our model yields a 14% improvement in efficiency and a 5% improvement in fairness over a baseline trained using random assignments. Furthermore, an average of 21% improvement in fairness can be achieved compared to a model trained on optimally efficient assignments; this increase in fairness comes at the expense of only a 7% decrease in efficiency. Finally, we extend our method to environments in which agents must complete coverage tasks in prescribed formations and show that it is possible to do so without tailoring the models to specific formation shapes.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise in tackling complex tasks, but often rely on predefined roles and centralized coordination, limiting their adaptability to evolving challenges. This paper introduces MorphAgent, a novel framework for decentralized multi-agent collaboration that enables agents to dynamically evolve their roles and capabilities. Our approach employs self-evolving agent profiles, optimized through three key metrics, guiding agents in refining their individual expertise while maintaining complementary team dynamics. MorphAgent implements a two-phase process: a warm-up phase for initial profile optimization, followed by a task execution phase where agents continuously adapt their roles based on task feedback. Our experimental results show that MorphAgent outperforms traditional static-role MAS in terms of task performance and adaptability to changing requirements, paving the way for more robust and versatile multi-agent collaborative systems. Our code will be publicly available at \url{https://github.com/LINs-lab/learn2collaborate}.

Abstract: Federated Learning(FL) is popular as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm for generating a single model on decentralized data. However, statistical heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for FL. As a subfield of FL, personalized FL (pFL) has attracted attention for its ability to achieve personalized models that perform well on non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. However, existing pFL methods are limited in terms of leveraging the global model's knowledge to enhance generalization while achieving personalization on local data. To address this, we proposed a new method personalized Federated learning with Adaptive Feature Aggregation and Knowledge Transfer (FedAFK), to train better feature extractors while balancing generalization and personalization for participating clients, which improves the performance of personalized models on Non-IID data. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets in two widely-used heterogeneous settings and show the superior performance of our proposed method over thirteen state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: In the current era of artificial intelligence, federated learning has emerged as a novel approach to addressing data privacy concerns inherent in centralized learning paradigms. This decentralized learning model not only mitigates the risk of data breaches but also enhances the system's scalability and robustness. However, this approach introduces a new challenge: how to fairly and accurately assess the contribution of each participant. Developing an effective contribution evaluation mechanism is crucial for federated learning. Such a mechanism incentivizes participants to actively contribute their data and computational resources, thereby improving the overall performance of the federated learning system. By allocating resources and rewards based on the size of the contributions, it ensures that each participant receives fair treatment, fostering sustained engagement.Currently, Shapley value-based methods are widely used to evaluate participants' contributions, with many researchers proposing modifications to adapt these methods to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a component called Dynamic Pruning Validation Set Shapley (DPVS-Shapley). This method accelerates the contribution assessment process by dynamically pruning the original dataset without compromising the evaluation's accuracy. Furthermore, this component can assign different weights to various samples, thereby allowing clients capable of distinguishing difficult examples to receive higher contribution scores.

本文提出了一种数据驱动的解决主动配电系统中伏特-瓦特(Volt-VAR)控制问题的方法。针对配电系统模型往往不准确和不完整的问题，该文将Volt-VAR控制问题建模为约束马尔科夫决策过程(CMDP)。通过结合增广拉格朗日法与软策略迭代算法，文中创新性地提出了一种安全的离线强化学习方法来求解CMDP。该算法利用拉格朗日值函数对策略网络进行梯度更新，并采用双批评网络同步估计动作价值函数以避免过估计偏差。此方法无需被优化问题具有强凸性保证，并具备样本效率。采取两阶段策略分别进行离线训练和在线执行，因此不再需要精确的配电系统模型。为了实现可扩展性，文章采用了集中式训练分布式执行的多智能体框架，实现了大规模配电系统的去中心化Volt-VAR控制。通过使用真实电力数据的综合数值实验表明，所提出的算法能够达到较高的解决方案最优性和约束满足性。 <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven solution for Volt-VAR control problem in active distribution system. As distribution system models are always inaccurate and incomplete, it is quite difficult to solve the problem. To handle with this dilemma, this paper formulates the Volt-VAR control problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). By synergistically combining the augmented Lagrangian method and soft actor critic algorithm, a novel safe off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) approach is proposed in this paper to solve the CMDP. The actor network is updated in a policy gradient manner with the Lagrangian value function. A double-critics network is adopted to synchronously estimate the action-value function to avoid overestimation bias. The proposed algorithm does not require strong convexity guarantee of examined problems and is sample efficient. A two-stage strategy is adopted for offline training and online execution, so the accurate distribution system model is no longer needed. To achieve scalability, a centralized training distributed execution strategy is adopted for a multi-agent framework, which enables a decentralized Volt-VAR control for large-scale distribution system. Comprehensive numerical experiments with real-world electricity data demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can achieve high solution optimality and constraints compliance.

Abstract: Can peer recommendation engines elevate people's creative performances in self-organizing social networks? Answering this question requires resolving challenges in data collection (e.g., tracing inspiration links and psycho-social attributes of nodes) and intervention design (e.g., balancing idea stimulation and redundancy in evolving information environments). We trained a model that predicts people's ideation performances using semantic and network-structural features in an online platform. Using this model, we built SocialMuse, which maximizes people's predicted performances to generate peer recommendations for them. We found treatment networks leveraging SocialMuse outperforming AI-agnostic control networks in several creativity measures. The treatment networks were more decentralized than the control, as SocialMuse increasingly emphasized network-structural features at large network sizes. This decentralization spreads people's inspiration sources, helping inspired ideas stand out better. Our study provides actionable insights into building intelligent systems for elevating creativity.

Abstract: Web3 aims to enhance user control over data and assets, but this vision is challenged by non-transparent, scam-prone applications and vulnerable smart contracts. While code audits are one solution to this problem, the lack of smart contracts source code on many blockchain platforms, such as Sui, hinders the ease of auditing. A promising approach to this issue is the use of a decompiler to reverse-engineer smart contract bytecode. However, existing decompilers for Sui produce code that is difficult to understand and cannot be directly recompiled. To address this, we developed the Move AI Decompiler (MAD), a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered web application that decompiles smart contract bytecodes on Sui into logically correct, human-readable, and re-compilable source code.
  Our evaluation shows that MAD produces logically correct code that successfully passes original unit tests and achieves a 66.7% recompilation success rate on real-world smart contracts. Additionally, in a user study involving 12 developers, MAD significantly reduced the auditing workload compared to using traditional decompilers. Participants found MAD's outputs comparable to the original source code, simplifying the process of smart contract logic comprehension and auditing. Despite some limitations, such as occasional hallucinations and compile errors, MAD still provides significant improvements over traditional decompilers.
  MAD has practical implications for blockchain smart contract transparency, auditing, and education. It empowers users to review and audit non-open-source smart contracts, fostering trust and accountability. Additionally, MAD's approach could potentially extend to other smart contract languages, like Solidity, promoting transparency across various blockchains.

总结:
本文介绍了随着软件系统的快速发展和越来越多的安全漏洞报告，准确识别易受攻击的代码段变得愈发重要。传统的漏洞定位方法如手动代码审查或基于规则的工具效率低下，且范围有限。近年来，GPT和LLaMA等大型语言模型为自动化漏洞检测开辟了新途径，但它们在处理长代码上下文时保持准确性方面存在挑战。为此，文章提出了LOVA这一新颖框架，它利用大型语言模型内在的自注意力机制增强漏洞定位能力。LOVA的核心思想是通过分析模型对输入代码各部分的不同关注度来追踪并重点考察可能具有更高风险的代码行。实验结果显示，LOVA在F1分数上相对于现有LLM基线方法表现出显著优势，提高了高达5.3倍的性能；同时，它在C、Python、Java和Solidity等多种编程语言的智能合约漏洞定位中展现出出色的可扩展性，效能提升达到14.6倍，并证明了其在不同LLM架构下的稳健性能。 <div>

Abstract: The rapid expansion of software systems and the growing number of reported vulnerabilities have emphasized the importance of accurately identifying vulnerable code segments. Traditional methods for vulnerability localization, such as manual code audits or rule-based tools, are often time-consuming and limited in scope, typically focusing on specific programming languages or types of vulnerabilities. In recent years, the introduction of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT and LLaMA has opened new possibilities for automating vulnerability detection. However, while LLMs show promise in this area, they face challenges, particularly in maintaining accuracy over longer code contexts. This paper introduces LOVA, a novel framework leveraging the self-attention mechanisms inherent in LLMs to enhance vulnerability localization. Our key insight is that self-attention mechanisms assign varying importance to different parts of the input, making it possible to track how much attention the model focuses on specific lines of code. In the context of vulnerability localization, the hypothesis is that vulnerable lines of code will naturally attract higher attention weights because they have a greater influence on the model's output. By systematically tracking changes in attention weights and focusing on specific lines of code, LOVA improves the precision of identifying vulnerable lines across various programming languages. Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate that LOVA significantly outperforms existing LLM-based approaches, achieving up to a 5.3x improvement in F1-scores. LOVA also demonstrated strong scalability, with up to a 14.6x improvement in smart contract vulnerability localization across languages like C, Python, Java, and Solidity. Its robustness was proven through consistent performance across different LLM architectures.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel distributed approach for solving a cooperative Constrained Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (CMARL) problem, where agents seek to minimize a global objective function subject to shared constraints. Unlike existing methods that rely on centralized training or coordination, our approach enables fully decentralized online learning, with each agent maintaining local estimates of both primal and dual variables. Specifically, we develop a distributed primal-dual algorithm based on actor-critic methods, leveraging local information to estimate Lagrangian multipliers. We establish consensus among the Lagrangian multipliers across agents and prove the convergence of our algorithm to an equilibrium point, analyzing the sub-optimality of this equilibrium compared to the exact solution of the unparameterized problem. Furthermore, we introduce a constrained cooperative Cournot game with stochastic dynamics as a test environment to evaluate the algorithm's performance in complex, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This paper designs a novel trajectory planning approach to resolve the computational efficiency and safety problems in uncoordinated methods by exploiting vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology. The trajectory planning for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is formulated as a game with coupled safety constraints. We then define interaction-fair trajectories and prove that they correspond to the variational equilibrium (VE) of this game. We propose a semi-decentralized planner for the vehicles to seek VE-based fair trajectories, which can significantly improve computational efficiency through parallel computing among CAVs and enhance the safety of planned trajectories by ensuring equilibrium concordance among CAVs. Finally, experimental results show the advantages of the approach, including fast computation speed, high scalability, equilibrium concordance, and safety.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning into smart grid systems represents a transformative step in enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of modern energy networks. By adding advanced data analytics, these systems can better manage the complexities of renewable energy integration, demand response, and predictive maintenance. Machine learning algorithms analyze vast amounts of data from smart meters, sensors, and other grid components to optimize energy distribution, forecast demand, and detect irregularities that could indicate potential failures. This enables more precise load balancing, reduces operational costs, and enhances the resilience of the grid against disturbances. Furthermore, the use of predictive models helps in anticipating equipment failures, thereby improving the reliability of the energy supply. As smart grids continue to evolve, the role of machine learning in managing decentralized energy sources and enabling real-time decision-making will become increasingly critical. However, the deployment of these technologies also raises challenges related to data privacy, security, and the need for robust infrastructure. Addressing these issues in this research authors will focus on realizing the full potential of smart grids, ensuring they meet the growing energy demands while maintaining a focus on sustainability and efficiency using Machine Learning techniques. Furthermore, this research will help determine the smart grid's essentiality with the aid of Machine Learning. Multiple ML algorithms have been integrated along with their pros and cons. The future scope of these algorithms are also integrated.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a very promising technology designed to provide both high rate communication capabilities and sensing capabilities. However, in Massive Multi User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (Massive MU MIMO-ISAC) systems, the dense user access creates a serious multi-user interference (MUI) problem, leading to degradation of communication performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) precoding method. We first model the MUI of dense user scenarios with minimizing Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) as an objective function.Hybrid precoding is an attractive ISAC technique, and hybrid precoding using Partially Connected Structures (PCS) can effectively reduce hardware cost and power consumption. We mitigate the MUI between dense users based on ThomlinsonHarashima Precoding (THP). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through simulation experiments. Compared with the existing methods, it can effectively improve the communication data rates and energy efficiency in dense user access scenario, and reduce the hardware complexity of Massive MU MIMO-ISAC systems. The experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of our method for improving the MUI problem in ISAC systems for dense user access scenarios.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized AI mechanism suitable for a large number of devices like in smart IoT. A major challenge of FL is the non-IID dataset problem, originating from the heterogeneous data collected by FL participants, leading to performance deterioration of the trained global model. There have been various attempts to rectify non-IID dataset, mostly focusing on manipulating the collected data. This paper, however, proposes a novel approach to ensure data IIDness by properly clustering and grouping mobile IoT nodes exploiting their geographical characteristics, so that each FL group can achieve IID dataset. We first provide an experimental evidence for the independence and identicalness features of IoT data according to the inter-device distance, and then propose Dynamic Clustering and Partial-Steady Grouping algorithms that partition FL participants to achieve near-IIDness in their dataset while considering device mobility. Our mechanism significantly outperforms benchmark grouping algorithms at least by 110 times in terms of the joint cost between the number of dropout devices and the evenness in per-group device count, with a mild increase in the number of groups only by up to 0.93 groups.

Abstract: Options are fundamental to blockchain-based financial markets, offering essential tools for risk management and price speculation, which enhance liquidity, flexibility, and market efficiency in decentralized finance (DeFi). Despite the growing interest in options for blockchain-resident assets, such as cryptocurrencies, current option mechanisms face significant challenges, including limited asset support, high trading delays, and the requirement for option holders to provide upfront collateral.
  In this paper, we present a protocol that addresses the aforementioned issues by facilitating efficient and universally accessible option trading without requiring holders to post collateral when establishing options. Our protocol's universality allows for cross-chain options involving nearly $\textit{any}$ assets on $\textit{any}$ two different blockchains, provided the chains' programming languages can enforce and execute the necessary contract logic. A key innovation in our approach is the use of Double-Authentication-Preventing Signatures (DAPS), which significantly reduces trading latency. Additionally, by introducing a guarantee from the option writer, our protocol removes the need of upfront collateral from holders. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed scheme reduces option transfer latency to less than half of that in existing methods. Rigorous security analysis proves that our protocol achieves secure option trading, even when facing adversarial behaviors.

Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning, a commonly considered paradigm is centralized training with decentralized execution. However, in this framework, decentralized execution restricts the development of coordinated policies due to the local observation limitation. In this paper, we consider the cooperation among neighboring agents during execution and formulate their interactions as a graph. Thus, we introduce a novel encoder-decoder architecture named Factor-based Multi-Agent Transformer ($f$-MAT) that utilizes a transformer to enable the communication between neighboring agents during both training and execution. By dividing agents into different overlapping groups and representing each group with a factor, $f$-MAT fulfills efficient message passing among agents through factor-based attention layers. Empirical results on networked systems such as traffic scheduling and power control demonstrate that $f$-MAT achieves superior performance compared to strong baselines, thereby paving the way for handling complex collaborative problems.

Abstract: Due to the involvement of multiple intermediaries without trusted parties, lack of proper regulations, and a complicated supply chain, ad impression discrepancy affects online advertising. This issue causes up to $82 billion annual revenue loss for honest parties. The loss can be significantly reduced with a precise and trusted decentralized mechanism. This paper presents AdChain, a decentralized, distributed, and verifiable solution that detects and minimizes online advertisement impression discrepancies. AdChain establishes trust by employing multiple independent agents to receive and record log-level data, along with a consensus protocol to validate each ad data. AdChain is scalable, efficient, and compatible with the current infrastructure. Our experimental evaluation, using over half a million ad data points, identifies system parameters that achieve 98% accuracy, reducing the ad discrepancy rate from 20% to 2%. Our cost analysis shows that active nodes on AdChain can generate profits comparable to miners on major blockchain networks like Bitcoin.

Abstract: This paper reports a new hierarchical architecture for modeling autonomous multi-robot systems (MRSs): a nonlinear dynamical opinion process is used to model high-level group choice, and multi-objective behavior optimization is used to model individual decisions. Using previously reported theoretical results, we show it is possible to design the behavior of the MRS by the selection of a relatively small set of parameters. The resulting behavior - both collective actions and individual actions - can be understood intuitively. The approach is entirely decentralized and the communication cost scales by the number of group options, not agents. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach using a hypothetical `explore-exploit-migrate' scenario in a two hour field demonstration with eight unmanned surface vessels (USVs). The results from our preliminary field experiment show the collective behavior is robust even with time-varying network topology and agent dropouts.

Abstract: Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are considered a potential solution for future transportation challenges, aiming to develop systems that are efficient, safe, and environmentally friendly. However, CAV control presents significant challenges due to the complexity of interconnectivity and coordination required among vehicles. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which has shown notable advancements in addressing complex problems in autonomous driving, robotics, and human-vehicle interaction, emerges as a promising tool to enhance CAV capabilities. Despite its potential, there is a notable absence of current reviews on mainstream MARL algorithms for CAVs. To fill this gap, this paper offers a comprehensive review of MARL's application in CAV control. The paper begins with an introduction to MARL, explaining its unique advantages in handling complex and multi-agent scenarios. It then presents a detailed survey of MARL applications across various control dimensions for CAVs, including critical scenarios such as platooning control, lane-changing, and unsignalized intersections. Additionally, the paper reviews prominent simulation platforms essential for developing and testing MARL algorithms. Lastly, it examines the current challenges in deploying MARL for CAV control, including macro-micro optimization, communication, mixed traffic, and sim-to-real challenges. Potential solutions discussed include hierarchical MARL, decentralized MARL, adaptive interactions, and offline MARL.

Abstract: When independently trained or designed robots are deployed in a shared environment, their combined actions can lead to unintended negative side effects (NSEs). To ensure safe and efficient operation, robots must optimize task performance while minimizing the penalties associated with NSEs, balancing individual objectives with collective impact. We model the problem of mitigating NSEs in a cooperative multi-agent system as a bi-objective lexicographic decentralized Markov decision process. We assume independence of transitions and rewards with respect to the robots' tasks, but the joint NSE penalty creates a form of dependence in this setting. To improve scalability, the joint NSE penalty is decomposed into individual penalties for each robot using credit assignment, which facilitates decentralized policy computation. We empirically demonstrate, using mobile robots and in simulation, the effectiveness and scalability of our approach in mitigating NSEs.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel estimator-based safety-critical controller for formation control of non-holonomic mobile robots in communication-limited environments. The proposed decentralized framework integrates a robust state estimator with a formation tracking control law, addressing the challenges of inter-agent collision avoidance and disturbance attenuation in leader-follower formations using control barrier functions. The estimator's design accounts for both constant and time-varying velocity profiles, enhancing the system's adaptability to dynamic scenarios. A closed-form solution for the tracking controller facilitates efficient implementation while maintaining formation integrity. The incorporation of string stability metrics further reinforces the framework's resilience against propagating disturbances from predecessors. Rigorous stability analysis using Lyapunov functions ensures the stability of estimation errors and the convergence of the formation to desired configurations. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach are validated through numerical simulations of various maneuvers and realistic Gazebo experiments involving formations in a warehouse environment. The results demonstrate the controller's ability to maintain safety, achieve precise formation control, and mitigate disturbances in scenarios without inter-robot communication.

Abstract: The rise of blockchain technologies has greatly accelerated the development and deployment of smart contracts. However, their inherent vulnerabilities and susceptibility to bugs have led to significant financial losses, underscoring the challenges in securing smart contracts. While traditional auditing methods are crucial, they often fall short in addressing the increasing complexity and volume of smart contracts. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions for enhancing software auditing by automatically identifying security vulnerabilities. Despite their potential, the practical application of these models is hindered by substantial computational demands. This paper investigates the feasibility of using smaller, fine-tuned models to achieve comparable or even superior results in smart contract auditing. We introduce the FTSmartAudit framework, which is designed to develop cost-effective, specialized models for smart contract auditing through the fine-tuning of LLMs. Our contributions include: (1) a single-task learning framework that streamlines data preparation, training, evaluation, and continuous learning; (2) a robust dataset generation method utilizing domain-special knowledge distillation to produce high-quality datasets from advanced models like GPT-4o; (3) an adaptive learning strategy to maintain model accuracy and robustness; (4) the proven effectiveness of fine-tuned models in detecting specific vulnerabilities and complex logical errors; and (5) a framework that can be extended to other domains requiring LLM solutions. Our experimental results demonstrate that smaller models can surpass state-of-the-art commercial models and tools in detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

Abstract: Multiagent systems grapple with partial observability (PO), and the decentralized POMDP (Dec-POMDP) model highlights the fundamental nature of this challenge. Whereas recent approaches to address PO have appealed to deep learning models, providing a rigorous understanding of how these models and their approximation errors affect agents' handling of PO and their interactions remain a challenge. In addressing this challenge, we investigate reconstructing global states from local action-observation histories in Dec-POMDPs using diffusion models. We first find that diffusion models conditioned on local history represent possible states as stable fixed points. In collectively observable (CO) Dec-POMDPs, individual diffusion models conditioned on agents' local histories share a unique fixed point corresponding to the global state, while in non-CO settings, the shared fixed points yield a distribution of possible states given joint history. We further find that, with deep learning approximation errors, fixed points can deviate from true states and the deviation is negatively correlated to the Jacobian rank. Inspired by this low-rank property, we bound the deviation by constructing a surrogate linear regression model that approximates the local behavior of diffusion models. With this bound, we propose a composite diffusion process iterating over agents with theoretical convergence guarantees to the true state.

Abstract: Graphs play a crucial role in data mining and machine learning, representing real-world objects and interactions. As graph datasets grow, managing large, decentralized subgraphs becomes essential, particularly within federated learning frameworks. These frameworks face significant challenges, including missing neighbor information, which can compromise model reliability in safety-critical settings. Deployment of federated learning models trained in such settings necessitates quantifying the uncertainty of the models. This study extends the applicability of Conformal Prediction (CP), a well-established method for uncertainty quantification, to federated graph learning. We specifically tackle the missing links issue in distributed subgraphs to minimize its adverse effects on CP set sizes. We discuss data dependencies across the distributed subgraphs and establish conditions for CP validity and precise test-time coverage. We introduce a Variational Autoencoder-based approach for reconstructing missing neighbors to mitigate the negative impact of missing data. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, yielding smaller prediction sets while ensuring coverage guarantees.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients with distributed data sources to collaboratively train a shared model without compromising data privacy. However, existing FL paradigms face challenges due to heterogeneity in client data distributions and system capabilities. Personalized federated learning (pFL) has been proposed to mitigate these problems, but often requires a shared model architecture and a central entity for parameter aggregation, resulting in scalability and communication issues. More recently, model-heterogeneous FL has gained attention due to its ability to support diverse client models, but existing methods are limited by their dependence on a centralized framework, synchronized training, and publicly available datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce Federated Peer-Adaptive Ensemble Learning (FedPAE), a fully decentralized pFL algorithm that supports model heterogeneity and asynchronous learning. Our approach utilizes a peer-to-peer model sharing mechanism and ensemble selection to achieve a more refined balance between local and global information. Experimental results show that FedPAE outperforms existing state-of-the-art pFL algorithms, effectively managing diverse client capabilities and demonstrating robustness against statistical heterogeneity.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization, crucial for hyperparameter tuning, meta-learning and reinforcement learning, remains less explored in the decentralized learning paradigm, such as decentralized federated learning (DFL).

To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a fully first-order decentralized method for decentralized Bilevel optimization, $\text{C}^2$DFB which is both compute- and communicate-efficient. In $\text{C}^2$DFB, each learning node optimizes a min-min-max problem to approximate hypergradient by exclusively using gradients information. To reduce the traffic load at the inner-loop of solving the lower-level problem, $\text{C}^2$DFB incorporates a lightweight communication protocol for efficiently transmitting compressed residuals of local parameters. % during the inner loops. Rigorous theoretical analysis ensures its convergence % of the algorithm, indicating a first-order oracle calls of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$. Experiments on hyperparameter tuning and hyper-representation tasks validate the superiority of $\text{C}^2$DFB across various typologies and heterogeneous data distributions.

本文提出了一种新颖的用于提升物联网网络入侵检测性能的联邦学习方法。针对传统集中式机器学习方法在处理 IoT 网络数据可用性、计算资源、传输成本以及特别是隐私保护方面存在的不足，研究者开发了一个结合了收缩自编码器和中心点一类分类器(SAE-CEN)的半监督联邦学习模型。该模型能有效地表征正常网络数据并准确识别分布式环境中的异常行为。同时，文中还引入了一个基于均方误差的聚合算法(MSEAvg)，通过优先考虑更精确的局部模型来提高全局模型的性能。实验结果表明，在使用N-BaIoT数据集和Dirichlet分布的不同设置下，这种方法在实际异构物联网网络中显著提高了检测精度（从93.98$\pm$2.90提升到97.30$\pm$0.49），并且在仅需要50%网关参与训练的情况下降低了学习成本，同时在大规模网络中表现出良好的鲁棒性。 <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel federated learning approach for improving IoT network intrusion detection. The rise of IoT has expanded the cyber attack surface, making traditional centralized machine learning methods insufficient due to concerns about data availability, computational resources, transfer costs, and especially privacy preservation. A semi-supervised federated learning model was developed to overcome these issues, combining the Shrink Autoencoder and Centroid one-class classifier (SAE-CEN). This approach enhances the performance of intrusion detection by effectively representing normal network data and accurately identifying anomalies in the decentralized strategy. Additionally, a mean square error-based aggregation algorithm (MSEAvg) was introduced to improve global model performance by prioritizing more accurate local models. The results obtained in our experimental setup, which uses various settings relying on the N-BaIoT dataset and Dirichlet distribution, demonstrate significant improvements in real-world heterogeneous IoT networks in detection accuracy from 93.98$\pm$2.90 to 97.30$\pm$0.49, reduced learning costs when requiring only 50\% of gateways participating in the training process, and robustness in large-scale networks.

总结:
本文关注了跨链桥这一促进不同区块链网络间互操作性的关键去中心化应用，由于其涉及线上线下信息协作，面临着更广泛的安全攻击风险。据统计，自2021年以来，针对跨链桥的攻击已导致近43亿美元的损失。因此，理解和检测这类攻击至关重要。文章收集了迄今为止最大的跨链桥攻击事件数据集，共涵盖2021年6月至2024年9月间的49起攻击事件。分析发现，针对跨链业务逻辑的攻击造成的损害远大于非跨链攻击。为了应对此类严重损失及相关研究的稀缺性，本文提出了一种名为BridgeGuard的新工具，用于检测针对跨链业务逻辑的攻击。具体来说，BridgeGuard从图视角建模跨链交易，并采用两阶段检测框架，包括全局和局部图挖掘来识别跨链交易中的攻击模式。实验证明，在包含203笔攻击交易和4万笔正常跨链交易的数据集上，BridgeGuard报告的召回率比现有最先进的工具高出36.32%，并且能够检测未知攻击交易。 <div>

Abstract: Cross-chain bridges are essential decentralized applications (DApps) to facilitate interoperability between different blockchain networks. Unlike regular DApps, the functionality of cross-chain bridges relies on the collaboration of information both on and off the chain, which exposes them to a wider risk of attacks. According to our statistics, attacks on cross-chain bridges have resulted in losses of nearly 4.3 billion dollars since 2021. Therefore, it is particularly necessary to understand and detect attacks on cross-chain bridges. In this paper, we collect the largest number of cross-chain bridge attack incidents to date, including 49 attacks that occurred between June 2021 and September 2024. Our analysis reveal that attacks against cross-chain business logic cause significantly more damage than those that do not. These cross-chain attacks exhibit different patterns compared to normal transactions in terms of call structure, which effectively indicates potential attack behaviors. Given the significant losses in these cases and the scarcity of related research, this paper aims to detect attacks against cross-chain business logic, and propose the BridgeGuard tool. Specifically, BridgeGuard models cross-chain transactions from a graph perspective, and employs a two-stage detection framework comprising global and local graph mining to identify attack patterns in cross-chain transactions. We conduct multiple experiments on the datasets with 203 attack transactions and 40,000 normal cross-chain transactions. The results show that BridgeGuard's reported recall score is 36.32\% higher than that of state-of-the-art tools and can detect unknown attack transactions.

Abstract: This research gives a detailed analysis of the application of blockchain technology to the airline reservation systems in order to bolster trust, transparency, and operational efficiency by overcoming several challenges including customer control and data integrity issues. The study investigates the major components of blockchain technology such as decentralised databases, permanent records of transactions and transactional clauses executed via codes of programs and their impacts on automated systems and real-time tracking of audits. The results show a 30% decrease in booking variations together with greater data synchronization as a result of consensus processes and resistant data formations. The approach to the implementation of a blockchain technology for the purpose of this paper includes many APIs for the automatic multi-faceted record-keeping system including the smart contract execution and controllable end-users approach. Smart contracts organized the processes improving the cycle times by 40% on the average while guaranteeing no breach of agreements. In addition to this, the architecture of the system has no single point failure with over 98% reliability while measures taken to improve security have led to 85% of the customers expressing trust in the services provided. In summation, the results suggest that reservations in the airline sector stand a chance of being redefined with blockchain through savoring the benefits of a single source of truth while attempting to resolve this intrinsic problem of overcomplexity. Although the system improves the experience of customers and the level of operational transparency, issues concerning scalability and regulatory adherence. This research is also a stepping stone for further studies that are intended to address these challenges and more applicable to the airline industry.

Abstract: Cryptocurrencies have gained significant attention in recent years due to their decentralized nature and potential for financial innovation. Thus, the ability to accurately predict its price has become a subject of great interest for investors, traders, and researchers. Some works in the literature show how Bitcoin's market sentiment correlates with its price fluctuations in the market. However, papers that consider the sentiment of the market associated with financial Technical Analysis indicators in order to predict Bitcoin's price are still scarce. In this paper, we present a novel approach for predicting Bitcoin price movements by combining the Fear & Greedy Index, a measure of market sentiment, Technical Analysis indicators, and the potential of Machine Learning algorithms. This work represents a preliminary study on the importance of sentiment metrics in cryptocurrency forecasting. Our initial experiments demonstrate promising results considering investment returns, surpassing the Buy & Hold baseline, and offering valuable insights about the combination of indicators of sentiment and market in a cryptocurrency prediction model.

<title>$\pi$QLB: A Privacy-preserving with Integrity-assuring Query Language for Blockchain</title>

<div> 关键词：区块链、数据查询机制、安全性、隐私保护、$\pi$QLB<br /><br />总结:<br />
本文提出了一个名为$\pi$QLB的新颖区块链查询语言，旨在确保区块链系统中查询输入的机密性和查询结果的完整性。随着区块链技术在不同领域的广泛应用，如医疗系统和供应链管理，对支持安全及隐私保障的数据查询机制的需求日益增长。现有的区块链系统无法满足这一需求，用户需以明文形式提交查询给运营商，这可能导致用户隐私泄露。同时，用户若要验证查询结果的完整性，则需要存储整个区块链数据库并进行本地查询，这种方法成本高昂，不适用于轻量级设备（如智能手机）。为解决这些问题，$\pi$QLB引入了关系数据语义，使区块链数据库能够支持类似于SQL的查询，并利用最新的加密原语——函数秘密分享（FSS）来实现查询输入的机密性。此外，为了保证完整性，$\pi$QLB扩展了传统FSS设置，使得能高效验证FSS结果的正确性，从而让用户能信任没有恶意行为的服务器产生的结果。据作者所知，$\pi$QLB是首个支持机密性、完整性和类似SQL查询功能的区块链数据库查询模型。 <div>

Abstract: The increase in the adoption of blockchain technology in different application domains e.g., healthcare systems, supplychain management, has raised the demand for a data query mechanism on blockchain. Since current blockchain systems lack the support for querying data with embedded security and privacy guarantees, there exists inherent security and privacy concerns on those systems. In particular, existing systems require users to submit queries to blockchain operators (e.g., a node validator) in plaintext. This directly jeopardizes users' privacy as the submitted queries may contain sensitive information, e.g., location or gender preferences, that the users may not be comfortable sharing. On the other hand, currently, the only way for users to ensure integrity of the query result is to maintain the entire blockchain database and perform the queries locally. Doing so incurs high storage and computational costs on the users, precluding this approach to be practically deployable on common light-weight devices (e.g., smartphones). To this end, this paper proposes $\pi$QLB, a query language for blockchain systems that ensures both confidentiality of query inputs and integrity of query results. Additionally, $\pi$QLB enables SQL-like queries over the blockchain data by introducing relational data semantics into the existing blockchain database. $\pi$QLB has applied the recent cryptography primitive, i.e., function secret sharing (FSS), to achieve confidentiality. To support integrity, we extend the traditional FSS setting in such a way that integrity of FSS results can be efficiently verified. Successful verification indicates absence of malicious behaviors on the servers, allowing the user to establish trust from the result. To the best of our knowledge, $\pi$QLB is the first query model designed for blockchain databases with support for confidentiality, integrity, and SQL-like queries.

Abstract: This paper studies decentralized online convex optimization in a networked multi-agent system and proposes a novel algorithm, Learning-Augmented Decentralized Online optimization (LADO), for individual agents to select actions only based on local online information. LADO leverages a baseline policy to safeguard online actions for worst-case robustness guarantees, while staying close to the machine learning (ML) policy for average performance improvement. In stark contrast with the existing learning-augmented online algorithms that focus on centralized settings, LADO achieves strong robustness guarantees in a decentralized setting. We also prove the average cost bound for LADO, revealing the tradeoff between average performance and worst-case robustness and demonstrating the advantage of training the ML policy by explicitly considering the robustness requirement.

<br /><br />总结:
为了解决分布式深度学习(DDL)中因频繁模型同步导致的通信瓶颈和效率问题，本文提出了Federated Dynamic Averaging (FDA)策略。FDA是一种基于模型差异度动态触发同步的通信高效方法，仅当从全局模型初始化的局部模型发生显著偏离时才进行昂贵的同步步骤。每个分布式节点发送少量本地状态信息以辅助该决策。实验表明，与传统和前沿的通信效率算法相比，FDA能大幅降低通信成本并保持在不同数据异质性设置下的稳健性能。 <div>

Abstract: Driven by the ever-growing volume and decentralized nature of data, coupled with the need to harness this data and generate knowledge from it, has led to the extensive use of distributed deep learning (DDL) techniques for training. These techniques rely on local training that is performed at the distributed nodes based on locally collected data, followed by a periodic synchronization process that combines these models to create a global model. However, frequent synchronization of DL models, encompassing millions to many billions of parameters, creates a communication bottleneck, severely hindering scalability. Worse yet, DDL algorithms typically waste valuable bandwidth, and make themselves less practical in bandwidth-constrained federated settings, by relying on overly simplistic, periodic, and rigid synchronization schedules. These drawbacks also have a direct impact on the time required for the training process, necessitating excessive time for data communication. To address these shortcomings, we propose Federated Dynamic Averaging (FDA), a communication-efficient DDL strategy that dynamically triggers synchronization based on the value of the model variance. In essence, the costly synchronization step is triggered only if the local models, which are initialized from a common global model after each synchronization, have significantly diverged. This decision is facilitated by the communication of a small local state from each distributed node/worker. Through extensive experiments across a wide range of learning tasks we demonstrate that FDA reduces communication cost by orders of magnitude, compared to both traditional and cutting-edge communication-efficient algorithms. Additionally, we show that FDA maintains robust performance across diverse data heterogeneity settings.

总结:
本文介绍了Dyna-5G，这是一种针对大规模机器间通信（M2M）网络设计的动态、自组织的5G新无线（5G-NR）网络。传统集中式架构的5G NR网络在支持需要动态、分散通信的应用（如自动驾驶车辆和应急响应无人机群）时面临挑战，因为这些场景常常受到中心化模型单点故障的影响，从而削弱了对关键和全自主应用所需的高度可靠性。Dyna-5G解决了这些问题，允许网络中的每个设备同时充当无线接入网（RAN）、核心网络或用户设备（UE），即使常规基础设施组件受损也能保持网络功能。此外，Dyna-5G内置了专门针对M2M网络的设计机制，如故障恢复和临时加入与退出。通过定制的测试平台模拟实际任务来展示Dyna-5G的性能和可行性，结果显示该网络具有强大的鲁棒性、适应性和快速故障恢复能力，整个网络模型能在最多6秒内完全重新组织，而不影响任务执行。 <div>

Abstract: In this work, we present Dyna-5G, a dynamic, self-organizing 5G New Radio (5G-NR) network designed for massive Machine-to-Machine (M2M) networks. Traditional 5G NR networks, characterized by their centralized architecture, face challenges in supporting applications that require dynamic, decentralized communication, such as autonomous vehicles and drone swarms for emergency responses. These scenarios often suffer from the centralized model's single point of failure, undermining the reliability required in critical and fully autonomous applications. Dyna-5G addresses these challenges by allowing each device in the network to function as either part of the Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network, or as User Equipment (UE), thus maintaining network functionality even when conventional infrastructure components are compromised. Dyna-5G has built-in mechanisms carefully designed specifically for M2M networks, such as failure-recovery and ad-hoc entry and exit. We demonstrate the performance and feasibility of Dyna-5G using a custom-built testbed that simulates real-world missions, demonstrating our network's robustness, adaptability, and failure recovery capabilities. The results indicate that our entire 5G network model can fully re-organize in 6 seconds at maximum, without compromising the mission.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) deployments has necessitated the creation of efficient and secure routing models to manage the massive data traffic generated by interconnected devices & vehicles. For IoV deployments, we propose a novel fan-shaped trust-based routing model with Quality of Service (QoS) and security-aware side-chaining. Our method employs temporal levels of delay, throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), and energy consumption to determine optimal routing paths, thereby ensuring efficient data transmissions. We employ the Bacterial Foraging Optimizer (BFO) algorithm to manage side-chains within the network, which dynamically adjusts side-chain configurations to optimize system performance. The technique of fan-shaped clustering is used to group nodes into efficient clusters, allowing for more efficient communication and resource utilization sets. Extensive experimentation and performance analysis are utilized to evaluate the proposed model. Existing blockchain-based security models have been significantly improved by our findings. Our model achieves a remarkable 9.5% reduction in delay, a 10.5% improvement in throughput, a 2.9% improvement in PDR, and a 4.5% reduction in energy consumption compared to alternative approaches. In addition, we evaluate the model's resistance to Sybil, Masquerading, and Flooding attacks, which are prevalent security threats for IoV deployments. Even under these attack scenarios, our model provides consistently higher QoS levels compared to existing solutions, ensuring uninterrupted and reliable data transmissions. In IoV deployments, the proposed routing model and side-chaining management approach have numerous applications and use-cases like Smart cities, industrial automation, healthcare systems, transportation networks, and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Integrating low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with federated learning (FL) has received widespread attention recently, aiming to adapt pretrained foundation models (FMs) to downstream medical tasks via privacy-preserving decentralized training. However, owing to the direct combination of LoRA and FL, current methods generally undergo two problems, i.e., aggregation deviation, and differential privacy (DP) noise amplification effect. To address these problems, we propose a novel privacy-preserving federated finetuning framework called \underline{D}eviation \underline{E}liminating and Nois\underline{e} \underline{R}egulating (DEeR). Specifically, we firstly theoretically prove that the necessary condition to eliminate aggregation deviation is guaranteing the equivalence between LoRA parameters of clients. Based on the theoretical insight, a deviation eliminator is designed to utilize alternating minimization algorithm to iteratively optimize the zero-initialized and non-zero-initialized parameter matrices of LoRA, ensuring that aggregation deviation always be zeros during training. Furthermore, we also conduct an in-depth analysis of the noise amplification effect and find that this problem is mainly caused by the ``linear relationship'' between DP noise and LoRA parameters. To suppress the noise amplification effect, we propose a noise regulator that exploits two regulator factors to decouple relationship between DP and LoRA, thereby achieving robust privacy protection and excellent finetuning performance. Additionally, we perform comprehensive ablated experiments to verify the effectiveness of the deviation eliminator and noise regulator. DEeR shows better performance on public medical datasets in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/CUHK-AIM-Group/DEeR.

Abstract: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) resemble early online communities, particularly those centered around open-source projects, and present a potential empirical framework for complex social-computing systems by encoding governance rules within "smart contracts" on the blockchain. A key function of a DAO is collective decision-making, typically carried out through a series of proposals where members vote on organizational events using governance tokens, signifying relative influence within the DAO. In just a few years, the deployment of DAOs surged with a total treasury of $24.5 billion and 11.1M governance token holders collectively managing decisions across over 13,000 DAOs as of 2024. In this study, we examine the operational dynamics of 100 DAOs, like pleasrdao, lexdao, lootdao, optimism collective, uniswap, etc. With large-scale empirical analysis of a diverse set of DAO categories and smart contracts and by leveraging on-chain (e.g., voting results) and off-chain data, we examine factors such as voting power, participation, and DAO characteristics dictating the level of decentralization, thus, the efficiency of management structures. As such, our study highlights that increased grassroots participation correlates with higher decentralization in a DAO, and lower variance in voting power within a DAO correlates with a higher level of decentralization, as consistently measured by Gini metrics. These insights closely align with key topics in political science, such as the allocation of power in decision-making and the effects of various governance models. We conclude by discussing the implications for researchers, and practitioners, emphasizing how these factors can inform the design of democratic governance systems in emerging applications that require active engagement from stakeholders in decision-making.

本文研究了联邦学习（FL）与科学机器学习（SciML）的结合，以解决数据分布、隐私和传输问题。文章提出了两种新模型：联邦物理信息神经网络（FedPINN）和联邦深度算子网络（FedDeepONet），并介绍了多种数据生成方法来控制非独立同分布（non-iid）数据的程度。通过使用1-瓦瑟斯坦距离量化函数逼近和偏微分方程（PDE）学习中的数据异质性，系统地探讨了数据异质性与联邦模型性能之间的关系。此外，文章提出了一种权重发散度量，并开发了一个理论框架，以建立联邦学习与传统集中式学习之间权重发散的增长界限。实验结果表明，所提出的联邦方法不仅优于仅使用本地数据训练的模型，而且在准确性上可与使用所有数据训练的集中式模型相媲美。 <div>

Abstract: By leveraging neural networks, the emerging field of scientific machine learning (SciML) offers novel approaches to address complex problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). In practical applications, challenges arise due to the distributed essence of data, concerns about data privacy, or the impracticality of transferring large volumes of data. Federated learning (FL), a decentralized framework that enables the collaborative training of a global model while preserving data privacy, offers a solution to the challenges posed by isolated data pools and sensitive data issues. Here, this paper explores the integration of FL and SciML to approximate complex functions and solve differential equations. We propose two novel models: federated physics-informed neural networks (FedPINN) and federated deep operator networks (FedDeepONet). We further introduce various data generation methods to control the degree of non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data and utilize the 1-Wasserstein distance to quantify data heterogeneity in function approximation and PDE learning. We systematically investigate the relationship between data heterogeneity and federated model performance. Additionally, we propose a measure of weight divergence and develop a theoretical framework to establish growth bounds for weight divergence in federated learning compared to traditional centralized learning. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, we conducted 10 experiments, including 2 on function approximation, 5 PDE problems on FedPINN, and 3 PDE problems on FedDeepONet. These experiments demonstrate that proposed federated methods surpass the models trained only using local data and achieve competitive accuracy of centralized models trained using all data.

Abstract: ZK-Rollups have emerged as a leading solution for blockchain scalability, leveraging succinct proofs primarily based on ZKP protocols. This paper explores the design of transaction fee mechanisms (TFMs) for ZK-Rollups, focusing on how key components like sequencing, data availability~(DA), and ZK proving interact to influence cost structures. We outline the properties that a suitable TFM should possess, such as incentive compatibility and net profitability. In addition, we propose alternatives for TFMs, discuss trade-offs, and highlight open questions that require further investigation in the context of ZK-Rollups.

Abstract: The shift towards decentralized and renewable energy sources has introduced significant challenges to traditional power systems, necessitating innovative market designs. Local energy markets present a viable solution for integrating distributed energy resources such as photovoltaic systems, electric vehicles, and heat pumps within various grid topologies. This study investigates the techno-economic benefits of local energy markets compared to conventional market designs, focusing on their impact on average energy prices and operational peak power, using a self-developed agent-based energy system simulation tool. Through comprehensive simulations across the countryside, rural, suburban, and urban grid topologies with varying penetration levels of the distributed energy resources, totaling 400 simulation setups, we demonstrate that local energy markets can enhance economic efficiency and grid stability with 99 % of the scenarios boasting lower average energy prices and 80 % lower operational peak power levels. Our findings suggest that local energy markets can play a role in the future energy system, especially in areas with high shares of PV and HP, provided that additional infrastructure, management costs, and bureaucratic complexity are kept to a minimum.

Abstract: Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms (PTB-FLA) is a simple FL framework targeting smart Internet of Things in edge systems that provides both generic centralized and decentralized FL algorithms, which implement the corresponding FL orchestration protocols that were formally verified using the process algebra CSP. This approach is appropriate for systems with stationary nodes but cannot be applied to systems with moving nodes. In this paper, we use celestial mechanics to model spacecraft movement, and timed automata (TA) to formalize and verify the centralized FL orchestration protocol, in two phases. In the first phase, we created a conventional TA model to prove traditional properties, namely deadlock freeness and termination. In the second phase, we created a stochastic TA model to prove timing correctness and to estimate termination probability.

Abstract: We propose a new, more potent attack on decentralized exchanges. This attack leverages absolute commitments, which are commitments that can condition on the strategies made by other agents. This attack allows an adversary to charge monopoly prices by committing to undercut those other miners that refuse to charge an even higher fee. This allows the miner to extract the maximum possible price from the user, potentially through side channels that evade the inefficiencies and fees usually incurred. This is considerably more efficient than the prevailing strategy of `sandwich attacks', wherein the adversary induces and profits from fluctuations in the market price to the detriment of users. The attack we propose can, in principle, be realized by the irrevocable and self-executing nature of smart contracts, which are readily available on many major blockchains. Thus, the attack could potentially be used against a decentralized exchange and could drastically reduce the utility of the affected exchange.

Abstract: Recent advancements in building domain-specific large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, especially in tasks requiring reasoning abilities like logical inference over complex relationships and multi-step problem solving. However, creating a powerful all-in-one LLM remains challenging due to the need for proprietary data and vast computational resources. As a resource-friendly alternative, we explore the potential of merging multiple expert models into a single LLM. Existing studies on model merging mainly focus on generalist LLMs instead of domain experts, or the LLMs under the same architecture and size. In this work, we propose an unconstrained model merging framework that accommodates both homogeneous and heterogeneous model architectures with a focus on reasoning tasks. A fine-grained layer-wise weight merging strategy is designed for homogeneous models merging, while heterogeneous model merging is built upon the probabilistic distribution knowledge derived from instruction-response fine-tuning data. Across 7 benchmarks and 9 reasoning-optimized LLMs, we reveal key findings that combinatorial reasoning emerges from merging which surpasses simple additive effects. We propose that unconstrained model merging could serve as a foundation for decentralized LLMs, marking a notable progression from the existing centralized LLM framework. This evolution could enhance wider participation and stimulate additional advancement in the field of artificial intelligence, effectively addressing the constraints posed by centralized models.

Abstract: Depression detection using deep learning models has been widely explored in previous studies, especially due to the large amounts of data available from social media posts. These posts provide valuable information about individuals' mental health conditions and can be leveraged to train models and identify patterns in the data. However, distributed learning approaches have not been extensively explored in this domain. In this study, we adopt Federated Learning (FL) to facilitate decentralized training on smartphones while protecting user data privacy. We train three neural network architectures--GRU, RNN, and LSTM on Reddit posts to detect signs of depression and evaluate their performance under heterogeneous FL settings. To optimize the training process, we leverage a common tokenizer across all client devices, which reduces the computational load. Additionally, we analyze resource consumption and communication costs on smartphones to assess their impact in a real-world FL environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that the federated models achieve comparable performance to the centralized models. This study highlights the potential of FL for decentralized mental health prediction by providing a secure and efficient model training process on edge devices.

Abstract: This paper addresses privacy protection in decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) using Confidential Computing (CC) within the Atoma Network, a decentralized AI platform designed for the Web3 domain. Decentralized AI distributes AI services among multiple entities without centralized oversight, fostering transparency and robustness. However, this structure introduces significant privacy challenges, as sensitive assets such as proprietary models and personal data may be exposed to untrusted participants. Cryptography-based privacy protection techniques such as zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) suffers prohibitive computational overhead. To address the limitation, we propose leveraging Confidential Computing (CC). Confidential Computing leverages hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to provide isolation for processing sensitive data, ensuring that both model parameters and user data remain secure, even in decentralized, potentially untrusted environments. While TEEs face a few limitations, we believe they can bridge the privacy gap in decentralized AI. We explore how we can integrate TEEs into Atoma's decentralized framework.

Abstract: The Lightning Network is a peer-to-peer network designed to address Bitcoin's scalability challenges, facilitating rapid, cost-effective, and instantaneous transactions through bidirectional, blockchain-backed payment channels among network peers. Due to a source-based routing of payments, different pathfinding strategies are used in practice, trading off different objectives for each other such as payment reliability and routing fees. This paper explores differences within pathfinding strategies used by prominent Lightning Network node implementations, which include different underlying cost functions and different constraints, as well as different greedy algorithms of shortest path-type. Surprisingly, we observe that the pathfinding problems that most LN node implementations attempt to solve are NP-complete, and cannot be guaranteed to be optimally solved by the variants of Dijkstra's algorithm currently deployed in production. Through comparative analysis and simulations, we evaluate efficacy of different pathfinding strategies across metrics such as success rate, fees, path length, and timelock. Our experiments indicate that the strategies used by LND tend to be advantageous in terms of payment reliability, Eclair tends to result in paths with low fees, and that LDK exhibits average reliability with larger fee levels for smaller payment amounts; furthermore, CLN stands out for its minimal timelock paths. Additionally, we investigate the impact of Lightning node connectivity levels on routing efficiency. The findings of our analysis provide insights towards future improvements of pathfinding strategies and algorithms used within the Lightning Network.

Abstract: In recent years, researchers in the software security field have focused on detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts to avoid significant losses of crypto assets on the blockchain. Despite early successes in this domain, detecting developers' intents in smart contracts is a more pressing issue, as malicious intents have resulted in substantial financial losses. Unfortunately, existing research lacks effective methods for detecting development intents in smart contracts. To address this gap, we propose \textsc{SmartIntentNN} (Smart Contract Intent Neural Network), a deep learning model designed to automatically detect development intent in smart contracts. \textsc{SmartIntentNN} utilizes a pre-trained sentence encoder to generate contextual representations of smart contract code, a K-means clustering model to identify and highlight prominent intent features, and a bidirectional LSTM-based deep neural network for multi-label classification. We trained and evaluated \textsc{SmartIntentNN} on a dataset comprising over 40,000 real-world smart contracts, employing self-comparison baselines in our experimental setup. The results demonstrate that \textsc{SmartIntentNN} achieves an F1-score of 0.8633 in identifying intents across 10 distinct categories, outperforming all baselines and filling the gap in smart contract detection by incorporating intent analysis.

Abstract: Airdrops are a common strategy used by blockchain protocols to attract and grow an initial user base. Tokens are typically distributed to select users as a "reward" for engaging with the protocol, aiming to foster long-term community loyalty and sustained economic activity. Despite their prevalence, there is limited understanding of what makes an airdrop successful. This paper outlines the design space for airdrops and proposes key outcomes for an effective strategy. We analyze on-chain data from six large-scale airdrops to assess their success and find that a substantial portion of tokens is often sold off by "airdrop farmers." Based on this analysis, we highlight common pitfalls and offer guidelines for improving airdrop design.

Abstract: With the rise of "Metaverse" and "Web 3.0", Non-Fungible Token (NFT) has emerged as a kind of pivotal digital asset, garnering significant attention. By the end of March 2024, more than 1.7 billion NFTs have been minted across various blockchain platforms. To effectively locate a desired NFT, conducting searches within a vast array of NFTs is essential. The challenge in NFT retrieval is heightened due to the high degree of similarity among different NFTs, regarding regional and semantic aspects. In this paper, we will introduce a benchmark dataset named "NFT Top1000 Visual-Text Dataset" (NFT1000), containing 7.56 million image-text pairs, and being collected from 1000 most famous PFP1 NFT collections2 by sales volume on the Ethereum blockchain. Based on this dataset and leveraging the CLIP series of pre-trained models as our foundation, we propose the dynamic masking fine-tuning scheme. This innovative approach results in a 7.4\% improvement in the top1 accuracy rate, while utilizing merely 13\% of the total training data (0.79 million vs. 6.1 million). We also propose a robust metric Comprehensive Variance Index (CVI) to assess the similarity and retrieval difficulty of visual-text pairs data. The dataset will be released as an open-source resource. For more details, please refer to: https://github.com/ShuxunoO/NFT-Net.git.

Abstract: Although rollups have attracted significant attention, there is limited empirical research on their performance under high load. To address this, we present a data-driven analysis of the transaction surge in late 2023 and early 2024, attributed to inscriptions -- a method for recording data on the blockchain. Initially introduced on Bitcoin, inscriptions enable the representation of NFTs or ERC-20-like tokens without smart contracts, and have since expanded to other blockchains. This paper examines inscription-related transactions on Ethereum and major EVM-compatible rollups, assessing their impact on scalability during transaction surges. Our results show that, on certain days, inscriptions accounted nearly 90% of transactions on Arbitrum and ZKsync Era, while 53% on Ethereum, with 99% of these inscriptions involving meme coin minting. Furthermore, we show that ZKsync and Arbitrum saw lower median gas fees during these surges. ZKsync Era, a ZK-rollup, showed a greater fee reduction than the optimistic rollups studied -- Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism.

本文研究了Layer-2（L2）区块链上的非原子MEV（最大可提取价值），通过测量跨Rollup和DEX-CEX之间的套利机会来量化。近年来，交易活动从以太坊转向Rollups，尽管Rollups上的交易量较低，但其频率更高。文章分析了L2上的交易成本和跨Rollup与DEX-CEX的价格差异，发现超过500,000次未被利用的套利机会。这些机会平均持续10到20个区块，需要修改LVR（损失对再平衡）指标以避免重复计算。研究发现，Arbitrum、Base和Optimism的套利机会占交易量的0.03%至0.05%，而ZKsync的套利机会波动在0.25%左右。 <div>

Abstract: This study quantifies the potential non-atomic MEV on Layer-2 (L2) blockchains by measuring the arbitrage opportunities between cross-rollup and DEX-CEX. Over recent years, we observe a shift in trading activities from Ethereum to rollups, with swaps on rollups occurring 2-3 times more frequently, albeit with lower trade volumes. By analyzing the costs of swap on L2s and price discrepancies cross-rollup and DEX-CEX, we identify more than 500 000 unexplored arbitrage opportunities. In particular, we find that these opportunities persist, on average, for 10 to 20 blocks, necessitating the modification of the Loss Versus Rebalancing (LVR) metric to prevent double-counting. Our findings indicate that the arbitrage opportunities in Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism range between 0.03% and 0.05% of the trading volume, while in the ZKsync it fluctuates around 0.25%.

Abstract: Decentralized training of deep neural networks has attracted significant attention for its theoretically superior scalability over synchronous data-parallel methods like All-Reduce. However, realizing this potential in multi-node training is challenging due to the complex design space that involves communication topologies, computation patterns, and optimization algorithms. This paper identifies three key factors that can lead to speedups over All-Reduce training and constructs a runtime model to determine when, how, and to what degree decentralization can yield shorter per-iteration runtimes. Furthermore, to support the decentralized training of transformer-based models, we study a decentralized Adam algorithm that allows for overlapping communications and computations, prove its convergence, and propose an accumulation technique to mitigate the high variance caused by small local batch sizes. We deploy the proposed approach in clusters with up to 64 GPUs and demonstrate its practicality and advantages in both runtime and generalization performance under a fixed iteration budget.

Abstract: We study a decentralized version of Moving Agents in Formation (MAiF), a variant of Multi-Agent Path Finding aiming to plan collision-free paths for multiple agents with the dual objectives of reaching their goals quickly while maintaining a desired formation. The agents must balance these objectives under conditions of partial observation and limited communication. The formation maintenance depends on the joint state of all agents, whose dimensionality increases exponentially with the number of agents, rendering the learning process intractable. Additionally, learning a single policy that can accommodate different linear preferences for these two objectives presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose Mean-Field Control with Envelop $Q$-learning (MFC-EQ), a scalable and adaptable learning framework for this bi-objective multi-agent problem. We approximate the dynamics of all agents using mean-field theory while learning a universal preference-agnostic policy through envelop $Q$-learning. Our empirical evaluation of MFC-EQ across numerous instances shows that it outperforms state-of-the-art centralized MAiF baselines. Furthermore, MFC-EQ effectively handles more complex scenarios where the desired formation changes dynamically -- a challenge that existing MAiF planners cannot address.

Abstract: This paper introduces Proof of Team Sprint (PoTS), a novel consensus algorithm designed to address the significant energy inefficiencies inherent in traditional Proof of Work (PoW) systems. PoTS shifts the consensus mechanism from an individual competition model to a collaborative team-based approach. Participants are organized into groups, with each group collaboratively working to solve cryptographic puzzles required to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. This collaborative approach significantly reduces the overall energy consumption of the network while maintaining high levels of security and decentralization. Our analysis shows that PoTS can reduce energy consumption by a factor of 1/N, where N is the number of participants in each group, compared to PoW. Furthermore, PoTS maintains a fair and equitable reward distribution among participants, ensuring continued engagement and network integrity. The paper also discusses the scalability, security implications, and potential challenges of adopting PoTS, positioning it as a promising alternative for sustainable blockchain technology.

Abstract: Zero-knowledge layer 2 protocols emerge as a compelling approach to overcoming blockchain scalability issues by processing transactions through the transaction finalization process. During this process, transactions are efficiently processed off the main chain. Besides, both the transaction data and the zero-knowledge proofs of transaction executions are reserved on the main chain, ensuring the availability of transaction data as well as the correctness and verifiability of transaction executions. Hence, any bugs that cause the transaction finalization failure are crucial, as they impair the usability of these protocols and the scalability of blockchains.
  In this work, we conduct the first systematic study on finalization failure bugs in zero-knowledge layer 2 protocols, and define two kinds of such bugs. Besides, we design fAmulet, the first tool to detect finalization failure bugs in Polygon zkRollup, a prominent zero-knowledge layer 2 protocol, by leveraging fuzzing testing. To trigger finalization failure bugs effectively, we introduce a finalization behavior model to guide our transaction fuzzer to generate and mutate transactions for inducing diverse behaviors across each component (e.g., Sequencer) in the finalization process. Moreover, we define bug oracles according to the distinct bug definitions to accurately detect bugs. Through our evaluation, fAmulet can uncover twelve zero-day finalization failure bugs in Polygon zkRollup, and cover at least 20.8% more branches than baselines. Furthermore, through our preliminary study, fAmulet uncovers a zero-day finalization failure bug in Scroll zkRollup, highlighting the generality of fAmulet to be applied to other zero-knowledge layer 2 protocols. At the time of writing, all our uncovered bugs have been confirmed and fixed by Polygon zkRollup and Scroll zkRollup teams.

Abstract: Temporal graph clustering is a complex task that involves discovering meaningful structures in dynamic graphs where relationships and entities change over time. Existing methods typically require centralized data collection, which poses significant privacy and communication challenges. In this work, we introduce a novel Federated Temporal Graph Clustering (FTGC) framework that enables decentralized training of graph neural networks (GNNs) across multiple clients, ensuring data privacy throughout the process. Our approach incorporates a temporal aggregation mechanism to effectively capture the evolution of graph structures over time and a federated optimization strategy to collaboratively learn high-quality clustering representations. By preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead, our framework achieves competitive performance on temporal graph datasets, making it a promising solution for privacy-sensitive, real-world applications involving dynamic data.

Abstract: Ethereum, as a representative of Web3, adopts a novel framework called Proposer Builder Separation (PBS) to prevent the centralization of block profits in the hands of institutional Ethereum stakers. Introducing builders to generate blocks based on public transactions, PBS aims to ensure that block profits are distributed among all stakers. Through the auction among builders, only one will win the block in each slot. Ideally, the equilibrium strategy of builders under public information would lead them to bid all block profits. However, builders are now capable of extracting profits from private order flows. In this paper, we explore the effect of PBS with private order flows. Specifically, we propose the asymmetry auction model of MEV-Boost auction. Moreover, we conduct empirical study on Ethereum blocks from January 2023 to May 2024. Our analysis indicates that private order flows contribute to 54.59% of the block value, indicating that different builders will build blocks with different valuations. Interestingly, we find that builders with more private order flows (i.e., higher block valuations) are more likely to win the block, while retain larger proportion of profits. In return, such builders will further attract more private order flows, resulting in a monopolistic market gradually. Our findings reveal that PBS in current stage is unable to balance the profit distribution, which just transits the centralization of block profits from institutional stakers to the monopolistic builder.

Abstract: In recent years, blockchain oracle, as the key link between blockchain and real-world data interaction, has greatly expanded the application scope of blockchain. In particular, the emergence of the Multi-Data Source (MDS) oracle has greatly improved the reliability of the oracle in the case of untrustworthy data sources. However, the current MDS oracle scheme requires nodes to obtain data redundantly from multiple data sources to guarantee data reliability, which greatly increases the resource overhead and response time of the system. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Secure and Efficient Multi-data Source Oracle framework (SEMSO), which nodes only need to access one data source to ensure the reliability of final data. First, we design a new off-chain data aggregation protocol TBLS, to guarantee data source diversity and reliability at low cost. Second, according to the rational man assumption, the data source selection task of nodes is modeled and solved based on the Bayesian game under incomplete information to maximize the node's revenue while improving the success rate of TBLS aggregation and system response speed. Security analysis verifies the reliability of the proposed scheme, and experiments show that under the same environmental assumptions, SEMSO takes into account data diversity while reducing the response time by 23.5\%.

Abstract: We consider the problem of decomposing a global task assigned to a multi-agent system, expressed as a formula within a fragment of Signal Temporal Logic (STL), under range-limited communication. Given a global task expressed as a conjunction of local tasks defined over the individual and relative states of agents in the system, we propose representing task dependencies among agents as edges of a suitably defined task graph. At the same time, range-limited communication naturally induces the definition of a communication graph that defines which agents have access to each other's states. Within these settings, inconsistencies arise when a task dependency between a pair of agents is not supported by a corresponding communication link due to the limited communication range. As a result, state feedback control laws previously derived to achieve the tasks' satisfaction can not be leveraged. We propose a task decomposition mechanism to distribute tasks assigned to pairs of non-communicating agents in the system as conjunctions of tasks defined over the relative states of communicating agents, thus enforcing consistency between task and communication graphs. Assuming the super-level sets of the predicate functions composing the STL tasks are bounded polytopes, our task decomposition mechanism can be cast as a parameter optimization problem and solved via state-of-the-art decentralized convex optimization algorithms. To guarantee the soundness of our approach, we present various conditions under which the tasks defined in the applied STL fragment are unsatisfiable, and we show sufficient conditions such that our decomposition approach yields satisfiable global tasks after decomposition.

Abstract: To alleviate hardware scarcity in training large deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly large language models (LLMs), we present FusionLLM, a decentralized training system designed and implemented for training DNNs using geo-distributed GPUs across different computing clusters or individual devices. Decentralized training faces significant challenges regarding system design and efficiency, including: 1) the need for remote automatic differentiation (RAD), 2) support for flexible model definitions and heterogeneous software, 3) heterogeneous hardware leading to low resource utilization or the straggler problem, and 4) slow network communication. To address these challenges, in the system design, we represent the model as a directed acyclic graph of operators (OP-DAG). Each node in the DAG represents the operator in the DNNs, while the edge represents the data dependency between operators. Based on this design, 1) users are allowed to customize any DNN without caring low-level operator implementation; 2) we enable the task scheduling with the more fine-grained sub-tasks, offering more optimization space; 3) a DAG runtime executor can implement RAD withour requiring the consistent low-level ML framework versions.
  To enhance system efficiency, we implement a workload estimator and design an OP-Fence scheduler to cluster devices with similar bandwidths together and partition the DAG to increase throughput. Additionally, we propose an AdaTopK compressor to adaptively compress intermediate activations and gradients at the slowest communication links. To evaluate the convergence and efficiency of our system and algorithms, we train ResNet-101 and GPT-2 on three real-world testbeds using 48 GPUs connected with 8 Mbps~10 Gbps networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our system and method can achieve 1.45 - 9.39x speedup compared to baseline methods while ensuring convergence.

Abstract: Intersections are essential road infrastructures for traffic in modern metropolises. However, they can also be the bottleneck of traffic flows as a result of traffic incidents or the absence of traffic coordination mechanisms such as traffic lights. Recently, various control and coordination mechanisms that are beyond traditional control methods have been proposed to improve the efficiency of intersection traffic. Amongst these methods, the control of foreseeable mixed traffic that consists of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and robot vehicles (RVs) has emerged. In this project, we propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for the control and coordination of mixed traffic at real-world, complex intersections--a topic that has not been previously explored. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, we show that using 5% RVs, we can prevent congestion formation inside a complex intersection under the actual traffic demand of 700 vehicles per hour. In contrast, without RVs, congestion starts to develop when the traffic demand reaches as low as 200 vehicles per hour. When there exist more than 60% RVs in traffic, our method starts to achieve comparable or even better performance to traffic signals on the average waiting time of all vehicles at the intersection. Our method is also robust against both blackout events and sudden RV percentage drops, and enjoys excellent generalizablility, which is illustrated by its successful deployment in two unseen intersections.

Abstract: As a trusted middleware connecting the blockchain and the real world, the blockchain oracle can obtain trusted real-time price information for financial applications such as payment and settlement, and asset valuation on the blockchain. However, the current oracle schemes face the dilemma of security and service quality in the process of node selection, and the implicit interest relationship in financial applications leads to a significant conflict of interest between the task publisher and the executor, which reduces the participation enthusiasm of both parties and system security. Therefore, this paper proposes an anonymous node selection scheme that anonymously selects nodes with high reputations to participate in tasks to ensure the security and service quality of nodes. Then, this paper also details the interest requirements and behavioral motives of all parties in the payment settlement and asset valuation scenarios. Under the hypothesis of rational man, an incentive mechanism based on the Stackelberg game is proposed. It can achieve equilibrium under the pursuit of the revenue of task publishers and executors, thereby ensuring the revenue of all types of users and improving the enthusiasm for participation. Finally, we verify the security of the proposed scheme through security analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the variance of obtaining price data by about 55\% while ensuring security, and meeting the revenue of all parties.

Abstract: Autonomous robot operation in unstructured environments is often underpinned by spatial understanding through vision. Systems composed of multiple concurrently operating robots additionally require access to frequent, accurate and reliable pose estimates. In this work, we propose CoViS-Net, a decentralized visual spatial foundation model that learns spatial priors from data, enabling pose estimation as well as spatial comprehension. Our model is fully decentralized, platform-agnostic, executable in real-time using onboard compute, and does not require existing networking infrastructure. CoViS-Net provides relative pose estimates and a local bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation, even without camera overlap between robots (in contrast to classical methods). We demonstrate its use in a multi-robot formation control task across various real-world settings. We provide code, models and supplementary material online. https://proroklab.github.io/CoViS-Net/

This work addresses safe motion planning for collaborative manipulation of an unknown payload on discrete terrain while avoiding obstacles. Our approach uses two sets of model predictive controllers (MPCs) as motion planners: a global MPC generates a safe trajectory for the team with obstacle avoidance, while decentralized MPCs for each robot ensure safe footholds on discrete terrain as they follow the global trajectory. A model reference adaptive whole-body controller (MRA-WBC) then tracks the desired path, compensating for model uncertainties from the unknown payload. We validated our method in simulation and hardware on a team of Unitree robots. The results demonstrate that our approach successfully guides the team through obstacle courses, requiring planar positioning and height adjustments, and all happening on discrete terrain such as stepping stones.

Abstract: In scenarios where a seller holds sensitive data $x$, like patient records, and a buyer seeks to obtain an evaluation of a function $f$ on $x$, solutions in trustless environments like blockchain fall into two categories: (1) Smart contract-powered solutions and (2) cryptographic solutions using tools such as adaptor signatures. The former offers atomic transactions where the buyer learns $f(x)$ upon payment. However, this approach is inefficient, costly, lacks privacy for the seller's data, and is incompatible with blockchains such as bitcoin. In contrast, the adaptor signature-based approach addresses all of the above issues but comes with an "all-or-nothing" guarantee, where the buyer fully extracts $x$ and does not support extracting $f(x)$. In this work, we bridge the gap between these approaches, developing a solution that enables fair functional sales while offering all the above properties like adaptor signatures.
  Towards this, we propose functional adaptor signatures (FAS), a novel cryptographic primitive and show how it can be used to enable functional sales. We formalize the security properties of FAS, among which is a new notion called witness privacy to capture seller's privacy, which ensures the buyer does not learn anything beyond $f(x)$. We present multiple variants of witness privacy, namely, witness hiding, witness indistinguishability, and zero-knowledge.
  We introduce two efficient constructions of FAS supporting linear functions based on groups of prime-order and lattices, that satisfy the strongest notion of witness privacy. A central conceptual contribution of our work lies in revealing a surprising connection between functional encryption and adaptor signatures. We implement our FAS construction for Schnorr signatures and show that for reasonably sized seller witnesses, all operations are quite efficient even for commodity hardware.

Abstract: The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) offers significant potential for ocean exploration but encounters challenges due to dynamic underwater environments and severe signal attenuation. Current methods relying on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) based on online reinforcement learning (RL) lead to high computational costs and low data utilization. To address these issues and the constraints of turbulent ocean environments, we propose a multi-AUV assisted data collection framework for IoUT based on multi-agent offline RL. This framework maximizes data rate and the value of information (VoI), minimizes energy consumption, and ensures collision avoidance by utilizing environmental and equipment status data. We introduce a semi-communication decentralized training with decentralized execution (SC-DTDE) paradigm and a multi-agent independent conservative Q-learning algorithm (MAICQL) to effectively tackle the problem. Extensive simulations demonstrate the high applicability, robustness, and data collection efficiency of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Decentralized learning has become crucial for collaborative model training in environments where data privacy and trust are paramount. In web-based applications, clients are liberated from traditional fixed network topologies, enabling the establishment of arbitrary peer-to-peer (P2P) connections. While this flexibility is highly promising, it introduces a fundamental challenge: the optimal selection of neighbors to ensure effective collaboration. To address this, we introduce WPFed, a fully decentralized, web-based learning framework designed to enable globally optimal neighbor selection. WPFed employs a dynamic communication graph and a weighted neighbor selection mechanism. By assessing inter-client similarity through Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and evaluating model quality based on peer rankings, WPFed enables clients to identify personalized optimal neighbors on a global scale while preserving data privacy. To enhance security and deter malicious behavior, WPFed integrates verification mechanisms for both LSH codes and performance rankings, leveraging blockchain-driven announcements to ensure transparency and verifiability. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate that WPFed significantly improves learning outcomes and system robustness compared to traditional federated learning methods. Our findings highlight WPFed's potential to facilitate effective and secure decentralized collaborative learning across diverse and interconnected web environments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising machine learning paradigm that collaborates with client models to capture global knowledge. However, deploying FL models in real-world scenarios remains unreliable due to the coexistence of in-distribution data and unexpected out-of-distribution (OOD) data, such as covariate-shift and semantic-shift data. Current FL researches typically address either covariate-shift data through OOD generalization or semantic-shift data via OOD detection, overlooking the simultaneous occurrence of various OOD shifts. In this work, we propose FOOGD, a method that estimates the probability density of each client and obtains reliable global distribution as guidance for the subsequent FL process. Firstly, SM3D in FOOGD estimates score model for arbitrary distributions without prior constraints, and detects semantic-shift data powerfully. Then SAG in FOOGD provides invariant yet diverse knowledge for both local covariate-shift generalization and client performance generalization. In empirical validations, FOOGD significantly enjoys three main advantages: (1) reliably estimating non-normalized decentralized distributions, (2) detecting semantic shift data via score values, and (3) generalizing to covariate-shift data by regularizing feature extractor. The prejoct is open in https://github.com/XeniaLLL/FOOGD-main.git.

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi), in which digital assets are exchanged without trusted intermediaries, has grown rapidly in value in recent years. The global DeFi ecosystem is fragmented into multiple blockchains, fueling the demand for cross-chain commerce. Existing approaches for cross-chain transactions, e.g., bridges and cross-chain deals, achieve atomicity by locking assets in escrow. However, locking up assets increases the financial risks for the participants, especially due to price fluctuations and the long latency of cross-chain transactions. Stablecoins, which are pegged to a non-volatile asset such as the US dollar, help mitigate the risk associated with price fluctuations. However, existing stablecoin designs are tied to individual blockchain platforms, and trusted parties or complex protocols are needed to exchange stablecoin tokens between blockchains.
  Our goal is to design a practical stablecoin for cross-chain commerce. Realizing this goal requires addressing two challenges. The first challenge is to support a large and growing number of blockchains efficiently. The second challenge is to be resilient to price fluctuations and blockchain platform failures. We present CroCoDai to address these challenges. We also present three prototype implementations of our stablecoin system, and show that it incurs small execution overhead.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of smart devices coupled with the advent of 6G networks has profoundly reshaped the domain of collaborative machine learning. Alongside growing privacy-security concerns in sensitive fields, these developments have positioned federated learning (FL) as a pivotal technology for decentralized model training. Despite its vast potential, specially in the age of complex foundation models, FL encounters challenges such as elevated communication costs, computational constraints, and the complexities of non-IID data distributions. We introduce AutoFLIP, an innovative approach that utilizes a federated loss exploration phase to drive adaptive hybrid pruning, operating in a structured and unstructured way. This innovative mechanism automatically identifies and prunes model substructure by distilling knowledge on model gradients behavior across different non-IID client losses topology, thereby optimizing computational efficiency and enhancing model performance on resource constrained scenarios. Extensive experiments on various datasets and FL tasks reveal that AutoFLIP not only efficiently accelerates global convergence, but also achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods. On average, AutoFLIP reduces computational overhead by 48.8% and communication costs by 35.5%, while improving global accuracy. By significantly reducing these overheads, AutoFLIP offer the way for efficient FL deployment in real-world applications for a scalable and broad applicability.

Abstract: This paper investigates the evolving relationship between protecting Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) and blockchain technology. We conducted a comprehensive literature review, supplemented by case study analyses and research paper reviews, to understand the scope and implications of blockchain about intellectual property rights. Our study demonstrates how applying blockchain technology for IPR could revolutionize transparency, security, and operational efficiency. It also identifies the primary challenges and openings in this area. We provide an extensive framework for integrating blockchain technology with intellectual property rights and other technical components (some of which already exist or are resolved by blockchain; some might need attention), drawing on current research and best practices. This framework has the potential to give a new perspective in a structured manner for the intellectual property landscape by providing 360-degree coverage across different layers of operation.

本文提出了一种名为RevTrack的框架，旨在通过跟踪资金的初始发送者和最终接收者来实现大规模的反洗钱（AML）分析，从而降低成本并提高准确性。RevTrack的核心理念在于识别资金流动的起点和终点，以此作为判断其所属子图性质的关键指标。

Abstract: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) involves the identification of money laundering crimes in financial activities, such as cryptocurrency transactions. Recent studies advanced AML through the lens of graph-based machine learning, modeling the web of financial transactions as a graph and developing graph methods to identify suspicious activities. For instance, a recent effort on opensourcing datasets and benchmarks, Elliptic2, treats a set of Bitcoin addresses, considered to be controlled by the same entity, as a graph node and transactions among entities as graph edges. This modeling reveals the "shape" of a money laundering scheme - a subgraph on the blockchain. Despite the attractive subgraph classification results benchmarked by the paper, competitive methods remain expensive to apply due to the massive size of the graph; moreover, existing methods require candidate subgraphs as inputs which may not be available in practice. In this work, we introduce RevTrack, a graph-based framework that enables large-scale AML analysis with a lower cost and a higher accuracy. The key idea is to track the initial senders and the final receivers of funds; these entities offer a strong indication of the nature (licit vs. suspicious) of their respective subgraph. Based on this framework, we propose RevClassify, which is a neural network model for subgraph classification. Additionally, we address the practical problem where subgraph candidates are not given, by proposing RevFilter. This method identifies new suspicious subgraphs by iteratively filtering licit transactions, using RevClassify. Benchmarking these methods on Elliptic2, a new standard for AML, we show that RevClassify outperforms state-of-the-art subgraph classification techniques in both cost and accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RevFilter in discovering new suspicious subgraphs, confirming its utility for practical AML.

Abstract: Rapid search and rescue is critical to maximizing survival rates following natural disasters. However, these efforts are challenged by the need to search large disaster zones, lack of reliability in the communications infrastructure, and a priori unknown numbers of objects of interest (OOIs), such as injured survivors. Aerial robots are increasingly being deployed for search and rescue due to their high mobility, but there remains a gap in deploying multi-robot autonomous aerial systems for methodical search of large environments. Prior works have relied on preprogrammed paths from human operators or are evaluated only in simulation. We bridge these gaps in the state of the art by developing and demonstrating a decentralized active search system, which biases its trajectories to take additional views of uncertain OOIs. The methodology leverages stochasticity for rapid coverage in communication denied scenarios. When communications are available, robots share poses, goals, and OOI information to accelerate the rate of search. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments in Bloomingdale, OH, are conducted to validate the approach. The results demonstrate the active search approach outperforms greedy coverage-based planning in communication-denied scenarios while maintaining comparable performance in communication-enabled scenarios.

Abstract: Mobile robots rely on maps to navigate through an environment. In the absence of any map, the robots must build the map online from partial observations as they move in the environment. Traditional methods build a map using only direct observations. In contrast, humans identify patterns in the observed environment and make informed guesses about what to expect ahead. Modeling these patterns explicitly is difficult due to the complexity of the environments. However, these complex models can be approximated well using learning-based methods in conjunction with large training data. By extracting patterns, robots can use direct observations and predictions of what lies ahead to better navigate an unknown environment. In this dissertation, we present several learning-based methods to equip mobile robots with prediction capabilities for efficient and safer operation. In the first part of the dissertation, we learn to predict using geometrical and structural patterns in the environment. Partially observed maps provide invaluable cues for accurately predicting the unobserved areas. We first demonstrate the capability of general learning-based approaches to model these patterns for a variety of overhead map modalities. Then we employ task-specific learning for faster navigation in indoor environments by predicting 2D occupancy in the nearby regions. This idea is further extended to 3D point cloud representation for object reconstruction. Predicting the shape of the full object from only partial views, our approach paves the way for efficient next-best-view planning.
  In the second part of the dissertation, we learn to predict using spatiotemporal patterns in the environment. We focus on dynamic tasks such as target tracking and coverage where we seek decentralized coordination between robots. We first show how graph neural networks can be used for more scalable and faster inference.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of medical informatics, a wealth of valuable personal health records (PHR) has been generated. Concurrently, blockchain technology has enhanced the security of medical institutions. However, these institutions often function as isolated data silos, limiting the potential value of PHRs. As the demand for data sharing between hospitals on different blockchains grows, addressing the challenge of cross-chain data sharing becomes crucial. When sharing PHRs across blockchains, the limited storage and computational capabilities of medical Internet of Things (IoT) devices complicate the storage of large volumes of PHRs and the handling of complex calculations. Additionally, varying blockchain cryptosystems and the risk of internal attacks further complicate the cross-chain sharing of PHRs. This paper proposes a scheme for sharing PHRs across heterogeneous and interoperable blockchains. Medical IoT devices can encrypt and store real-time PHRs in an InterPlanetary File System, requiring only simple operations for data sharing. An enhanced proxy re-encryption(PRE) algorithm addresses the differences in blockchain cryptosystems. Multi-dimensional analysis demonstrates that this scheme offers robust security and excellent performance.

Abstract: We propose new algorithms to efficiently average a collection of points on a Grassmannian manifold in both the centralized and decentralized settings. Grassmannian points are used ubiquitously in machine learning, computer vision, and signal processing to represent data through (often low-dimensional) subspaces. While averaging these points is crucial to many tasks (especially in the decentralized setting), existing methods unfortunately remain computationally expensive due to the non-Euclidean geometry of the manifold. Our proposed algorithms, Rapid Grassmannian Averaging (RGrAv) and Decentralized Rapid Grassmannian Averaging (DRGrAv), overcome this challenge by leveraging the spectral structure of the problem to rapidly compute an average using only small matrix multiplications and QR factorizations. We provide a theoretical guarantee of optimality and present numerical experiments which demonstrate that our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods in providing high accuracy solutions in minimal time. Additional experiments showcase the versatility of our algorithms to tasks such as K-means clustering on video motion data, establishing RGrAv and DRGrAv as powerful tools for generic Grassmannian averaging.

总结:
本文提出了一种名为DFedCata的加速分布式联邦学习算法，以解决分布式联邦学习中数据异质性导致的模型聚合方差增大、训练收敛速度慢和测试泛化性能差的问题。DFedCata由两个主要组件组成：Moreau envelope函数，用于解决由数据异质性引起客户端参数不一致的问题；以及Nesterov的外推步骤，用于加速聚合阶段。理论分析证明了算法的优化误差界和泛化误差界，为算法的性质提供了更深入的理解，并从理论上探讨了超参数选择。实验结果显示，DFedCata在CIFAR10/100上不同非iid数据分布下，不仅在收敛速度上有优势，而且在泛化性能上也表现出色。此外，实验证实了DFedCata的理论特性。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning has emerged as an alternative to centralized architectures due to its faster training, privacy preservation, and reduced communication overhead. In decentralized communication, the server aggregation phase in Centralized Federated Learning shifts to the client side, which means that clients connect with each other in a peer-to-peer manner. However, compared to the centralized mode, data heterogeneity in Decentralized Federated Learning will cause larger variances between aggregated models, which leads to slow convergence in training and poor generalization performance in tests. To address these issues, we introduce Catalyst Acceleration and propose an acceleration Decentralized Federated Learning algorithm called DFedCata. It consists of two main components: the Moreau envelope function, which primarily addresses parameter inconsistencies among clients caused by data heterogeneity, and Nesterov's extrapolation step, which accelerates the aggregation phase. Theoretically, we prove the optimization error bound and generalization error bound of the algorithm, providing a further understanding of the nature of the algorithm and the theoretical perspectives on the hyperparameter choice. Empirically, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm in both convergence speed and generalization performance on CIFAR10/100 with various non-iid data distributions. Furthermore, we also experimentally verify the theoretical properties of DFedCata.

<div> 关键词：交易费机制设计、矿工、用户、协同策略、不可离链影响证明

总结:

本文探讨了区块链中由不信任的矿工运行的交易纳入拍卖机制的设计。首先，作者提出了一种新的评估标准——“不可离链影响证明”，指出了在当前的评估标准下，以太坊改进提案EIP-1559并不能满足这一要求。因为一个能够最大化预期收益的矿工可能会通过威胁离链转移资金给其增加额外收入来误导竞标者。

其次，文章重新审视了基于多方计算的第二价格拍卖机制，虽然该机制不符合前文提出的“简单对矿工”的标准，但作者发现，如果允许矿工直接设定保留价，该机制不仅能满足“简单对用户和矿工”的条件，还能满足“不可离链影响证明”的要求。

最后，文章指出，要同时满足所有已考虑的属性以及“不可离链影响证明”这一新标准，即使在供给无限的情况下，甚至在向矿工征询意见后，也没有任何机制能实现这一目标。这表明在设计交易费机制时需要权衡多种因素，包括安全性、公平性以及操作的复杂性。 <div>

Abstract: Transaction Fee Mechanism Design studies auctions run by untrusted miners for transaction inclusion in a blockchain. Under previously-considered desiderata, an auction is considered `good' if, informally-speaking, each party (i.e., the miner, the users, and coalitions of both miners and users) has no incentive to deviate from the fixed and pre-determined protocol.
  In this paper, we propose a novel desideratum for transaction fee mechanisms. We say that a TFM is off-chain influence proof when the miner cannot achieve additional revenue by running a separate auction off-chain. While the previously-highlighted EIP-1559 is the gold-standard according to prior desiderata, we show that it does not satisfy off-chain influence proofness. Intuitively, this holds because a Bayesian revenue-maximizing miner can strictly increase profits by persuasively threatening to censor any bids that do not transfer a tip directly to the miner off-chain.
  On the other hand, we reconsider the Cryptographic (multi-party computation assisted) Second Price Auction mechanism, which is technically not `simple for miners' according to previous desiderata (since miners may wish to set a reserve by fabricating bids). We show that, in a slightly different model where the miner is allowed to set the reserve directly, this auction satisfies simplicity for users and miners, and off-chain influence proofness.
  Finally, we prove a strong impossibility result: no mechanism satisfies all previously-considered properties along with off-chain influence proofness, even with unlimited supply, and even after soliciting input from the miner.

Abstract: We propose an architecture with accompanying protocol for on-board satellite data infrastructure designed for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations offering communication services, such as direct-to-cell connectivity. Our design leverages the unused or under-used computing and communication resources of LEO satellites that are orbiting over uninhabited parts of the earth, like the oceans. We show how blockchain-backed distributed transactions can be run efficiently on this architecture to offer smart contract services. A key aspect of the proposed architecture that sets it apart from other blockchain systems is that migration of the ledger is not done solely to recover from failures. Rather, migration is also performed periodically and continuously as the satellites circle around in their orbits and enter and leave the blockchain service area. We show in simulations how message and blockchain processing overhead can be contained using different sizes of dynamic geo-aware service areas.

<div> 关键词：Federated Learning、非独立同分布、Federated Entropy Pooling、Kullback-Leibler（KL）散度、全局数据分布

总结:
本文聚焦于解决联邦学习(Federated Learning, FL)中非独立同分布(non-IID)问题，特别是针对去中心化联邦学习(Decentralized FL, DFL)场景。研究发现，数据分布的不均匀性导致了模型收敛速度减慢和性能下降。为了应对这一挑战，文章提出了一种创新的去中心化联邦学习聚合算法——Federated Entropy Pooling (FedEP)。

FedEP通过引入局部数据分布的统计特性来缓解客户端漂移问题，而不是直接使用实际数据。每个客户端在训练前使用高斯混合模型(Gaussian Mixture Model, GMM)对本地分布进行拟合，并与邻居共享这些统计特性。之后，每个节点试图拟合全球数据分布。在聚合阶段，每个节点计算其本地数据分布与拟合后的全球数据分布之间的Kullback-Leibler（KL）散度，以此作为权重生成聚合模型。

实验结果表明，FedEP能够实现更快的收敛速度并展现出优于现有方法的测试性能。这一研究为解决非IID问题提供了新的思路，尤其是对于去中心化联邦学习环境而言，具有重要的实践价值和理论意义。 <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) performance is highly influenced by data distribution across clients, and non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) leads to a slower convergence of the global model and a decrease in model effectiveness. The existing algorithms for solving the non-IID problem are focused on the traditional centralized FL (CFL), where a central server is used for model aggregation. However, in decentralized FL (DFL), nodes lack the overall vision of the federation. To address the non-IID problem in DFL, this paper proposes a novel DFL aggregation algorithm, Federated Entropy Pooling (FedEP). FedEP mitigates the client drift problem by incorporating the statistical characteristics of local distributions instead of any actual data. Prior to training, each client conducts a local distribution fitting using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and shares the resulting statistical characteristics with its neighbors. After receiving the statistical characteristics shared by its neighbors, each node tries to fit the global data distribution. In the aggregation phase, each node calculates the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences of the local data distribution over the fitted global data distribution, giving the weights to generate the aggregated model. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that FedEP can achieve faster convergence and show higher test performance than state-of-the-art approaches.

文章主要探讨了区块链Oracle在去中心化金融（DeFi）中的重要性以及当前广泛使用的基于时间加权平均价格（TWAP）的Oracle面临的价格操纵攻击风险。针对这一问题，作者提出了一种新型的链上高效定价算法（Ormer），旨在通过利用分段抛物线公式和融合不同观察窗口大小的估计来准确估算实时资产价格流的中值，从而减少价格误差和延迟。相较于TWAP，Ormer在实证分析中显著降低了平均绝对价格误差（减少了15.3%）和时间延迟（减少了49.3%）。此外，为了优化智能合约设计并确保存储需求的稳定性，不随价格观测数量变化，作者还提出了针对Ormer的优化策略。

Abstract: Blockchain oracle is a critical third-party web service for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. Oracles retrieve external information such as token prices from exchanges and feed them as trusted data sources into smart contracts, enabling core DeFi applications such as loaning protocols. Currently, arithmetic mean based time-weighted average price (TWAP) oracles are widely used in DeFi by averaging external price data with fixed time frame, which is considered reliable and gas-efficient for protocol execution. However, recent research shows that TWAP price feeds are vulnerable to price manipulation attack even with long time frame setting, which would further introduce long time delays and price errors hindering the service quality of DeFi applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel on-chain gas-efficient pricing algorithm (Ormer) that heuristically estimates the median of the current streaming asset price feed based on a piecewise-parabolic formula, while the time delay is suppressed by fusing estimations with different observation window size. Our evaluation based on Ethereum WETH/USDT swapping pair price feed shows that Ormer reduces the mean absolute price error by 15.3% and the time delay by 49.3% compared to TWAP. For gas efficiency, an optimized smart contract design and constant storage requirement regardless of the number of price observations is developed for Ormer.

Abstract: Bilevel programming has recently received attention in the literature due to its wide range of applications, including reinforcement learning and hyper-parameter optimization. However, it is widely assumed that the underlying bilevel optimization problem is solved either by a single machine or, in the case of multiple machines connected in a star-shaped network, i.e., in a federated learning setting. The latter approach suffers from a high communication cost on the central node (e.g., parameter server). Hence, there is an interest in developing methods that solve bilevel optimization problems in a communication-efficient, decentralized manner. To that end, this paper introduces a penalty function-based decentralized algorithm with theoretical guarantees for this class of optimization problems. Specifically, a distributed alternating gradient-type algorithm for solving consensus bilevel programming over a decentralized network is developed. A key feature of the proposed algorithm is the estimation of the hyper-gradient of the penalty function through decentralized computation of matrix-vector products and a few vector communications. The estimation is integrated into an alternating algorithm for solving the penalized reformulation of the bilevel optimization problem. Under appropriate step sizes and penalty parameters, our theoretical framework ensures non-asymptotic convergence to the optimal solution of the original problem under various convexity conditions. Our theoretical result highlights improvements in the iteration complexity of decentralized bilevel optimization, all while making efficient use of vector communication. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in real-world settings.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning in federated learning paradigm has been gaining a lot of interest both in industry and research due to the collaborative learning capability on unlabeled yet isolated data. However, self-supervised based federated learning strategies suffer from performance degradation due to label scarcity and diverse data distributions, i.e., data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose the SelfFed framework for Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Our proposed SelfFed framework works in two phases. The first phase is the pre-training paradigm that performs augmentive modeling using Swin Transformer based encoder in a decentralized manner. The first phase of SelfFed framework helps to overcome the data heterogeneity issue. The second phase is the fine-tuning paradigm that introduces contrastive network and a novel aggregation strategy that is trained on limited labeled data for a target task in a decentralized manner. This fine-tuning stage overcomes the label scarcity problem. We perform our experimental analysis on publicly available medical imaging datasets and show that our proposed SelfFed framework performs better when compared to existing baselines concerning non-independent and identically distributed (IID) data and label scarcity. Our method achieves a maximum improvement of 8.8% and 4.1% on Retina and COVID-FL datasets on non-IID dataset. Further, our proposed method outperforms existing baselines even when trained on a few (10%) labeled instances.

Abstract: Numerous blockchain simulators have been proposed to allow researchers to simulate mainstream blockchains. However, we have not yet found a testbed that enables researchers to develop and evaluate their new consensus algorithms or new protocols for blockchain sharding systems. To fill this gap, we developed BlockEmulator, which is designed as an experimental platform, particularly for emulating blockchain sharding mechanisms. BlockEmulator adopts a lightweight blockchain architecture so developers can only focus on implementing their new protocols or mechanisms. Using layered modules and useful programming interfaces offered by BlockEmulator, researchers can implement a new protocol with minimum effort. Through experiments, we test various functionalities of BlockEmulator in two steps. Firstly, we prove the correctness of the emulation results yielded by BlockEmulator by comparing the theoretical analysis with the observed experiment results. Secondly, other experimental results demonstrate that BlockEmulator can facilitate measuring a series of metrics, including throughput, transaction confirmation latency, cross-shard transaction ratio, the queuing status of transaction pools, workload distribution across blockchain shards, etc. We have made BlockEmulator open-source in Github.

Abstract: Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) drives the prosperity of the blockchain ecosystem. By strategically including, excluding, or reordering transactions within blocks, block producers can extract additional value, which in turn incentivizes them to keep the decentralization of the whole blockchain platform. Before September 2022, around $675M was extracted in terms of MEV in Ethereum. Despite its importance, current work on identifying MEV activities suffers from two limitations. On the one hand, current methods heavily rely on clumsy heuristic rule-based patterns, leading to numerous false negatives or positives. On the other hand, the observations and conclusions are drawn from the early stage of Ethereum, which cannot be used as effective guiding principles after The Merge. To address these challenges, in this work, we innovatively proposed a profitability identification algorithm. Based on this, we designed two robust algorithms to identify MEV activities on our collected largest-ever dataset. Based on the identified results, we have characterized the overall landscape of the Ethereum MEV ecosystem, the impact the private transaction architectures bring in, and the adoption of back-running mechanisms. Our research sheds light on future MEV-related work.

Abstract: Advanced AI applications have become increasingly available to a broad audience, e.g., as centrally managed large language models (LLMs). Such centralization is both a risk and a performance bottleneck - Edge AI promises to be a solution to these problems. However, its decentralized approach raises additional challenges regarding security and safety. In this paper, we argue that both of these aspects are critical for Edge AI, and even more so, their integration. Concretely, we survey security and safety threats, summarize existing countermeasures, and collect open challenges as a call for more research in this area.

总结:
本文详细分析了bittide机制在分布式系统中实现逻辑同步计算的方式。它利用有线网络如以太网固有的连续帧传输特性，通过分散式控制系统调整各节点的本地时钟频率，确保所有节点以一致的时间概念运行。每个节点上的弹性缓冲区吸收频率变化，避免了对全局时钟的依赖。研究通过流模型分析了这些弹性缓冲区的稳态占用率，这是影响系统延迟的关键因素。文中证明了缓冲区占用率的收敛性，并推导出了稳态值的明确公式，该公式基于系统参数包括网络拓扑、物理延迟和控制器增益。这一分析为优化bittide基础分布式系统的缓冲区大小和最小化延迟提供了宝贵的见解。 <div>

Abstract: The bittide mechanism enables logically synchronous computation across distributed systems by leveraging the continuous frame transmission inherent to wired networks such as Ethernet. Instead of relying on a global clock, bittide uses a decentralized control system to adjust local clock frequencies, ensuring all nodes operate with a consistent notion of time by utilizing elastic buffers at each node to absorb frequency variations. This paper presents an analysis of the steady-state occupancy of these elastic buffers, a critical factor influencing system latency. Using a fluid model of the bittide system, we prove that buffer occupancy converges and derive an explicit formula for the steady-state value in terms of system parameters, including network topology, physical latencies, and controller gains. This analysis provides valuable insights for optimizing buffer sizes and minimizing latency in bittide-based distributed systems.

<div> 关键词：编码理论、数据恢复、激励导向环境、节点数量、游戏编码框架

总结:

本文聚焦于编码理论在确保数据完整性和可靠性方面的关键作用，特别是在通信、计算和存储系统中。然而，编码理论依赖于信任假设进行数据恢复，这在新兴的去中心化系统中提出了重大挑战，因为这些系统中的信任稀缺。为解决这一问题，文章引入了“游戏编码”框架，旨在揭示激励导向环境中数据恢复策略的洞察。

文章特别关注了由一个诚实节点和多个敌对节点构成的场景。研究发现，尽管敌对节点数量增加为它们提供了更多的灵活性，但增加的权力实际上并不利于敌对节点，也不损害数据收集者，因此该方案具有抗Sybil攻击性。

此外，文章还阐述了数据收集者在接纳或拒绝输入方面的最优策略，并对敌对节点的最优噪声分布进行了特征分析。这一研究为理解在不同节点配置下编码理论的应用提供了新的视角，并为设计更安全、高效的去中心化系统提供了理论基础。 <div>

Abstract: Coding theory plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and reliability across various domains, from communication to computation and storage systems. However, its reliance on trust assumptions for data recovery poses significant challenges, particularly in emerging decentralized systems where trust is scarce. To address this, the game of coding framework was introduced, offering insights into strategies for data recovery within incentive-oriented environments. The focus of the earliest version of the game of coding was limited to scenarios involving only two nodes. This paper investigates the implications of increasing the number of nodes in the game of coding framework, particularly focusing on scenarios with one honest node and multiple adversarial nodes. We demonstrate that despite the increased flexibility for the adversary with an increasing number of adversarial nodes, having more power is not beneficial for the adversary and is not detrimental to the data collector, making this scheme sybil-resistant. Furthermore, we outline optimal strategies for the data collector in terms of accepting or rejecting the inputs, and characterize the optimal noise distribution for the adversary.

Abstract: We present an innovative framework that integrates consumer-grade drones into bushfire management, addressing both service improvement and data privacy concerns under Australia's Privacy Act 1988. This system establishes a marketplace where bushfire management authorities, as data consumers, access critical information from drone operators, who serve as data providers. The framework employs local differential privacy to safeguard the privacy of data providers from all system entities, ensuring compliance with privacy standards. Additionally, a blockchain-based solution facilitates fair data and fee exchanges while maintaining immutable records for enhanced accountability. Validated through a proof-of-concept implementation, the framework's scalability and adaptability make it well-suited for large-scale, real-world applications in bushfire management.

<div> 关键词：区块链、数据存储、Kademlia协议、Merkle证明、Verkle证明

总结:

本文提出了一种新的区块链网络参与协议，旨在让验证节点无需在每个节点上存储整个网络状态，以降低存储成本。该协议的核心理念是将区块链网络作为复制状态机和分布式存储系统使用，通过分布式状态和基于Kademlia启发式路由协议的高效数据检索机制来减少验证节点的存储需求。使用加密证明（如Merkle证明）允许节点验证其他节点存储的数据，而无需直接信任这些节点。

为了验证该状态共享协议的有效性，文章进行了对以太坊数据存储和访问模式的广泛定量分析。结果表明，虽然该协议显著降低了存储需求，但带来了从1.5MB到5MB不等的每区块额外带宽使用量，相当于每月额外319GB到1065GB的带宽消耗。尽管如此，这个增量仍然足够小，可以在以太坊的12秒块验证窗口内传递给所有节点并进行验证。进一步的分析显示，Merkle证明是增加带宽的主要因素。为了解决这一问题，文章还分析了转向更空间高效的Verkle证明的影响。 <div>

Abstract: The perpetual growth of data stored on popular blockchains such as Ethereum leads to significant scalability challenges and substantial storage costs for operators of full nodes. Increasing costs may lead to fewer independently operated nodes in the network, which poses risks to decentralization (and hence network security), but also pushes decentralized app developers towards centrally hosted API services.
  This paper introduces a new protocol that allows validator nodes to participate in a blockchain network without the need to store the full state of the network on each node. The key idea is to use the blockchain network as both a replicated state machine and as a distributed storage system. By distributing states across nodes and enabling efficient data retrieval through a Kademlia-inspired routing protocol, we reduce storage costs for validators. Cryptographic proofs (such as Merkle proofs) are used to allow nodes to verify data stored by other nodes without having to trust those nodes directly. While the protocol trades off data storage for increased network bandwidth, we show how gossiping and caching can minimize the increased bandwidth needs.
  To validate our state sharing protocol, we conduct an extensive quantitative analysis of Ethereum's data storage and data access patterns. Our findings indicate that while our protocol significantly lowers storage needs, it comes with an increased bandwidth usage ranging from 1.5 MB to 5 MB per block, translating to an additional monthly bandwidth of 319 GB to 1,065 GB. Despite this, the size remains small enough such that it can be passed to all nodes and validated within Ethereum's 12-second block validation window. Further analysis shows that Merkle proofs are the most significant contributor to the additional bandwidth. To address this concern, we also analyze the impact of switching to the more space-efficient Verkle Proofs.

Abstract: Conventional tomographic reconstruction typically depends on centralized servers for both data storage and computation, leading to concerns about memory limitations and data privacy. Distributed reconstruction algorithms mitigate these issues by partitioning data across multiple nodes, reducing server load and enhancing privacy. However, these algorithms often encounter challenges related to memory constraints and communication overhead between nodes. In this paper, we introduce a decentralized Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM) with configurable quantization. By distributing local objectives across nodes, our approach is highly scalable and can efficiently reconstruct images while adapting to available resources. To overcome communication bottlenecks, we propose two quantization techniques based on K-means clustering and JPEG compression. Numerical experiments with benchmark images illustrate the tradeoffs between communication efficiency, memory use, and reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), introduced in 2016, was designed to enhance data privacy in collaborative model training environments. Among the FL paradigm, horizontal FL, where clients share the same set of features but different data samples, has been extensively studied in both centralized and decentralized settings. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), which is crucial in real-world decentralized scenarios where clients possess different, yet sensitive, data about the same entity, remains underexplored. Thus, this work introduces De-VertiFL, a novel solution for training models in a decentralized VFL setting. De-VertiFL contributes by introducing a new network architecture distribution, an innovative knowledge exchange scheme, and a distributed federated training process. Specifically, De-VertiFL enables the sharing of hidden layer outputs among federation clients, allowing participants to benefit from intermediate computations, thereby improving learning efficiency. De-VertiFL has been evaluated using a variety of well-known datasets, including both image and tabular data, across binary and multiclass classification tasks. The results demonstrate that De-VertiFL generally surpasses state-of-the-art methods in F1-score performance, while maintaining a decentralized and privacy-preserving framework.

Abstract: There is a huge demand to ensure the compliance of smart contracts listed on blockchain platforms to safety and economic standards. Today, manual efforts in the form of auditing are commonly used to achieve this goal. ML-based automated techniques have the promise to alleviate human efforts and the resulting monetary costs. However, unlike other domains where ML techniques have had huge successes, no systematic ML techniques have been proposed or applied to smart contract auditing. We present SC-Bench, the first dataset for automated smart-contract auditing research. SC-Bench consists of 5,377 real-world smart contracts running on Ethereum, a widely used blockchain platform, and 15,975 violations of standards on Ehereum called ERCs. Out of these violations, 139 are real violations programmers made. The remaining are errors we systematically injected to reflect the violations of different ERC rules. We evaluate SC-Bench using GPT-4 by prompting it with both the contracts and ERC rules. In addition, we manually identify each violated rule and the corresponding code site (i.e., oracle) and prompt GPT-4 with the information asking for a True-or-False question. Our results show that without the oracle, GPT-4 can only detect 0.9% violations, and with the oracle, it detects 22.9% violations. These results show the potential room for improvement in ML-based techniques for smart-contract auditing.

Abstract: Mobile devices offload latency-sensitive application tasks to edge servers to satisfy applications' Quality of Service (QoS) deadlines. Consequently, ensuring reliable offloading without QoS violations is challenging in distributed and unreliable edge environments. However, current edge offloading solutions are either centralized or do not adequately address challenges in distributed environments. We propose FRESCO, a fast and reliable edge offloading framework that utilizes a blockchain-based reputation system, which enhances the reliability of offloading in the distributed edge. The distributed reputation system tracks the historical performance of edge servers, while blockchain through a consensus mechanism ensures that sensitive reputation information is secured against tampering. However, blockchain consensus typically has high latency, and therefore we employ a Hybrid Smart Contract (HSC) that automatically computes and stores reputation securely on-chain (i.e., on the blockchain) while allowing fast offloading decisions off-chain (i.e., outside of blockchain). The offloading decision engine uses a reputation score to derive fast offloading decisions, which are based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT). The SMT models edge resource constraints, and QoS deadlines, and can formally guarantee a feasible solution that is valuable for latency-sensitive applications that require high reliability. With a combination of on-chain HSC reputation state management and an off-chain SMT decision engine, FRESCO offloads tasks to reliable servers without being hindered by blockchain consensus. We evaluate FRESCO against real availability traces and simulated applications. FRESCO reduces response time by up to 7.86 times and saves energy by up to 5.4% compared to all baselines while minimizing QoS violations to 0.4% and achieving an average decision time of 5.05 milliseconds.

Abstract: European energy markets are decentralized and entail balance responsibility of each market player. This stresses the importance of imbalance management of renewable energy sources (RES), as the imbalance payments can strongly reduce their profitability. According to the EU Electricity Balancing Guideline, each European transmission system operator should use the single imbalance pricing method which treats both deviation directions the same, no matter if a deviation helps the system or pushes it away from the balance. This paper aims to investigate the behavior of a hybrid facility consisting of an uncontrollable RES, a battery and an electrolyzer under such market setting. The formulated mathematical model of the hybrid facility seeks to maximize profit in the day-ahead energy market, while minimizing the imbalance costs. Uncertainty of the RES output is captured using stochastic scenarios, while the direction of the power system deviation, relevant for the imbalance pricing, is modeled using a newly proposed robust approach. Results of the case study indicate that the single imbalance pricing scheme might bring flexible assets to temptation of intentional deviations should they anticipate favorable imbalance prices.

Our results demonstrate that the GAT-ResNet model has a potential to outperform the existing graph network models in terms of accuracy, reliability and scalability.

Abstract: This article proposes a novel framework that utilizes an over-the-air Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to learn Metaverse users' expectations. By interpreting users' brain activities, our framework can optimize physical resources and enhance Quality-of-Experience (QoE) for users. To achieve this, we leverage a Wireless Edge Server (WES) to process electroencephalography (EEG) signals via uplink wireless channels, thus eliminating the computational burden for Metaverse users' devices. As a result, the WES can learn human behaviors, adapt system configurations, and allocate radio resources to tailor personalized user settings. Despite the potential of BCI, the inherent noisy wireless channels and uncertainty of the EEG signals make the related resource allocation and learning problems especially challenging. We formulate the joint learning and resource allocation problem as a mixed integer programming problem. Our solution involves two algorithms: a hybrid learning algorithm and a meta-learning algorithm. The hybrid learning algorithm can effectively find the solution for the formulated problem. Specifically, the meta-learning algorithm can further exploit the neurodiversity of the EEG signals across multiple users, leading to higher classification accuracy. Extensive simulation results with real-world BCI datasets show the effectiveness of our framework with low latency and high EEG signal classification accuracy.

Abstract: Group fairness in machine learning is a critical area of research focused on achieving equitable outcomes across different groups defined by sensitive attributes such as race or gender. Federated learning, a decentralized approach to training machine learning models across multiple devices or organizations without sharing raw data, amplifies the need for fairness due to the heterogeneous data distributions across clients, which can exacerbate biases. The intersection of federated learning and group fairness has attracted significant interest, with 47 research works specifically dedicated to addressing this issue. However, no dedicated survey has focused comprehensively on group fairness in federated learning. In this work, we present an in-depth survey on this topic, addressing the critical challenges and reviewing related works in the field. We create a novel taxonomy of these approaches based on key criteria such as data partitioning, location, and applied strategies. Additionally, we explore broader concerns related to this problem and investigate how different approaches handle the complexities of various sensitive groups and their intersections. Finally, we review the datasets and applications commonly used in current research. We conclude by highlighting key areas for future research, emphasizing the need for more methods to address the complexities of achieving group fairness in federated systems.

<div> 关键词：多智能体强化学习、深度学习、大型语言模型、策略生成、决策协作

总结:

本文提出了一种名为“你只需要一次大型语言模型”（YOLO-MARL）的新框架，旨在利用大型语言模型（LLM）的高级任务规划能力来增强多智能体在合作游戏中的决策过程。YOLO-MARL的主要创新点在于，对于每个特定的游戏环境，它仅需要一次与LLM的交互，分别完成策略生成、状态解释和规划函数生成模块的任务，从而在多智能体策略训练阶段避免了频繁调用LLM API的成本和计算时间。

具体而言，该框架通过将LLM的决策过程前置，使得训练后的分布式小型神经网络基线策略能够独立运行，无需依赖于持续的LLM支持。这种方法在三个不同环境中进行了评估，并展示了与传统多智能体强化学习算法相比的显著性能提升。

综上所述，YOLO-MARL通过优化策略生成流程并减少对大型语言模型的依赖，为多智能体系统在复杂合作场景下的高效决策提供了新的解决方案。 <div>

Abstract: Advancements in deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have positioned it as a promising approach for decision-making in cooperative games. However, it still remains challenging for MARL agents to learn cooperative strategies for some game environments. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent reasoning capabilities, making them promising candidates for enhancing coordination among the agents. However, due to the model size of LLMs, it can be expensive to frequently infer LLMs for actions that agents can take. In this work, we propose You Only LLM Once for MARL (YOLO-MARL), a novel framework that leverages the high-level task planning capabilities of LLMs to improve the policy learning process of multi-agents in cooperative games. Notably, for each game environment, YOLO-MARL only requires one time interaction with LLMs in the proposed strategy generation, state interpretation and planning function generation modules, before the MARL policy training process. This avoids the ongoing costs and computational time associated with frequent LLMs API calls during training. Moreover, the trained decentralized normal-sized neural network-based policies operate independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method across three different environments and demonstrate that YOLO-MARL outperforms traditional MARL algorithms.

总结:
本文探讨了设计大型分布式系统控制策略的挑战，特别是在满足关键的时间逻辑基于规格（如安全性）方面，这些规格必须以高概率实现。为了解决这个问题，文章提出了一种基于Constrained Markov Decision Processes（CMDPs）的框架，提供了一种假设-保证的分解方法，用于合成多代理环境下的去中心化控制策略，同时满足逻辑约束。该方法确保策略以高概率满足约束，并提供达到目标奖励的下限。通过实验证明，这种方法返回的策略不仅实现了接近最优的奖励，还显著减少了问题规模和执行时间，达到了约一个数量级的减少。这一成果对于提高大型分布式系统的效率和可靠性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Designing control policies for large, distributed systems is challenging, especially in the context of critical, temporal logic based specifications (e.g., safety) that must be met with high probability. Compositional methods for such problems are needed for scalability, yet relying on worst-case assumptions for decomposition tends to be overly conservative. In this work, we use the framework of Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) to provide an assume-guarantee based decomposition for synthesizing decentralized control policies, subject to logical constraints in a multi-agent setting. The returned policies are guaranteed to satisfy the constraints with high probability and provide a lower bound on the achieved objective reward. We empirically find the returned policies to achieve near-optimal rewards while enjoying an order of magnitude reduction in problem size and execution time.

<div> 关键词：BlockFound、基础模型、异常检测、区块链交易、定制设计

总结:
文章介绍了名为BlockFound的基础模型，这是一个专门用于检测区块链交易异常的新方法。与依赖于规则系统或直接应用现成大型语言模型的传统方法不同，BlockFound引入了一系列定制化的设计来适应区块链交易的独特数据结构。首先，它设计了一个模块化的分词器来处理多模态输入，平衡了不同模态的信息。其次，设计了一种定制的掩码语言学习机制进行预训练，使用RoPE嵌入和FlashAttention来处理更长的序列。

在对以太坊和索拉纳交易的广泛评估中，BlockFound展示了其在异常检测方面的卓越能力，同时保持了较低的误报率。值得注意的是，BlockFound是唯一能够以高精度在索拉纳上成功检测到异常交易的方法，而其他所有方法的检测召回分数都非常低甚至为零。这项工作不仅提供了新的区块链基础模型，还为将大型语言模型应用于区块链数据设定了新基准。 <div>

Abstract: We propose BlockFound, a customized foundation model for anomaly blockchain transaction detection. Unlike existing methods that rely on rule-based systems or directly apply off-the-shelf large language models, BlockFound introduces a series of customized designs to model the unique data structure of blockchain transactions. First, a blockchain transaction is multi-modal, containing blockchain-specific tokens, texts, and numbers. We design a modularized tokenizer to handle these multi-modal inputs, balancing the information across different modalities. Second, we design a customized mask language learning mechanism for pretraining with RoPE embedding and FlashAttention for handling longer sequences. After training the foundation model, we further design a novel detection method for anomaly detection. Extensive evaluations on Ethereum and Solana transactions demonstrate BlockFound's exceptional capability in anomaly detection while maintaining a low false positive rate. Remarkably, BlockFound is the only method that successfully detects anomalous transactions on Solana with high accuracy, whereas all other approaches achieved very low or zero detection recall scores. This work not only provides new foundation models for blockchain but also sets a new benchmark for applying LLMs in blockchain data.

<title>180 Days After EIP-4844: Will Blob Sharing Solve Dilemma for Small Rollups?</title>

<div> 关键词：EIP-4844、数据可用性（DA）、Blob共享、成本降低、服务质量提升

<br /><br />
总结: 文章主要探讨了在以太坊网络中引入EIP-4844之后，通过使用Blob共享技术来优化数据可用性（DA）成本的问题。在实施EIP-4844后，Blob的固定大小为128KB，导致数据吞吐量低的Rollup面临两难选择：要么不充分利用Blob资源，要么减少DA提交频率。文章提出并验证了Blob共享策略，即多个Rollup共享一个Blob，能够显著改善小规模Rollup的成本和DA服务质量，有效解决了上述问题。实证分析表明，当Rollup合作进行Blob共享时，成本降低幅度超过90%，这主要归因于通过Blob共享实现的Blob基础费用平滑效果。 <div>

Abstract: The introduction of blobs through EIP-4844 has significantly reduced the Data Availability (DA) costs for rollups on Ethereum. However, due to the fixed size of blobs at 128 KB, rollups with low data throughput face a dilemma: they either use blobs inefficiently or decrease the frequency of DA submissions. Blob sharing, where multiple rollups share a single blob, has been proposed as a solution to this problem. This paper examines the effectiveness of blob sharing based on real-world data collected approximately six months after the implementation of EIP-4844. By simulating cost changes using a simple blob sharing format, we demonstrate that blob sharing can substantially improve the costs and DA service quality for small rollups, effectively resolving their dilemma. Notably, we observed cost reductions in USD exceeding 90% for most of the rollups when they cooperate, attributable to the smoothing effect of the blob base fee achieved through blob sharing.

<div> 关键词：联邦学习、联邦卸载、隐私保护、效率、非IID数据

总结:

本文提出了贡献衰减(ConDa)框架，旨在解决联邦学习中卸载特定参与者及其相关数据的问题。在联邦卸载中，移除参与者的数据对模型性能的影响是一个挑战。ConDa通过追踪每个客户端影响全局模型的参数，并对具有隐私侵犯贡献的全局模型参数进行突触衰减，实现了高效卸载。该方法无需使用客户端数据或重新训练模型，也不对客户端或服务器端造成任何计算负担。

ConDa的实验结果在MNIST、CIFAR10和CIFAR100等数据集上得到了验证，证明了其在卸载客户端数据方面的有效性和速度优势，相比现有最先进的方法至少快100倍。特别地，本文强调了在非独立同分布（non-IID）联邦学习环境下卸载的挑战性，并展示了ConDa在此环境下的鲁棒性。此外，通过对抗后门攻击和成员推断攻击，验证了ConDa的防御能力。这项工作对于满足法律和伦理要求的联邦学习至关重要。 <div>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has enabled collaborative model training across decentralized data sources or clients. While adding new participants to a shared model does not pose great technical hurdles, the removal of a participant and their related information contained in the shared model remains a challenge. To address this problem, federated unlearning has emerged as a critical research direction, seeking to remove information from globally trained models without harming the model performance on the remaining data. Most modern federated unlearning methods use costly approaches such as the use of remaining clients data to retrain the global model or methods that would require heavy computation on client or server side. We introduce Contribution Dampening (ConDa), a framework that performs efficient unlearning by tracking down the parameters which affect the global model for each client and performs synaptic dampening on the parameters of the global model that have privacy infringing contributions from the forgetting client. Our technique does not require clients data or any kind of retraining and it does not put any computational overhead on either the client or server side. We perform experiments on multiple datasets and demonstrate that ConDa is effective to forget a client's data. In experiments conducted on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets, ConDa proves to be the fastest federated unlearning method, outperforming the nearest state of the art approach by at least 100x. Our emphasis is on the non-IID Federated Learning setting, which presents the greatest challenge for unlearning. Additionally, we validate ConDa's robustness through backdoor and membership inference attacks. We envision this work as a crucial component for FL in adhering to legal and ethical requirements.

<div> 关键词：能源社区、公平性、福利最大化、分散式实施、定价策略

总结:

本文探讨了在多元社会经济背景下的能源社区中实现公平能源接入的问题。文章关注点在于如何在确保整体福利最大化的前提下，同时考虑成员间公平性问题，这与目前优化能源消耗调度研究中较少涉及的公平性集成形成了鲜明对比。

首先，文章引入了“公平相关福利最大化”(EqWM)模型，这是一个旨在优化能源调度以最大化总体福利的框架，同时考虑到公平性约束条件。这一模型旨在平衡社区内不同成员的利益，确保每个人都能从能源使用中获益，而不仅仅是整体效益的最大化。

其次，为了实现EqWM模型的分散式实施，文章提出了“分散式公平最大化”(D-EqWM)概念。这是一种两层优化策略，其中非营利运营者设计了一种社区定价政策，以最大化整体福利，同时遵守确保公平接入的限制。社区成员根据这些价格优化他们的个人能源消费。

接着，文章详细阐述了最优定价政策及其关键特性。这包括了如何制定能够促进公平性、同时最大化整体福利的定价机制，以及这种机制如何在实际操作中运行。

最后，通过分析和讨论，文章为解决能源社区中的公平性挑战提供了一个理论框架和实践路径，即通过结合福利最大化和公平性原则来优化能源调度和定价策略，从而实现资源的更高效、更公平利用。 <div>

Abstract: We address the issue of equitable energy access within an energy community consisting of members with diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, including varying income levels and differing capacities to access distributed energy resources such as solar power and storage systems. While optimal energy consumption scheduling is well-studied, integrating equity into decentralized real-time energy access remains under-explored. This paper formulates Equity-regarding Welfare Maximization (EqWM)--a welfare optimization energy scheduling subject to equity constraints. We further develop a decentralized implementation (D-EqWM) as a bi-level optimization, where a non-profit operator designs a community pricing policy aimed at maximizing overall welfare, subject to constraints that ensure equitable access. Community members, in turn, optimize their individual consumption based on these prices. We present the optimal pricing policy along with its key properties.

Abstract: In the contemporary business landscape, collaboration across multiple organizations offers a multitude of opportunities, including reduced operational costs, enhanced performance, and accelerated technological advancement. The application of process mining techniques in an inter-organizational setting, exploiting the recorded process event data, enables the coordination of joint effort and allows for a deeper understanding of the business. Nevertheless, considerable concerns pertaining to data confidentiality emerge, as organizations frequently demonstrate a reluctance to expose sensitive data demanded for process mining, due to concerns related to privacy and security risks. The presence of conflicting interests among the parties involved can impede the practice of open data sharing. To address these challenges, we propose our approach and toolset named CONFINE, which we developed with the intent of enabling process mining on process event data from multiple providers while preserving the confidentiality and integrity of the original records. To ensure that the presented interaction protocol steps are secure and that the processed information is hidden from both involved and external actors, our approach is based on a decentralized architecture and consists of trusted applications running in Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). In this demo paper, we provide an overview of the core components and functionalities as well as the specific details of its application.

Abstract: One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL), a special decentralized machine learning paradigm, has recently gained significant attention. OSFL requires only a single round of client data or model upload, which reduces communication costs and mitigates privacy threats compared to traditional FL. Despite these promising prospects, existing methods face challenges due to client data heterogeneity and limited data quantity when applied to real-world OSFL systems. Recently, Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) have shown remarkable advancements in synthesizing high-quality images through pretraining on large-scale datasets, thereby presenting a potential solution to overcome these issues. However, directly applying pretrained LDM to heterogeneous OSFL results in significant distribution shifts in synthetic data, leading to performance degradation in classification models trained on such data. This issue is particularly pronounced in rare domains, such as medical imaging, which are underrepresented in LDM's pretraining data. To address this challenge, we propose Federated Bi-Level Personalization (FedBiP), which personalizes the pretrained LDM at both instance-level and concept-level. Hereby, FedBiP synthesizes images following the client's local data distribution without compromising the privacy regulations. FedBiP is also the first approach to simultaneously address feature space heterogeneity and client data scarcity in OSFL. Our method is validated through extensive experiments on three OSFL benchmarks with feature space heterogeneity, as well as on challenging medical and satellite image datasets with label heterogeneity. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedBiP, which substantially outperforms other OSFL methods.

Abstract: Conventional federated learning frameworks suffer from several challenges including performance bottlenecks at the central aggregation server, data bias, poor model convergence, and exposure to model poisoning attacks, and limited trust in the centralized infrastructure. In the current paper, a novel game theory-based approach called pFedGame is proposed for decentralized federated learning, best suitable for temporally dynamic networks. The proposed algorithm works without any centralized server for aggregation and incorporates the problem of vanishing gradients and poor convergence over temporally dynamic topology among federated learning participants. The solution comprises two sequential steps in every federated learning round, for every participant. First, it selects suitable peers for collaboration in federated learning. Secondly, it executes a two-player constant sum cooperative game to reach convergence by applying an optimal federated learning aggregation strategy. Experiments performed to assess the performance of pFedGame in comparison to existing methods in decentralized federated learning have shown promising results with accuracy higher than 70% for heterogeneous data.

Abstract: The classical distributed key generation protocols (DKG) are resurging due to their widespread applications in blockchain. While efforts have been made to improve DKG communication, practical large-scale deployments are still yet to come due to various challenges, including the heavy computation and communication (particularly broadcast) overhead in their adversarial cases. In this paper, we propose a practical DKG for DLog-based cryptosystems, which achieves (quasi-)linear computation and communication per-node cost with the help of a common coin, even in the face of the maximal amount of Byzantine nodes. Moreover, our protocol is secure against adaptive adversaries, which can corrupt less than half of all nodes. The key to our improvements lies in delegating the most costly operations to an Any-Trust group together with a set of techniques for adaptive security. This group is randomly sampled and consists of a small number of individuals. The population only trusts that at least one member in the group is honest, without knowing which one. Moreover, we present a generic transformer that enables us to efficiently deploy a conventional distributed protocol like our DKG, even when the participants have different weights. Additionally, we introduce an extended broadcast channel based on a blockchain and data dispersal network (such as IPFS), enabling reliable broadcasting of arbitrary-size messages at the cost of constant-size blockchain storage.

总结:
本文研究了在M个客户端上的在线模型选择问题，重点探讨了客户端间合作的必要性。通过引入计算约束这一新颖视角，文章提出了以下关键发现：

1. **无计算约束情况下的合作可有可无**：当客户端没有计算限制时，合作并不必要。这意味着，如果客户端能够轻松处理大量数据和计算任务，那么他们可以独立进行模型选择，无需与他人协作。

Abstract: We consider online model selection with decentralized data over $M$ clients, and study the necessity of collaboration among clients. Previous work proposed various federated algorithms without demonstrating their necessity,while we answer the question from a novel perspective of computational constraints. We prove lower bounds on the regret, and propose a federated algorithm and analyze the upper bound.Our results show (i) collaboration is unnecessary in the absence of computational constraints on clients; (ii) collaboration is necessary if the computational cost on each client is limited to $o(K)$, where $K$ is the number of candidate hypothesis spaces. We clarify the unnecessary nature of collaboration in previous federated algorithms for distributed online multi-kernel learning,and improve the regret bounds at a smaller computational and communication cost. Our algorithm relies on three new techniques including an improved Bernstein's inequality for martingale, a federated online mirror descent framework, and decoupling model selection and prediction, which might be of independent interest.

<div> 关键词：人工智能、强化学习、代理理论、元算法、多智能体系统

总结:

本文探讨了AI在互联网未来生态中的角色，提出了通过结合强化学习与经济学中的代理理论来协调AI智能体之间互动的框架。强化学习提供了一种允许AI智能体进行自由干预的方法，但存在难以扩展到连续场景的问题；而代理理论则解决了个体利益与社会福利之间的冲突，但在大规模应用中遇到了挑战。通过将两者结合，本文提出了一种元算法框架，该框架允许智能体在马尔可夫决策过程中接受指导，通过一系列合同来规定基于智能体行动结果的支付方式。

元算法通过迭代优化智能体和引导者（即“主”）的策略，并证明其等价于引导者的Q函数上的收敛操作器，最终达到子博弈完美均衡状态。为了解决实际应用中的计算复杂性问题，作者进一步引入深度强化学习技术，并分析了在存在近似误差情况下的算法收敛性。针对多智能体系统，文章以组合硬币游戏为例，展示了如何应用上述方法解决更复杂的、具有社会困境特征的问题。这一研究为构建更加高效、协调的多智能体系统提供了理论基础和技术路径，预示着AI在社会协作领域的重要应用前景。 <div>

Abstract: The increasing deployment of AI is shaping the future landscape of the internet, which is set to become an integrated ecosystem of AI agents. Orchestrating the interaction among AI agents necessitates decentralized, self-sustaining mechanisms that harmonize the tension between individual interests and social welfare. In this paper we tackle this challenge by synergizing reinforcement learning with principal-agent theory from economics. Taken separately, the former allows unrealistic freedom of intervention, while the latter struggles to scale in sequential settings. Combining them achieves the best of both worlds. We propose a framework where a principal guides an agent in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) using a series of contracts, which specify payments by the principal based on observable outcomes of the agent's actions. We present and analyze a meta-algorithm that iteratively optimizes the policies of the principal and agent, showing its equivalence to a contraction operator on the principal's Q-function, and its convergence to subgame-perfect equilibrium. We then scale our algorithm with deep Q-learning and analyze its convergence in the presence of approximation error, both theoretically and through experiments with randomly generated binary game-trees. Extending our framework to multiple agents, we apply our methodology to the combinatorial Coin Game. Addressing this multi-agent sequential social dilemma is a promising first step toward scaling our approach to more complex, real-world instances.

Abstract: In a mixed traffic with connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) coexisting, data-driven predictive control of CAVs promises system-wide traffic performance improvements. Yet, most existing approaches focus on a centralized setup, which is not computationally scalable while failing to protect data privacy. The robustness against unknown disturbances has not been well addressed either, causing safety concerns. In this paper, we propose a decentralized robust DeeP-LCC (Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control) approach for CAVs to smooth mixed traffic flow. In particular, each CAV computes its control input based on locally available data from its involved subsystem. Meanwhile, the interaction between neighboring subsystems is modeled as a bounded disturbance, for which appropriate estimation methods are proposed. Then, we formulate a robust optimization problem and present its tractable computational solutions. Compared with the centralized formulation, our method greatly reduces computation burden with better safety performance, while naturally preserving data privacy. Extensive traffic simulations validate its wave-dampening ability, safety performance, and computational benefits.

<div> 关键词：Federated Learning、FedCert、Robustness Evaluation、Certified Accuracy、Client Grouping Algorithm

<br /><br />
总结:

本文聚焦于Federated Learning（FL）领域的一个关键问题：如何评估模型在面对客户端数据扰动时的鲁棒性。在传统的集中式训练中，通过认证精度可以确保一定比例的预测即使在输入数据被扰动后也能保持正确。然而，这一评估方式难以直接应用于FL，因为FL模型的训练依赖于分散在不同客户端的数据，而这些数据的具体分布未知。

为解决这一挑战，研究团队提出了FedCert方法，这是评估FL系统鲁棒性的第一步。FedCert通过估计全局模型的认证精度，基于每个客户端的认证精度和类分布来实现这一目标。考虑到现实世界中数据非独立同分布（Non-IID）的特性，研究引入了客户端分组算法，以确保聚合步骤中的认证精度可靠性。

理论分析证明了FedCert的有效性，实验结果在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集下的多种场景下显示，FedCert能显著降低与基准方法相比的估计误差。这项工作为评估FL系统的鲁棒性和可靠性提供了解决方案，并为未来增强分散学习的可靠性铺平了道路。 <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training machine learning models in a decentralized manner, preserving data privacy by keeping local data on clients. However, evaluating the robustness of these models against data perturbations on clients remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have assessed the effectiveness of models in centralized training based on certified accuracy, which guarantees that a certain percentage of the model's predictions will remain correct even if the input data is perturbed. However, the challenge of extending these evaluations to FL remains unresolved due to the unknown client's local data. To tackle this challenge, this study proposed a method named FedCert to take the first step toward evaluating the robustness of FL systems. The proposed method is designed to approximate the certified accuracy of a global model based on the certified accuracy and class distribution of each client. Additionally, considering the Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) nature of data in real-world scenarios, we introduce the client grouping algorithm to ensure reliable certified accuracy during the aggregation step of the approximation algorithm. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FedCert in assessing the robustness and reliability of FL systems. Moreover, experimental results on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various scenarios show that FedCert consistently reduces the estimation error compared to baseline methods. This study offers a solution for evaluating the robustness of FL systems and lays the groundwork for future research to enhance the dependability of decentralized learning.

Abstract: A niche corner of the Web3 world is increasingly making use of hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to build decentralized infrastructure. One of the motivations to use TEEs is to go beyond the current performance limitations of cryptography-based alternatives such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), and multi-party computation (MPC). Despite their appealing advantages, current TEEs suffer from serious limitations as they are not secure against physical attacks, and their attestation mechanism is rooted in the chip manufacturer's trust. As a result, Web3 applications have to rely on cloud infrastruture to act as trusted guardians of hardware-based TEEs and have to accept to trust chip manufacturers. This work aims at exploring how we could potentially architect and implement chips that would be secure against physical attacks and would not require putting trust in chip manufacturers. One goal of this work is to motivate the Web3 movement to acknowledge and leverage the substantial amount of relevant hardware research that already exists. In brief, a combination of: (1) physical unclonable functions (PUFs) to secure the root-of-trust; (2) masking and redundancy techniques to secure computations; (3) open source hardware and imaging techniques to verify that a chip matches its expected design; can help move towards attesting that a given TEE can be trusted without the need to trust a cloud provider and a chip manufacturer.

<div> 关键词：Federated Learning（FL）、Batch Normalization（BN）、FedTAN、SCAFFOLD、BN-SCAFFOLD

<br /><br />
总结:
文章主要探讨了在异构联邦学习(Federated Learning, FL)环境中，如何有效地利用批量归一化(Batch Normalization, BN)来训练深度神经网络(Depth Neural Networks, DNN)。文章首先指出，尽管联邦学习作为一种分散式机器学习范式正逐渐受到关注，但传统的批量归一化方法在异构环境中可能会降低模型性能。为此，作者提出了一种名为FedTAN的算法，旨在通过聚合所有客户端的批量归一化统计和梯度来减轻异构性的影响。然而，该算法存在较高的通信成本问题，其复杂度与DNN的深度成线性关系。

接着，文章引入了SCAFFOLD算法，这是一种能够以高效方式减少客户端漂移的偏差减少算法。虽然SCAFFOLD在异构联邦学习中显示出良好的潜力，但其在具有批量归一化的模型上表现不佳。为了解决这个问题，作者提出了BN-SCAFFOLD算法，它将SCAFFOLD的客户端漂移修正策略扩展到批量归一化统计。通过引入统一的理论框架，基于Wang等人2023年的工作，文章证明了BN-SCAFFOLD算法能够有效消除批量归一化引入的偏见，并通过实验验证了理论结果在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的有效性。实验结果表明，BN-SCAFFOLD算法在性能上与FedTAN相当，但无需后者高昂的通信成本，同时优于传统的联邦平均(FedAvg)方法和其他旨在缓解批量归一化异构性的联邦学习算法。 <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is gaining traction as a learning paradigm for training Machine Learning (ML) models in a decentralized way. Batch Normalization (BN) is ubiquitous in Deep Neural Networks (DNN), as it improves convergence and generalization. However, BN has been reported to hinder performance of DNNs in heterogeneous FL. Recently, the FedTAN algorithm has been proposed to mitigate the effect of heterogeneity on BN, by aggregating BN statistics and gradients from all the clients. However, it has a high communication cost, that increases linearly with the depth of the DNN. SCAFFOLD is a variance reduction algorithm, that estimates and corrects the client drift in a communication-efficient manner. Despite its promising results in heterogeneous FL settings, it has been reported to underperform for models with BN. In this work, we seek to revive SCAFFOLD, and more generally variance reduction, as an efficient way of training DNN with BN in heterogeneous FL. We introduce a unified theoretical framework for analyzing the convergence of variance reduction algorithms in the BN-DNN setting, inspired of by the work of Wang et al. 2023, and show that SCAFFOLD is unable to remove the bias introduced by BN. We thus propose the BN-SCAFFOLD algorithm, which extends the client drift correction of SCAFFOLD to BN statistics. We prove convergence using the aforementioned framework and validate the theoretical results with experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10. BN-SCAFFOLD equals the performance of FedTAN, without its high communication cost, outperforming Federated Averaging (FedAvg), SCAFFOLD, and other FL algorithms designed to mitigate BN heterogeneity.

Abstract: Light clients are gaining increasing attention in the literature since they obviate the need for users to set up dedicated blockchain full nodes. While the literature features a number of light client instantiations, most light client protocols optimize for long offline phases and implicitly assume that the block headers to be verified are signed by highly dynamic validators.
  In this paper, we show that (i) most light clients are rarely offline for more than a week, and (ii) validators are unlikely to drastically change in most permissioned blockchains and in a number of permissionless blockchains, such as Cosmos and Polkadot. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel practical system that optimizes for such realistic assumptions and achieves minimal communication and computational costs for light clients when compared to existing protocols. By means of a prototype implementation of our solution, we show that our protocol achieves a reduction by up to $90$ and $40000\times$ (respectively) in end-to-end latency and up to $1000$ and $10000\times$ (respectively) smaller proof size when compared to two state-of-the-art light client instantiations from the literature.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates data privacy by enabling collaborative in-situ training across decentralized clients. Despite its inherent advantages, FL faces significant challenges of performance and convergence when dealing with data that is not independently and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.). While previous research has primarily addressed the issue of skewed label distribution across clients, this study focuses on the less explored challenge of multi-domain FL, where client data originates from distinct domains with varying feature distributions. We introduce a novel method designed to address these challenges FedStein: Enhancing Multi-Domain Federated Learning Through the James-Stein Estimator. FedStein uniquely shares only the James-Stein (JS) estimates of batch normalization (BN) statistics across clients, while maintaining local BN parameters. The non-BN layer parameters are exchanged via standard FL techniques. Extensive experiments conducted across three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that FedStein surpasses existing methods such as FedAvg and FedBN, with accuracy improvements exceeding 14% in certain domains leading to enhanced domain generalization.

本文主要探讨了模型合并技术在大规模模型中的应用与效果。首先，研究发现当合并的专家模型源自高质量的基础模型时，合并的效果更为显著，即零样本性能较好的基础模型有助于提高合并模型的整体性能。其次，较大的模型更容易进行有效合并，这意味着大模型在合并过程中表现出更好的适应性和融合性。第三，合并模型在泛化能力上普遍表现出优势，尤其是在合并多个大型专家模型时，合并后的模型往往在未见过的任务上表现得更好，相较于多任务训练的模型。第四，随着合并的专家模型数量增加，使用更大规模的模型可以更有效地进行合并，这揭示了在合并过程中的规模效应。最后，不同合并方法在大规模场景下的行为表现相似，说明选择何种合并策略对最终模型性能的影响在大型模型中可能不是决定性的。

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple expert models into a more capable single model, offering benefits such as reduced storage and serving costs, improved generalization, and support for decentralized model development. Despite its promise, previous studies have primarily focused on merging a few small models. This leaves many unanswered questions about the effect of scaling model size and how it interplays with other key factors -- like the base model quality and number of expert models -- , to affect the merged model's performance. This work systematically evaluates the utility of model merging at scale, examining the impact of these different factors. We experiment with merging fully fine-tuned models using 4 popular merging methods -- Averaging, Task~Arithmetic, Dare, and TIES -- across model sizes ranging from 1B-64B parameters and merging up to 8 different expert models. We evaluate the merged models on both held-in tasks, i.e., the expert's training tasks, and zero-shot generalization to unseen held-out tasks. Our experiments provide several new insights about model merging at scale and the interplay between different factors. First, we find that merging is more effective when experts are created from strong base models, i.e., models with good zero-shot performance. Second, larger models facilitate easier merging. Third merging consistently improves generalization capabilities. Notably, when merging 8 large expert models, the merged models often generalize better compared to the multitask trained models. Fourth, we can better merge more expert models when working with larger models. Fifth, different merging methods behave very similarly at larger scales. Overall, our findings shed light on some interesting properties of model merging while also highlighting some limitations. We hope that this study will serve as a reference point on large-scale merging for upcoming research.

总结:
本文聚焦于大型、无许可系统中分布式共识研究的新方向，特别针对动态参与的挑战。对比传统的静态参与者模型，这类系统需要适应参与者数量和在线状态的频繁变化。比特币和“沉睡模型”等先驱工作为这一领域奠定了基础。

Momose和Ren（2022年CCS）的研究及后续工作引入了利用分级协议的总序广播机制，旨在支持动态参与度。然而，这些方法通常需要每个决策过程中的多轮投票，可能成为大规模实时系统的瓶颈。

针对这一问题，本文提出了一种新的总序广播协议——TOB-SVD，它在“沉睡模型”下工作，能够抵抗最多半数的敌对参与者。TOB-SVD的创新之处在于，它在最佳情况下只需一轮投票即可完成决策，同时实现与现有最优敌对方抗性方案相比更低的预期延迟。这项工作为在大型参与度波动的实时系统中实施更实用的总序广播协议铺平了道路。 <div>

Abstract: Over the past years, distributed consensus research has extended its focus towards addressing challenges in large-scale, permissionless systems, such as blockchains. This shift is characterized by the need to accommodate dynamic participation, contrasting the traditional approach of a static set of continuously online participants. Works like Bitcoin and the sleepy model have set the stage for this evolving framework.
  Notable contributions from Momose and Ren (CCS 2022) and subsequent works have introduced Total-Order Broadcast protocols leveraging Graded Agreement primitives and supporting dynamic participation. However, these approaches often require multiple phases of voting per decision, creating a potential bottleneck for real-world large-scale systems.
  Addressing this, our paper introduces TOB-SVD, a novel Total-Order Broadcast protocol in the sleepy model, which is resilient to up to 1/2 of adversarial participants. TOB-SVD requires only a single phase of voting per decision in the best case and achieves lower expected latency compared to existing approaches offering the same optimal adversarial resilience. This work paves the way to more practical Total-Order Broadcast protocols to be implemented in real-world systems where a large number of participants are involved simultaneously and their participation level might fluctuate over time.

Abstract: Distributed ledger technologies have opened up a wealth of fine-grained transaction data from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This allows research into problems like anomaly detection, anti-money laundering, pattern mining and activity clustering (where data from traditional currencies is rarely available). The formalism of temporal networks offers a natural way of representing this data and offers access to a wealth of metrics and models. However, the large scale of the data presents a challenge using standard graph analysis techniques. We use temporal motifs to analyse two Bitcoin datasets and one NFT dataset, using sequences of three transactions and up to three users. We show that the commonly used technique of simply counting temporal motifs over all users and all time can give misleading conclusions. Here we also study the motifs contributed by each user and discover that the motif distribution is heavy-tailed and that the key players have diverse motif signatures. We study the motifs that occur in different time periods and find events and anomalous activity that cannot be seen just by a count on the whole dataset. Studying motif completion time reveals dynamics driven by human behaviour as well as algorithmic behaviour.

Abstract: Dense passage retrieval (DPR) is the first step in the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) paradigm for improving the performance of large language models (LLM). DPR fine-tunes pre-trained networks to enhance the alignment of the embeddings between queries and relevant textual data. A deeper understanding of DPR fine-tuning will be required to fundamentally unlock the full potential of this approach. In this work, we explore DPR-trained models mechanistically by using a combination of probing, layer activation analysis, and model editing. Our experiments show that DPR training decentralizes how knowledge is stored in the network, creating multiple access pathways to the same information. We also uncover a limitation in this training style: the internal knowledge of the pre-trained model bounds what the retrieval model can retrieve. These findings suggest a few possible directions for dense retrieval: (1) expose the DPR training process to more knowledge so more can be decentralized, (2) inject facts as decentralized representations, (3) model and incorporate knowledge uncertainty in the retrieval process, and (4) directly map internal model knowledge to a knowledge base.

<div> 关键词：大型多模态语言模型、集体决策、视频分析、民主治理、去中心化自治组织

总结:

本文探讨了通过个体与集体讨论来治理大型多模态语言模型（MM-LLMs）的方法，特别关注对政治敏感视频的分析。研究分为两步：首先，与10名记者进行访谈以建立专家对视频解读的基本理解；其次，114名普通公众通过Inclusive.AI平台参与讨论，该平台通过去中心化自治组织（DAO）机制促进民主决策。

研究发现，专家侧重于情感和叙事性，而公众更重视事实清晰度、情况客观性和情感中立性。此外，研究还探索了不同治理机制的影响，如二次投票与加权排名投票以及平等与20-80权力分配对用户决策的影响。结果显示，二次投票增强了对自由民主和平等政治的看法，而对AI持乐观态度的参与者认为投票过程具有更高的参与式民主水平。

本文建议将DAO机制应用于AI治理，以实现民主化，让AI的行为决策更加公正和透明。 <div>

Abstract: This paper examines the governance of multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) through individual and collective deliberation, focusing on analyses of politically sensitive videos. We conducted a two-step study: first, interviews with 10 journalists established a baseline understanding of expert video interpretation; second, 114 individuals from the general public engaged in deliberation using Inclusive.AI, a platform that facilitates democratic decision-making through decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) mechanisms. Our findings show that while experts emphasized emotion and narrative, the general public prioritized factual clarity, objectivity of the situation, and emotional neutrality. Additionally, we explored the impact of different governance mechanisms: quadratic vs. weighted ranking voting and equal vs. 20-80 power distributions on users decision-making on how AI should behave. Specifically, quadratic voting enhanced perceptions of liberal democracy and political equality, and participants who were more optimistic about AI perceived the voting process to have a higher level of participatory democracy. Our results suggest the potential of applying DAO mechanisms to help democratize AI governance.

总结:

本文探讨了分散式联邦学习(Distributed Federated Learning, DFL)领域的一个关键挑战——数据异质性。在没有中央服务器或原始数据交换的情况下，参与者合作训练模型。研究发现，传统的梯度下降方法在处理数据异质性方面存在局限性，而神经张量核(NTK)方法在集中式框架下的应用可以显著提高性能。

文章提出了一种利用NTK在分散式环境中训练客户端模型的新策略，并引入了NTK驱动的演化与模型平均之间的协同作用。这种协同作用通过利用模型间的差异来提升准确性和收敛速度，特别是在数据高度异质性的场景中。文中提出的方法在多个基准测试中显示出了明显的性能优势，尤其是在对比其他方法在高度异质性环境中的表现时，其准确性提升了至少10%，并且在达到目标性能所需通信轮数上减少了4.6倍。

此外，该方法的稳健性和普适性得到了多组数据集、网络拓扑结构和不同异质性设置的验证，确保了其在各种条件下的可靠性和广泛适用性。 <div>

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is a collaborative machine learning framework for training a model across participants without a central server or raw data exchange. DFL faces challenges due to statistical heterogeneity, as participants often possess different data distributions reflecting local environments and user behaviors. Recent work has shown that the neural tangent kernel (NTK) approach, when applied to federated learning in a centralized framework, can lead to improved performance. The NTK-based update mechanism is more expressive than typical gradient descent methods, enabling more efficient convergence and better handling of data heterogeneity. We propose an approach leveraging the NTK to train client models in the decentralized setting, while introducing a synergy between NTK-based evolution and model averaging. This synergy exploits inter-model variance and improves both accuracy and convergence in heterogeneous settings. Our model averaging technique significantly enhances performance, boosting accuracy by at least 10% compared to the mean local model accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves higher accuracy than baselines in highly heterogeneous settings, where other approaches often underperform. Additionally, it reaches target performance in 4.6 times fewer communication rounds. We validate our approach across multiple datasets, network topologies, and heterogeneity settings to ensure robustness and generalizability.

Abstract: Crisis management (CM) for critical infrastructures, natural disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes, terrorist actions, or civil unrest requires high speed communications and connectivity, and access to high performance computational resources to deliver timely dynamic responses to the crisis being managed by different first responders. CM systems should detect, recognize, and disseminate huge amounts of heterogeneous dynamic events that operate at different speeds and formats. Furthermore, the processing of crisis events and the development of real-time responses are major research challenges when the communications and computational resources needed by CM stakeholders are not available or severely degraded by the crisis. The main goal of the research presented in this paper is to utilize Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UAS) to provide Aerial-based Crisis Management Center (ACMC) that will provide the required communications services and the computational resources that are critically needed by first responders. In our approach to develop an ACMC architecture, we utilize a set of flexible Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) that can be dynamically composed to meet the communications and computational requirements of CM tasks. The ACMC services will be modeled as a deep neural network (DNN) mass transport approach to cover a distributed target in a decentralized manner. This is indeed a new decentralized coverage approach with time-varying communication weights. Furthermore, our analysis proves the stability and convergence of the proposed DNN-based mass transport for a team of UAS (e.g., quadcopters), where each quadcopter uses a feedback nonlinear control to independently attain the intended coverage trajectory in a decentralized manner.

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized collaborative training paradigm that preserves stakeholders' data ownership while improving performance and generalization. However, statistical heterogeneity among client datasets poses a fundamental challenge by degrading system performance. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Normalization-free Feature Recalibration (ANFR), an architecture-level approach that combines weight standardization and channel attention. Weight standardization normalizes the weights of layers instead of activations. This is less susceptible to mismatched client statistics and inconsistent averaging, thereby more robust under heterogeneity. Channel attention produces learnable scaling factors for feature maps, suppressing those that are inconsistent between clients due to heterogeneity. We demonstrate that combining these techniques boosts model performance beyond their individual contributions, by enhancing class selectivity and optimizing channel attention weight distribution. ANFR operates independently of the aggregation method and is effective in both global and personalized federated learning settings, with minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, when training with differential privacy, ANFR achieves an appealing balance between privacy and utility, enabling strong privacy guarantees without sacrificing performance. By integrating weight standardization and channel attention in the backbone model, ANFR offers a novel and versatile approach to the challenge of statistical heterogeneity. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that ANFR consistently outperforms established baselines across various aggregation methods, datasets, and heterogeneity conditions.

Abstract: Cross-chain bridges are widely used blockchain interoperability mechanisms. However, several of these bridges have vulnerabilities that have caused 3.2 billion dollars in losses since May 2021. Some studies have revealed the existence of these vulnerabilities, but little quantitative research is available, and there are no safeguard mechanisms to protect bridges from such attacks. We propose XChainWatcher, the first mechanism for monitoring bridges and detecting attacks against them. XChainWatcher relies on a cross-chain model powered by a Datalog engine, designed to be pluggable into any cross-chain bridge. Analyzing data from the Ronin and Nomad bridges, we successfully identified the transactions that led to losses of \$611M and \$190M USD, respectively. XChainWatcher not only uncovers successful attacks but also reveals unintended behavior, such as 37 cross-chain transactions (cctx) that these bridges should not have accepted, failed attempts to exploit Nomad, over \$7.8M locked on one chain but never released on Ethereum, and \$200K lost due to inadequate interaction with bridges. We provide the first open-source dataset of 81,000 cctxs across three blockchains, capturing \$585M and \$3.7B in token transfers in Nomad and Ronin, respectively.

Abstract: Like any other useful technology, cryptocurrencies are sometimes used for criminal activities. While transactions are recorded on the blockchain, there exists a need for a more rapid and scalable method to detect addresses associated with fraudulent activities. We present RiskSEA, a scalable risk scoring system capable of effectively handling the dynamic nature of large-scale blockchain transaction graphs. The risk scoring system, which we implement for Ethereum, consists of 1. a scalable approach to generating node2vec embedding for entire set of addresses to capture the graph topology 2. transaction-based features to capture the transactional behavioral pattern of an address 3. a classifier model to generate risk score for addresses that combines the node2vec embedding and behavioral features. Efficiently generating node2vec embedding for large scale and dynamically evolving blockchain transaction graphs is challenging, we present two novel approaches for generating node2vec embeddings and effectively scaling it to the entire set of blockchain addresses: 1. node2vec embedding propagation and 2. dynamic node2vec embedding. We present a comprehensive analysis of the proposed approaches. Our experiments show that combining both behavioral and node2vec features boosts the classification performance significantly, and that the dynamic node2vec embeddings perform better than the node2vec propagated embeddings.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of smartphones and Location-Based Social Networks has led to a massive influx of spatio-temporal data, creating unparalleled opportunities for enhancing Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation systems. These advanced POI systems are crucial for enriching user experiences, enabling personalized interactions, and optimizing decision-making processes in the digital landscape. However, existing surveys tend to focus on traditional approaches and few of them delve into cutting-edge developments, emerging architectures, as well as security considerations in POI recommendations. To address this gap, our survey stands out by offering a comprehensive, up-to-date review of POI recommendation systems, covering advancements in models, architectures, and security aspects. We systematically examine the transition from traditional models to advanced techniques such as large language models. Additionally, we explore the architectural evolution from centralized to decentralized and federated learning systems, highlighting the improvements in scalability and privacy. Furthermore, we address the increasing importance of security, examining potential vulnerabilities and privacy-preserving approaches. Our taxonomy provides a structured overview of the current state of POI recommendation, while we also identify promising directions for future research in this rapidly advancing field.

Abstract: Decentralized learning (DL) is an emerging approach that enables nodes to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing raw data. In many application domains, such as healthcare, this approach faces challenges due to the high level of heterogeneity in the training data's feature space. Such feature heterogeneity lowers model utility and negatively impacts fairness, particularly for nodes with under-represented training data. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Facade}, a clustering-based DL algorithm specifically designed for fair model training when the training data exhibits several distinct features. The challenge of \textsc{Facade} is to assign nodes to clusters, one for each feature, based on the similarity in the features of their local data, without requiring individual nodes to know apriori which cluster they belong to. \textsc{Facade} (1) dynamically assigns nodes to their appropriate clusters over time, and (2) enables nodes to collaboratively train a specialized model for each cluster in a fully decentralized manner. We theoretically prove the convergence of \textsc{Facade}, implement our algorithm, and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines. Our experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of model accuracy and fairness compared to all three competitors. Compared to the best-performing baseline, \textsc{Facade} on the CIFAR-10 dataset also reduces communication costs by 32.3\% to reach a target accuracy when cluster sizes are imbalanced.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning an approximate equilibrium in the offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) setting. We introduce a structural assumption -- the interaction rank -- and establish that functions with low interaction rank are significantly more robust to distribution shift compared to general ones. Leveraging this observation, we demonstrate that utilizing function classes with low interaction rank, when combined with regularization and no-regret learning, admits decentralized, computationally and statistically efficient learning in offline MARL. Our theoretical results are complemented by experiments that showcase the potential of critic architectures with low interaction rank in offline MARL, contrasting with commonly used single-agent value decomposition architectures.

Abstract: Between 2021 and 2023, crypto assets valued at over \$US2.6 billion were stolen via attacks on "bridges" -- decentralized services designed to allow inter-blockchain exchange. While the individual exploits in each attack vary, a single design flaw underlies them all: the lack of end-to-end value accounting in cross-chain transactions. In this paper, we empirically analyze twenty million transactions used by key bridges during this period. We show that a simple invariant that balances cross-chain inflows and outflows is compatible with legitimate use, yet precisely identifies every known attack (and several likely attacks) in this data. Further, we show that this approach is not only sufficient for post-hoc audits, but can be implemented in-line in existing bridge designs to provide generic protection against a broad array of bridge vulnerabilities.

Abstract: This paper serves as a correction to the conference version. In this work, we explore uplink communication in cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MaMIMO) systems, employing semi-blind transmission structures to mitigate pilot contamination. We propose a simplified, decentralized method based on Expectation Propagation (EP) for semi-blind channel estimation. By utilizing orthogonal pilots, we preprocess the received signals to establish a simplified equivalent factorization scheme for the transmission process. Moreover, this study integrates Central Limit Theory (CLT) with EP, eliminating the need to introduce new auxiliary variables in the factorization scheme. We also refine the algorithm by assessing the variable scales involved. Finally, a decentralized approach is proposed to significantly reduce the computational demands on the Central Processing Unit (CPU).

Abstract: Edge signal processing facilitates distributed learning and inference in the client-server model proposed in federated learning. In traditional machine learning, clients (IoT devices) that acquire raw signal samples can aid a data center (server) learn a global signal model by pooling these distributed samples at a third-party location. Despite the promising capabilities of IoTs, these distributed deployments often face the challenge of sensitive private data and communication rate constraints. This necessitates a learning approach that communicates a processed approximation of the distributed samples instead of the raw signals. Such a decentralized learning approach using signal approximations will be termed distributed signal analytics in this work. Overpredictive signal approximations may be desired for distributed signal analytics, especially in network demand (capacity) planning applications motivated by federated learning. In this work, we propose algorithms that compute an overpredictive signal approximation at the client devices using an efficient convex optimization framework. Tradeoffs between communication cost, sampling rate, and the signal approximation error are quantified using mathematical analysis. We also show the performance of the proposed distributed algorithms on a publicly available residential energy consumption dataset.

<div> 关键词：存储成本、区块链、Luby Transform（LT）编码、分布式网络、安全漏洞

总结:

本文研究了编码区块链技术在降低存储成本和促进可扩展性方面的重要性。文章首先指出传统的Luby Transform（LT）解码器如信念传播和在线飞行高斯消元法可能不适合具有不同计算和下载能力的异构网络。为了解决这个问题，作者提出了一种混合解码器家族，并为它们制定了最优操作模式以在最低解码成本下恢复区块链。

接着，文章指出了编码区块链架构在存储节省和可扩展性方面的研究，但对安全性漏洞了解不足的问题。作者提出了针对具有特定解码能力节点的新颖拒绝服务攻击，这些攻击旨在阻止节点加入网络。所提出的攻击是非盲目的，攻击者可以访问存档块并基于编码方案选择要执行攻击的部分块集。文章显示，优化的攻击能够与盲攻击达到相同的破坏水平，但所需的资源却有限。

最后，本文为设计同时提供存储节省、可扩展性和对抗优化威胁的编码区块链开辟了新的研究方向。 <div>

Abstract: Coded blockchains have acquired prominence as a promising solution to reduce storage costs and facilitate scalability. Within this class, Luby Transform (LT) coded blockchains are an appealing choice for scalability owing to the availability of a wide range of low-complexity decoders. In the first part of this work, we identify that traditional LT decoders like Belief Propagation and On-the-Fly Gaussian Elimination may not be optimal for heterogeneous networks with nodes that have varying computational and download capabilities. To address this, we introduce a family of hybrid decoders for LT codes and propose optimal operating regimes for them to recover the blockchain at the lowest decoding cost. While LT coded blockchain architecture has been studied from the aspects of storage savings and scalability, not much is known in terms of its security vulnerabilities. Pointing at this research gap, in the second part, we present novel denial-of-service threats on LT coded blockchains that target nodes with specific decoding capabilities, preventing them from joining the network. Our proposed threats are non-oblivious in nature, wherein adversaries gain access to the archived blocks, and choose to execute their attack on a subset of them based on underlying coding scheme. We show that our optimized threats can achieve the same level of damage as that of blind attacks, however, with limited amount of resources. Overall, this is the first work of its kind that opens up new questions on designing coded blockchains to jointly provide storage savings, scalability and also resilience to optimized threats.

<div> 关键词：文章、讨论、策略、印度国家转型机构、电子与信息技术部

<br /><br />
总结:

本文详细分析了印度国家转型机构(NITI Aayog)的一份讨论文件和电子与信息技术部(MeitY)的一份策略文件，这两份文件都强调了区块链技术在印度的非金融应用案例。研究发现，从文件中的语言表述可以看出，印度政府对区块链的理解经历了从强调透明度到信任，再到可调整的透明性的转变。这一转变不仅反映出区块链技术被定义为“去中心化”，但实际上却有强化中央控制的趋势，即政府重新定位自己作为中介角色。文中还指出，关于信任、透明度、(去)中心化和(去)中介化的论述是理解新兴社会技术系统再描述的关键领域。

通过这些讨论，文章揭示了政府在区块链政策制定过程中的角色转变和战略调整，以及这些调整如何影响技术的实施和应用。此外，它还强调了政府如何在理论上推崇技术的去中心化特性，但在实践中却倾向于强化其自身的作用，这涉及到对区块链技术潜在功能的复杂再解释。整体而言，该文旨在探讨技术政策制定中话语的力量及其对技术发展和应用的影响。 <div>

Abstract: The article closely reads a discussion paper by the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog and a strategy paper by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) advocating non-financial use cases of blockchain in India. By noting the discursive shift from transparency to trust to adjustably transparent enacted in these two documents, and consequently the Indian state's redescription of blockchain, the paper foregrounds how blockchain systems are being designated as "decentral" but have recentralizing effects where the state reinvents and re-establishes itself as an intermediary. The paper illustrates how discursive shifts concerning trust, transparency, (de)centralization and (dis)intermediation are crucial sites for investigating redescriptions of emerging sociotechnical systems.

<div> 关键词：分散式优化、通信延迟、虚拟节点、共识算法、时间变异性

总结:

本文探讨了受通信延迟影响的网络中的分散式优化问题。通过引入虚拟非计算节点，构建了具有方向性的图结构，以此来模拟通信延迟。现有的解决方案往往假设节点已知其出度数，这限制了其应用范围。为克服这一局限性，本文提出了一种新颖的基于问候的算法——DT-GO，该算法无需知晓出度数即可应用于一般的方向性网络，如具有延迟或有限确认能力的网络。

对于凸性和非凸性目标函数，本文推导了收敛率，表明该算法在复杂度上与集中式随机梯度下降法具有相同的阶数。换句话说，图拓扑和延迟的影响仅体现在高阶项中。此外，分析还考虑了网络拓扑随时间变化的情况。为了支持理论发现，提供了数值仿真结果。 <div>

Abstract: We consider a decentralized optimization problem for networks affected by communication delays. Examples of such networks include collaborative machine learning, sensor networks, and multi-agent systems. To mimic communication delays, we add virtual non-computing nodes to the network, resulting in directed graphs. This motivates investigating decentralized optimization solutions on directed graphs. Existing solutions assume nodes know their out-degrees, resulting in limited applicability. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel gossip-based algorithm, called DT-GO, that does not need to know the out-degrees. The algorithm is applicable in general directed networks, for example networks with delays or limited acknowledgment capabilities. We derive convergence rates for both convex and non-convex objectives, showing that our algorithm achieves the same complexity order as centralized Stochastic Gradient Descent. In other words, the effects of the graph topology and delays are confined to higher-order terms. Additionally, we extend our analysis to accommodate time-varying network topologies. Numerical simulations are provided to support our theoretical findings.

<div> 关键词：人工智能、物联网、医疗健康、机器学习、深度学习

总结:

本文探讨了人工智能（AI）与互联网医疗事物（IoMT）在医疗健康领域的应用，特别是通过机器学习（ML）和深度学习（DL）技术在慢性疾病预测与诊断方面的进展。AI驱动的模型如XGBoost、随机森林、卷积神经网络（CNNs）和长短期记忆循环神经网络（LSTM RNNs）在心脏病、慢性肾病（CKD）、阿尔茨海默症和肺癌的预测上取得了超过98%的准确率，数据来源包括Kaggle、UCI、私人机构和实时IoMT资源。

然而，这一领域仍面临挑战，包括数据质量的差异、患者人口统计学的多样性以及来自不同医院和研究来源的数据格式不一致。整合来自广泛且异构的IoMT数据增加了确保互操作性和保护患者隐私的复杂性。AI模型经常遇到过拟合问题，尽管在受控环境中表现良好，但在实际临床环境中效果较差。对于多病共存的情况，尤其是罕见疾病如痴呆症、中风和癌症的研究不足。未来的研究应集中在数据标准化和高级预处理技术上，以提高数据质量和互操作性。迁移学习和集成方法对于提高跨临床环境的模型泛化能力至关重要。此外，需要探索疾病之间的相互作用并开发慢性疾病交集的预测模型。创建标准化框架和开源工具，将联邦学习、区块链和差分隐私融入IoMT系统，将确保数据隐私和安全。 <div>

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) in healthcare, through Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, has advanced the prediction and diagnosis of chronic diseases. AI-driven models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, CNNs, and LSTM RNNs have achieved over 98\% accuracy in predicting heart disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), Alzheimer's disease, and lung cancer, using datasets from platforms like Kaggle, UCI, private institutions, and real-time IoMT sources. However, challenges persist due to variations in data quality, patient demographics, and formats from different hospitals and research sources. The incorporation of IoMT data, which is vast and heterogeneous, adds complexities in ensuring interoperability and security to protect patient privacy. AI models often struggle with overfitting, performing well in controlled environments but less effectively in real-world clinical settings. Moreover, multi-morbidity scenarios especially for rare diseases like dementia, stroke, and cancers remain insufficiently addressed. Future research should focus on data standardization and advanced preprocessing techniques to improve data quality and interoperability. Transfer learning and ensemble methods are crucial for improving model generalizability across clinical settings. Additionally, the exploration of disease interactions and the development of predictive models for chronic illness intersections is needed. Creating standardized frameworks and open-source tools for integrating federated learning, blockchain, and differential privacy into IoMT systems will also ensure robust data privacy and security.

总结:

本文提出了一种名为FibecFed的高效课程联邦学习框架，旨在通过利用Federated Learning（FL）在分布式数据上协作训练模型。针对大型语言模型（LLMs）参数量巨大和训练数据非独立同分布（non-IID）的问题，FibecFed引入了两个创新方法：自适应联邦课程学习和高效的稀疏参数更新。

首先，文章提出了基于费雪信息的方法，用于在每个设备上适当地采样数据，以提高FL微调过程的有效性。其次，通过动态选择合适的层进行全局聚合以及为本地更新选择合适的稀疏参数，FibecFed进一步优化了FL微调过程的效率。

Abstract: As a promising paradigm to collaboratively train models with decentralized data, Federated Learning (FL) can be exploited to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs correspond to huge size, the scale of the training data significantly increases, which leads to tremendous amounts of computation and communication costs. The training data is generally non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID), which requires adaptive data processing within each device. Although Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can significantly reduce the scale of parameters to update in the fine-tuning process, it still takes unaffordable time to transfer the low-rank parameters of all the layers in LLMs. In this paper, we propose a Fisher Information-based Efficient Curriculum Federated Learning framework (FibecFed) with two novel methods, i.e., adaptive federated curriculum learning and efficient sparse parameter update. First, we propose a fisher information-based method to adaptively sample data within each device to improve the effectiveness of the FL fine-tuning process. Second, we dynamically select the proper layers for global aggregation and sparse parameters for local update with LoRA so as to improve the efficiency of the FL fine-tuning process. Extensive experimental results based on 10 datasets demonstrate that FibecFed yields excellent performance (up to 45.35% in terms of accuracy) and superb fine-tuning speed (up to 98.61% faster) compared with 17 baseline approaches).

总结:

本文研究了在分布式系统中，特别是在具有异构传感器网络和动态拓扑结构的情况下，面对未知输入时的状态估计问题。传统的共识算法往往需要大量的信息交换或多次通信迭代来确保估计的准确性。文章提出了一种高效算法，该算法通过信息滤波分解和协方差交集的输入融合实现了与拥有其他代理完整信息的滤波器相媲美的无偏置、最优解。这一方法只需要一次通信迭代来交换个体估计值，避免了分享明确观察和系统方程，从而保护了代理的隐私。

此外，针对动态通信拓扑带来的挑战，文章提出了两种实用策略来处理因间歇性观测和不完整状态估计导致的问题，以增强估计过程的鲁棒性和准确性。实验和消融研究在静态和动态环境中均表明，该算法优于其他基准，并且在某些情况下甚至表现得更好于那些拥有所有邻居全局视图的算法。 <div>

Abstract: A crucial challenge in decentralized systems is state estimation in the presence of unknown inputs, particularly within heterogeneous sensor networks with dynamic topologies. While numerous consensus algorithms have been introduced, they often require extensive information exchange or multiple communication iterations to ensure estimation accuracy. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm that achieves an unbiased and optimal solution comparable to filters with full information about other agents. This is accomplished through the use of information filter decomposition and the fusion of inputs via covariance intersection. Our method requires only a single communication iteration for exchanging individual estimates between agents, instead of multiple rounds of information exchange, thus preserving agents' privacy by avoiding the sharing of explicit observations and system equations. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by dynamic communication topologies, we propose two practical strategies to handle issues arising from intermittent observations and incomplete state estimation, thereby enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the estimation process. Experiments and ablation studies conducted in both stationary and dynamic environments demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over other baselines. Notably, it performs as well as, or even better than, algorithms that have a global view of all neighbors.

总结:

本文提出了一种基于静态分析与多目标优化算法的智能合约漏洞检测方法。该方法主要针对四种类型的漏洞进行检测，包括重入性（reentrancy）、调用栈溢出（call stack overflow）、整数溢出（integer overflow）和时间戳依赖（timestamp dependency）。首先，通过编译将智能合约转化为抽象语法树（AST），以此来分析合约之间的关系，如调用、继承和数据流等，并将其转化为静态评估和中间表示，以揭示内部关系。然后，通过对函数、变量和数据依赖性的检查，识别上述四种漏洞。

为了提高检测的准确性和覆盖率，文章引入了多目标优化算法。该算法对初始输入数据赋予数值，并监控语句覆盖度和检测准确度的变化。使用覆盖度和准确度作为适应度值，通过计算帕累托前沿和拥挤距离来选择最佳个体用于下一代父群体的生成，直至满足优化条件。实验结果表明，与现有最先进的工具相比，该方法在覆盖度、准确度、效率和检测效果方面均表现出色。

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts using static analysis and a multi-objective optimization algorithm. We focus on four types of vulnerabilities: reentrancy, call stack overflow, integer overflow, and timestamp dependencies. Initially, smart contracts are compiled into an abstract syntax tree to analyze relationships between contracts and functions, including calls, inheritance, and data flow. These analyses are transformed into static evaluations and intermediate representations that reveal internal relations. Based on these representations, we examine contract's functions, variables, and data dependencies to detect the specified vulnerabilities. To enhance detection accuracy and coverage, we apply a multi-objective optimization algorithm to the static analysis process. This involves assigning initial numeric values to input data and monitoring changes in statement coverage and detection accuracy. Using coverage and accuracy as fitness values, we calculate Pareto front and crowding distance values to select the best individuals for the new parent population, iterating until optimization criteria are met. We validate our approach using an open-source dataset collected from Etherscan, containing 6,693 smart contracts. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art tools in terms of coverage, accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness in detecting the targeted vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Blockchain technology holds promise for Web 3.0, but scalability remains a critical challenge. Here, we present a mathematical theory for a novel blockchain network topology based on fractal N-dimensional simplexes. This Hyper-simplex fractal network folds one-dimensional data blocks into geometric shapes, reflecting both underlying and overlaying network connectivities. Our approach offers near-infinite scalability, accommodating trillions of nodes while maintaining efficiency.
  We derive the mathematical foundations for generating and describing these network topologies, proving key properties such as node count, connectivity patterns, and fractal dimension. The resulting structure facilitates a hierarchical consensus mechanism and enables deterministic address mapping for rapid routing. This theoretical framework lays the groundwork for next-generation blockchain architectures, potentially revolutionizing large-scale decentralized systems. The Part I work was conducted between March and September 2024.

Abstract: The proliferation of spam on the Web has necessitated the development of machine learning models to automate their detection. However, the dynamic nature of spam and the sophisticated evasion techniques employed by spammers often lead to low accuracy in these models. Traditional machine-learning approaches struggle to keep pace with spammers' constantly evolving tactics, resulting in a persistent challenge to maintain high detection rates. To address this, we propose blockchain-enabled incentivized crowdsourcing as a novel solution to enhance spam detection systems. We create an incentive mechanism for data collection and labeling by leveraging blockchain's decentralized and transparent framework. Contributors are rewarded for accurate labels and penalized for inaccuracies, ensuring high-quality data. A smart contract governs the submission and evaluation process, with participants staking cryptocurrency as collateral to guarantee integrity. Simulations show that incentivized crowdsourcing improves data quality, leading to more effective machine-learning models for spam detection. This approach offers a scalable and adaptable solution to the challenges of traditional methods.

Abstract: This paper reviews the applications of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in blockchain technology. As the complexity and adoption of blockchain networks continue to grow, traditional analytical methods are proving inadequate in capturing the intricate relationships and dynamic behaviors of decentralized systems. To address these limitations, deep learning models such as GNNs, GCNs, and CNNs offer robust solutions by leveraging the unique graph-based and temporal structures inherent in blockchain architectures. GNNs and GCNs, in particular, excel in modeling the relational data of blockchain nodes and transactions, making them ideal for applications such as fraud detection, transaction verification, and smart contract analysis. Meanwhile, CNNs can be adapted to analyze blockchain data when represented as structured matrices, revealing hidden temporal and spatial patterns in transaction flows. This paper explores how these models enhance the efficiency, security, and scalability of both linear blockchains and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based systems, providing a comprehensive overview of their strengths and future research directions. By integrating advanced neural network techniques, we aim to demonstrate the potential of these models in revolutionizing blockchain analytics, paving the way for more sophisticated decentralized applications and improved network performance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows multiple decentralized clients to collaboratively learn a common model without sharing local data. Although local data is not exposed directly, privacy concerns nonetheless exist as clients' sensitive information can be inferred from intermediate computations. Moreover, such information leakage accumulates substantially over time as the same data is repeatedly used during the iterative learning process. As a result, it can be particularly difficult to balance the privacy-accuracy trade-off when designing privacy-preserving FL algorithms. This paper introduces Upcycled-FL, a simple yet effective strategy that applies first-order approximation at every even round of model update. Under this strategy, half of the FL updates incur no information leakage and require much less computational and transmission costs. We first conduct the theoretical analysis on the convergence (rate) of Upcycled-FL and then apply two perturbation mechanisms to preserve privacy. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the Upcycled-FL strategy can be adapted to many existing FL frameworks and consistently improve the privacy-accuracy trade-off.

<div> 关键词：Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), 协议设计空间, EIP-1559, 动态机制, 目标值

总结:

本文探讨了区块链系统中一个新兴领域——最大可提取价值（MEV）的设计问题。MEV是区块生产者通过操纵交易顺序以获取利润的一种方式。研究提出将MEV提取率纳入协议设计空间，旨在通过动态调整该参数来平衡区块生产者和用户的利益。借鉴EIP-1559的思路，设计了一种动态机制，目标是使MEV提取率稳定在一个预定值上。

研究发现，该动态机制在特定参数下能确保向目标值收敛，但在其他情况下可能出现不稳定甚至混沌现象。然而，在一般条件下，系统会在目标均衡点附近集中，显示出长期性能的稳定性。

这项工作首次提出了动态框架来解决MEV在区块生产者与用户之间的共享问题，为MEV管理提供了理论基础和实践指导。通过动态调整MEV提取率，可以实现更公平合理的利益分配，促进区块链系统的健康发展。 <div>

Abstract: Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) has emerged as a new frontier in the design of blockchain systems. In this paper, we propose making the MEV extraction rate as part of the protocol design space. Our aim is to leverage this parameter to maintain a healthy balance between block producers (who need to be compensated) and users (who need to feel encouraged to transact). We follow the approach introduced by EIP-1559 and design a similar mechanism to dynamically update the MEV extraction rate with the goal of stabilizing it at a target value. We study the properties of this dynamic mechanism and show that, while convergence to the target can be guaranteed for certain parameters, instability, and even chaos, can occur in other cases. Despite these complexities, under general conditions, the system concentrates in a neighborhood of the target equilibrium implying high long-term performance. Our work establishes, the first to our knowledge, dynamic framework for the integral problem of MEV sharing between extractors and users.

Abstract: The Financial system has witnessed rapid technological changes. The rise of Bitcoin and other crypto assets based on Distributed Ledger Technology mark a fundamental change in the way people transact and transmit value over a decentralized network, spread across geographies. This has created regulatory and tax policy blind spots, as governments and tax administrations take time to understand and provide policy responses to this innovative, revolutionary, and fast-paced technology. Due to the breakneck speed of innovation in blockchain technology and advent of Decentralized Finance, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and the Metaverse, it is unlikely that the policy interventions and guidance by regulatory authorities or tax administrations would be ahead or in sync with the pace of innovation. This paper tries to explain the principles on which crypto assets function, their underlying technology and relates them to the tax issues and taxable events which arise within this ecosystem. It also provides instances of tax and regulatory policy responses already in effect in various jurisdictions, including the recent changes in reporting standards by the FATF and the OECD. This paper tries to explain the rationale behind existing laws and policies and the challenges in their implementation. It also attempts to present a ballpark estimate of tax potential of this asset class and suggests creation of global public digital infrastructure that can address issues related to pseudonymity and extra-territoriality. The paper analyses both direct and indirect taxation issues related to crypto assets and discusses more recent aspects like proof-of-stake and maximal extractable value in greater detail.

<div> 关键词：自主权身份、去中心化身份、欧洲数字身份框架、开放身份认证、Web3

总结:

本文旨在澄清“自主权身份”(SSI)与“去中心化身份”之间的概念差异，特别是在修订后的《关于建立欧盟数字身份框架（eIDAS 2.0）》背景下。研究采用了归纳探索性方法，历时九个月，收集了从2005年到2024年的相关文献。

研究发现，去中心化身份领域在OpenID Connect（OIDC）的开放身份认证范式旁发展，而SSI则标志着该领域的转向区块链解决方案。文章指出，将SSI和去中心化身份混用与OIDC上的新协议相重合。

第一部分区分了OIDC与去中心化身份，强调了它们在技术上的区别。第二部分探讨了OIDC在eIDAS 2.0下的局限性以及与Web3的不兼容性。

最后，文章建议进一步研究以建立一个数字身份桥梁，连接基于公共无权限的区块链的应用程序与eIDAS 2.0提供的数据，以及使用OIDC进行展示的数据。这一研究成果有助于推动数字身份领域的标准化与互操作性，促进不同技术平台之间的融合与协同作用。 <div>

Abstract: The terms self-sovereign identity (SSI) and decentralised identity are often used interchangeably, which results in increasing ambiguity when solutions are being investigated and compared. This article aims to provide a clear distinction between the two concepts in relation to the revised Regulation as Regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework (eIDAS 2.0) by providing a systematisation of knowledge of technological developments that led up to implementation of eIDAS 2.0. Applying an inductive exploratory approach, relevant literature was selected iteratively in waves over a nine months time frame and covers literature between 2005 and 2024. The review found that the decentralised identity sector emerged adjacent to the OpenID Connect (OIDC) paradigm of Open Authentication, whereas SSI denotes the sector's shift towards blockchain-based solutions. In this study, it is shown that the interchangeable use of SSI and decentralised identity coincides with novel protocols over OIDC. While the first part of this paper distinguishes OIDC from decentralised identity, the second part addresses the incompatibility between OIDC under eIDAS 2.0 and Web3. The paper closes by suggesting further research for establishing a digital identity bridge for connecting applications on public-permissionless ledgers with data originating from eIDAS 2.0 and being presented using OIDC.

<div> 关键词：生成式AI、敏感信息、数据泄露、模型提供者、分布式计算

总结:

文章讨论了随着生成式人工智能工具的使用激增，敏感信息暴露给这些模型和中央模型提供商的问题日益严重。例如，三星的机密源代码通过ChatGPT的文本提示遭遇数据泄露就是一个实例。越来越多的公司因为数据泄露或保密问题而限制了大型语言模型（LLMs）的使用，包括苹果、Verizon、摩根大通等。此外，一些集中式的生成模型提供商也在限制、过滤、对齐或审查可以使用的数据。

针对这一问题，作者提出了一种安全且私密的方法来处理生成式人工智能，以防止敏感数据或模型暴露给第三方AI供应商。该方法修改了现代生成式AI算法的关键组成部分，如变换器，并引入了分布式网络中的保密和可验证多方计算。这不仅保护了用户输入的隐私和模型输出的混淆，还为模型本身引入了隐私性。分片过程减少了任何单个节点的计算负担，使得大型生成式AI进程的资源能够分散到多个较小的节点上。研究显示，只要计算中存在一个诚实的节点，安全性就能得到保障。同时，即使只有计算中大多数节点成功，推理过程仍然可以成功进行。因此，这种方法在分布式网络中提供了安全且可验证的计算能力。 <div>

Abstract: As usage of generative AI tools skyrockets, the amount of sensitive information being exposed to these models and centralized model providers is alarming. For example, confidential source code from Samsung suffered a data leak as the text prompt to ChatGPT encountered data leakage. An increasing number of companies are restricting the use of LLMs (Apple, Verizon, JPMorgan Chase, etc.) due to data leakage or confidentiality issues. Also, an increasing number of centralized generative model providers are restricting, filtering, aligning, or censoring what can be used. Midjourney and RunwayML, two of the major image generation platforms, restrict the prompts to their system via prompt filtering. Certain political figures are restricted from image generation, as well as words associated with women's health care, rights, and abortion.
  In our research, we present a secure and private methodology for generative artificial intelligence that does not expose sensitive data or models to third-party AI providers. Our work modifies the key building block of modern generative AI algorithms, e.g. the transformer, and introduces confidential and verifiable multiparty computations in a decentralized network to maintain the 1) privacy of the user input and obfuscation to the output of the model, and 2) introduce privacy to the model itself. Additionally, the sharding process reduces the computational burden on any one node, enabling the distribution of resources of large generative AI processes across multiple, smaller nodes. We show that as long as there exists one honest node in the decentralized computation, security is maintained. We also show that the inference process will still succeed if only a majority of the nodes in the computation are successful. Thus, our method offers both secure and verifiable computation in a decentralized network.

<div> 关键词：Byzantine Fault Tolerant、Mempool、Coding Techniques、Fast-HotStuff、Throughput

总结:

本文提出了一种名为IM（Mempool）的新颖共识协议，旨在提升拜占庭容错（BFT）共识机制在故障节点和网络不稳定环境下的性能。通过将微块组织成链并结合编码技术，IM协议能够高效实现一致性与可用性。该协议易于集成到现有的BFT协议中，以增强其性能。

作为示例，作者将IM与Fast-HotStuff协议结合，形成了IM-FHS，该协议具备保持顺序、带宽适应性和抵抗过量分布等特性。在具有最高可达256个节点的系统中进行了IM-FHS的实验验证，结果显示，相比于当前最先进的Stratus-FHS协议，IM-FHS在处理故障节点时表现出更高的吞吐量和更小的延迟。随着故障节点数量的增加，IM-FHS的吞吐量优势更加显著。在100个节点中有33个故障节点的系统中，IM-FHS的吞吐量几乎是Stratus-FHS的9倍，同时保持了1/10的延迟水平，充分展示了其在高容错性场景下的优越性能。 <div>

Abstract: Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus, a crucial component of blockchains, has made significant advancements. However, the efficiency of existing protocols can still be damaged by certain attacks from faulty nodes and network instability. In this paper, we propose a novel Shared Mempool (SMP) protocol, namely IM, that enhances performance under these attacks. Technically, IM organizing microblocks into chains, combined with coding techniques, achieves totality and availability efficiently. IM can be easily integrated into a BFT protocol. We take Fast-HotStuff as an example and obtain the IM-FHS with guarantees of \emph{order keeping}, \emph{bandwidth adaptability} and \emph{over-distribution resistance}. IM-FHS is conducted in a system with up to 256 nodes, and experimental results validate the efficiency of our approach. IM-FHS achieves higher throughput and smaller latency with faulty nodes than Stratus-FHS, the state-of-the-art protocol, and the throughput gain increases as the number of fault nodes. In a system with 100 nodes with 33 faulty nodes, IM-FHS achieves 9 times the throughput of Stratus-FHS while maintaining 1/10 the latency when dealing with maximum resilience against faulty nodes.

总结:

文章探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在现代社会中的应用与透明度问题。随着LLM的发展，用户被鼓励或要求公开其使用生成内容进行实际任务的情况。然而，发现了一种名为“秘密使用”的现象，即用户在不公开的情况下使用LLM。研究通过问卷调查和控制实验，收集了125个实际案例，并对300名参与者进行了实验，旨在深入理解秘密使用LLM的行为背景和原因。

研究发现，秘密使用行为往往由特定任务触发，不受用户年龄、性别等人口统计学特征的影响。任务类型影响着用户对秘密使用行为的意图，主要通过改变他们对外部对LLM使用的判断感知来实现。研究结果为未来设计促进更多透明披露LLM或其他AI技术使用的干预措施提供了重要见解。这一发现强调了在AI技术普及中确保透明度和责任的重要性，并提出了需要针对性策略以促进用户更负责任地使用这些工具。 <div>

Abstract: The advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have decentralized the responsibility for the transparency of AI usage. Specifically, LLM users are now encouraged or required to disclose the use of LLM-generated content for varied types of real-world tasks. However, an emerging phenomenon, users' secret use of LLM, raises challenges in ensuring end users adhere to the transparency requirement. Our study used mixed-methods with an exploratory survey (125 real-world secret use cases reported) and a controlled experiment among 300 users to investigate the contexts and causes behind the secret use of LLMs. We found that such secretive behavior is often triggered by certain tasks, transcending demographic and personality differences among users. Task types were found to affect users' intentions to use secretive behavior, primarily through influencing perceived external judgment regarding LLM usage. Our results yield important insights for future work on designing interventions to encourage more transparent disclosure of the use of LLMs or other AI technologies.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been demonstrated to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. As a decentralized machine learning framework, most research focuses on the Single-Label Backdoor Attack (SBA), where adversaries share the same target but neglect the fact that adversaries may be unaware of each other's existence and hold different targets, i.e., Multi-Label Backdoor Attack (MBA). Unfortunately, directly applying prior work to the MBA would not only be ineffective but also potentially mitigate each other. In this paper, we first investigate the limitations of applying previous work to the MBA. Subsequently, we propose M2M, a novel multi-label backdoor attack in federated learning (FL), which adversarially adapts the backdoor trigger to ensure that the backdoored sample is processed as clean target samples in the global model. Our key intuition is to establish a connection between the trigger pattern and the target class distribution, allowing different triggers to activate backdoors along clean activation paths of the target class without concerns about potential mitigation. Extensive evaluations comprehensively demonstrate that M2M outperforms various state-of-the-art attack methods. This work aims to alert researchers and developers to this potential threat and to inspire the design of effective detection methods. Our code will be made available later.

Abstract: This paper surveys innovative protocols that enhance the programming functionality of the Bitcoin blockchain, a key part of the "Bitcoin Ecosystem." Bitcoin utilizes the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model and a stack-based script language for efficient peer-to-peer payments, but it faces limitations in programming capability and throughput. The 2021 Taproot upgrade introduced the Schnorr signature algorithm and P2TR transaction type, significantly improving Bitcoin's privacy and programming capabilities. This upgrade has led to the development of protocols like Ordinals, Atomicals, and BitVM, which enhance Bitcoin's programming functionality and enrich its ecosystem. We explore the technical aspects of the Taproot upgrade and examine Bitcoin Layer 1 protocols that leverage Taproot's features to program non-fungible tokens (NFTs) into transactions, including Ordinals and Atomicals, along with the fungible token standards BRC-20 and ARC-20.
  Additionally, we categorize certain Bitcoin ecosystem protocols as Layer 2 solutions similar to Ethereum's, analyzing their impact on Bitcoin's performance. By analyzing data from the Bitcoin blockchain, we gather metrics on block capacity, miner fees, and the growth of Taproot transactions. Our findings confirm the positive effects of these protocols on Bitcoin's mainnet, bridging gaps in the literature regarding Bitcoin's programming capabilities and ecosystem protocols and providing valuable insights for practitioners and researchers.

Abstract: The Core Data Ontology (CDO) and the Informatics Domain Model represent a transformative approach to computational systems, shifting from traditional node-centric designs to a data-centric paradigm. This paper introduces a framework where data is categorized into four modalities: objects, events, concepts, and actions. This quadrimodal structure enhances data security, semantic interoperability, and scalability across distributed data ecosystems. The CDO offers a comprehensive ontology that supports AI development, role-based access control, and multimodal data management. By focusing on the intrinsic value of data, the Informatics Domain Model redefines system architectures to prioritize data security, provenance, and auditability, addressing vulnerabilities in current models. The paper outlines the methodology for developing the CDO, explores its practical applications in fields such as AI, robotics, and legal compliance, and discusses future directions for scalable, decentralized, and interoperable data ecosystems.

Abstract: The growing digitization of education presents significant challenges in maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of educational content. Traditional systems often fail to ensure data authenticity and prevent unauthorized alterations, particularly in the evaluation of teachers' professional activities, where demand for transparent and secure assessment mechanisms is increasing. In this context, Blockchain technology offers a novel solution to address these issues. This paper introduces a Blockchain-enhanced framework for the Electronic Platform for Expertise of Content (EPEC), a platform used for reviewing and assessing educational materials. Our approach integrates the Polygon network, a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, to securely store and retrieve encrypted reviews, ensuring both privacy and accountability. By leveraging Python, Flask, and Web3.py, we interact with a Solidity-based smart contract to securely link each review to a unique identifier (UID) that connects on-chain data with real-world databases. The system, containerized using Docker, facilitates easy deployment and integration through API endpoints. Our implementation demonstrates significant cost savings, with a 98\% reduction in gas fees compared to Ethereum, making it a scalable and cost-effective solution. This research contributes to the ongoing effort to implement Blockchain in educational content verification, offering a practical and secure framework that enhances trust and transparency in the digital education landscape.

本文探讨了在多机器人系统中解决无标签运动规划问题的方法，即在确保碰撞避免的前提下，将一组机器人分配至目标位置，以最小化总移动距离。该问题在探索、监控和运输等应用中扮演着关键角色。研究在分散式环境中进行，其中每个机器人仅知晓其最近的$k$个机器人与目标的位置信息，这一设置结合了组合分配与连续空间路径规划的特点，对传统的集中式方法提出了重大挑战。为解决这些挑战，提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的分散式策略。GNN使机器人能够决定与邻居交流的信息类型以及如何整合接收到的信息与本地观察结果以做出决策。通过模仿学习和专家政策（集中式匈牙利算法）进行训练，进一步使用强化学习优化策略以避免碰撞并提升性能。实验结果表明，该方法具有良好的可扩展性和有效性，所训练的GNN策略在100个机器人的情况下，可以扩展到最多500个机器人的情景，并在平均性能上优于现有最佳解决方案8.6%，远超简单的分散式贪心方法。这项工作为解决大规模多机器人协调问题提供了基础。 <div>

Abstract: Unlabeled motion planning involves assigning a set of robots to target locations while ensuring collision avoidance, aiming to minimize the total distance traveled. The problem forms an essential building block for multi-robot systems in applications such as exploration, surveillance, and transportation. We address this problem in a decentralized setting where each robot knows only the positions of its $k$-nearest robots and $k$-nearest targets. This scenario combines elements of combinatorial assignment and continuous-space motion planning, posing significant scalability challenges for traditional centralized approaches. To overcome these challenges, we propose a decentralized policy learned via a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The GNN enables robots to determine (1) what information to communicate to neighbors and (2) how to integrate received information with local observations for decision-making. We train the GNN using imitation learning with the centralized Hungarian algorithm as the expert policy, and further fine-tune it using reinforcement learning to avoid collisions and enhance performance. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. The GNN policy trained on 100 robots generalizes to scenarios with up to 500 robots, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions by 8.6\% on average and significantly surpassing greedy decentralized methods. This work lays the foundation for solving multi-robot coordination problems in settings where scalability is important.

<div> 关键词：RANDAO、操纵、以太坊、提案率、战略参与者

总结:

本文探讨了在以太坊网络中，如果攻击者控制了一定比例的代币，即“stake”，他们能够操纵RANDAO（随机性权威证明）机制的程度。RANDAO是用于生成区块头随机性的关键组件。文章提出了计算方法，以确定攻击者拥有不同比例stake时，能控制的轮次提案比例的最大值。这种方法考虑了攻击者对最后几个周期的提案者进行操纵的可能性。

具体来说，作者通过数学建模和分析，得出结论：

- 当该比例增加到10%，攻击者理论上可以控制约10.19%的提案。
- 对于20%的stake，理论上的控制比例提高至约20.68%。

Abstract: It is well-known that RANDAO manipulation is possible in Ethereum if an adversary controls the proposers assigned to the last slots in an epoch. We provide a methodology to compute, for any fraction $\alpha$ of stake owned by an adversary, the maximum fraction $f(\alpha)$ of rounds that a strategic adversary can propose. We further implement our methodology and compute $f(\cdot)$ for all $\alpha$. For example, we conclude that an optimal strategic participant with $5\%$ of the stake can propose a $5.048\%$ fraction of rounds, $10\%$ of the stake can propose a $10.19\%$ fraction of rounds, and $20\%$ of the stake can propose a $20.68\%$ fraction of rounds.

Abstract: Deep learning developments have improved medical imaging diagnoses dramatically, increasing accuracy in several domains. Nonetheless, obstacles continue to exist because of the requirement for huge datasets and legal limitations on data exchange. A solution is provided by Federated Learning (FL), which permits decentralized model training while maintaining data privacy. However, FL models are susceptible to data corruption, which may result in performance degradation. Using pre-trained models, this research suggests a strong FL framework to improve kidney stone diagnosis. Two different kidney stone datasets, each with six different categories of images, are used in our experimental setting. Our method involves two stages: Learning Parameter Optimization (LPO) and Federated Robustness Validation (FRV). We achieved a peak accuracy of 84.1% with seven epochs and 10 rounds during LPO stage, and 77.2% during FRV stage, showing enhanced diagnostic accuracy and robustness against image corruption. This highlights the potential of merging pre-trained models with FL to address privacy and performance concerns in medical diagnostics, and guarantees improved patient care and enhanced trust in FL-based medical systems.

Abstract: Storing big data directly on a blockchain poses a substantial burden due to the need to maintain a consistent ledger across all nodes. Numerous studies in decentralized storage systems have been conducted to tackle this particular challenge. Most state-of-the-art research concentrates on developing a general storage system that can accommodate diverse blockchain categories. However, it is essential to recognize the unique attributes of a consortium blockchain, such as data privacy and access control. Beyond ensuring high performance, these specific needs are often overlooked by general storage systems. This paper proposes a decentralized storage system for Hyperledger Fabric, which is a well-known consortium blockchain. First, we employ erasure coding to partition files, subsequently organizing these chunks into a hierarchical structure that fosters efficient and dependable data storage. Second, we design a two-layer hash-slots mechanism and a mirror strategy, enabling high data availability. Third, we design an access control mechanism based on a smart contract to regulate file access.

Abstract: Robot soccer, in its full complexity, poses an unsolved research challenge. Current solutions heavily rely on engineered heuristic strategies, which lack robustness and adaptability. Deep reinforcement learning has gained significant traction in various complex robotics tasks such as locomotion, manipulation, and competitive games (e.g., AlphaZero, OpenAI Five), making it a promising solution to the robot soccer problem. This paper introduces MARLadona. A decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) training pipeline capable of producing agents with sophisticated team play behavior, bridging the shortcomings of heuristic methods. Further, we created an open-source multi-agent soccer environment based on Isaac Gym. Utilizing our MARL framework and a modified a global entity encoder as our core architecture, our approach achieves a 66.8% win rate against HELIOS agent, which employs a state-of-the-art heuristic strategy. Furthermore, we provided an in-depth analysis of the policy behavior and interpreted the agent's intention using the critic network.

Abstract: For many users, a private key based wallet serves as the primary entry point to blockchains. Commonly recommended wallet authentication methods, such as mnemonics or hardware wallets, can be cumbersome. This difficulty in user onboarding has significantly hindered the adoption of blockchain-based applications.
  We develop zkLogin, a novel technique that leverages identity tokens issued by popular platforms (any OpenID Connect enabled platform e.g., Google, Facebook, etc.) to authenticate transactions. At the heart of zkLogin lies a signature scheme allowing the signer to sign using their existing OpenID accounts and nothing else. This improves the user experience significantly as users do not need to remember a new secret and can reuse their existing accounts.
  zkLogin provides strong security and privacy guarantees. Unlike prior works, zkLogin's security relies solely on the underlying platform's authentication mechanism without the need for any additional trusted parties (e.g., trusted hardware or oracles). As the name suggests, zkLogin leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to ensure that the sensitive link between a user's off-chain and on-chain identities is hidden, even from the platform itself.
  zkLogin enables a number of important applications outside blockchains. It allows billions of users to produce \textit{verifiable digital content leveraging their existing digital identities}, e.g., email address. For example, a journalist can use zkLogin to sign a news article with their email address, allowing verification of the article's authorship by any party.
  We have implemented and deployed zkLogin on the Sui blockchain as an additional alternative to traditional digital signature-based addresses.

Abstract: The acquisition of training data is crucial for machine learning applications. Data markets can increase the supply of data, particularly in data-scarce domains such as healthcare, by incentivizing potential data providers to join the market. A major challenge for a data buyer in such a market is choosing the most valuable data points from a data seller. Unlike prior work in data valuation, which assumes centralized data access, we propose a federated approach to the data acquisition problem that is inspired by linear experimental design. Our proposed data acquisition method achieves lower prediction error without requiring labeled validation data and can be optimized in a fast and federated procedure. The key insight of our work is that a method that directly estimates the benefit of acquiring data for test set prediction is particularly compatible with a decentralized market setting.

Abstract: This paper explores the distributed broadcast problem within the context of network communications, a critical challenge in decentralized information dissemination. We put forth a novel hypergraph-based approach to address this issue, focusing on minimizing the number of broadcasts to ensure comprehensive data sharing among all network users.

<div> 关键词：智能合约、UTXO模型、效率瓶颈、分布式状态、并行化验证

总结:

文章探讨了基于UTXO模型的智能合约平台所面临的效率问题，即任何发送给合约的交易都必须指定整个更新后的合约状态。这种需求在许多应用场景中变得尤为棘手，尤其是当合约状态包含动态数据结构时，用于追踪用户与合约之间的交互。问题主要体现在两个方面：一方面，交易中的大状态意味着高昂的交易费用；另一方面，大集中式状态阻碍了交易的并行化，这是UTXO区块链相对于账户型区块链的一大优势。

为了解决这个问题，文章提出了一种技术，允许在扩展的UTXO区块链上执行智能合约，使得合约状态可以分布在多个UTXO中。这样一来，交易只需要指定需要访问的部分状态，从而减少了交易大小（和费用）。作者展示了如何利用此模型在多核CPU上并行化交易验证过程，并实施了该技术，提供了其有效性的实证验证。通过这种方式，不仅降低了交易成本，还提高了系统性能和可扩展性。 <div>

Abstract: Smart contract platforms based on the UTXO model face an efficiency bottleneck, in that any transaction sent to a contract must specify the entire updated contract state. This requirement becomes particularly burdensome when the contract state contains dynamic data structures, as needed in many use cases to track interactions between users and the contract. The problem is twofold: on the one hand, a large state in transactions implies a large transaction fee; on the other hand, a large centralized state is detrimental to the parallelization of transactions -- a feature that is often cited as a key advantage of UTXO-based blockchains over account-based ones. We propose a technique to efficiently execute smart contracts on an extended UTXO blockchain, which allows the contract state to be distributed across multiple UTXOs. In this way, transactions only need to specify the part of the state they need to access, reducing their size (and fees). We show how to exploit our model to parallelize the validation of transactions on multi-core CPUs. We implement our technique and provide an empirical validation of its effectiveness.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider solving the distributed optimization problem over a multi-agent network under the communication restricted setting. We study a compressed decentralized stochastic gradient method, termed ``compressed exact diffusion with adaptive stepsizes (CEDAS)", and show the method asymptotically achieves comparable convergence rate as centralized { stochastic gradient descent (SGD)} for both smooth strongly convex objective functions and smooth nonconvex objective functions under unbiased compression operators. In particular, to our knowledge, CEDAS enjoys so far the shortest transient time (with respect to the graph specifics) for achieving the convergence rate of centralized SGD, which behaves as $\mathcal{O}(n{C^3}/(1-\lambda_2)^{2})$ under smooth strongly convex objective functions, and $\mathcal{O}(n^3{C^6}/(1-\lambda_2)^4)$ under smooth nonconvex objective functions, where $(1-\lambda_2)$ denotes the spectral gap of the mixing matrix, and $C>0$ is the compression-related parameter. In particular, CEDAS exhibits the shortest transient times when $C < \mathcal{O}(1/(1 - \lambda_2)^2)$, which is common in practice. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital assets, the imperative for robust data privacy and compliance with regulatory frameworks has intensified. This paper investigates the critical role of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the management of digital assets and introduces innovative unlearning techniques specifically tailored to GNN architectures. We categorize unlearning strategies into two primary classes: data-driven approximation, which manipulates the graph structure to isolate and remove the influence of specific nodes, and model-driven approximation, which modifies the internal parameters and architecture of the GNN itself. By examining recent advancements in these unlearning methodologies, we highlight their applicability in various use cases, including fraud detection, risk assessment, token relationship prediction, and decentralized governance. We discuss the challenges inherent in balancing model performance with the requirements for data unlearning, particularly in the context of real-time financial applications. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both unlearning strategies to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of GNNs in digital asset ecosystems. Ultimately, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and implementing GNN unlearning techniques, paving the way for secure and compliant deployment of machine learning in the digital asset domain.

<div> 关键词：SmartReco、Read-Only Reentrancy、DApps、智能合约、漏洞检测

总结:
本文提出了一种名为SmartReco的新框架，用于检测去中心化应用（DApps）中的读取只读重入（ROR）漏洞。SmartReco结合了静态分析和动态分析（即模糊测试）来检测智能合约中的漏洞。其核心设计包括：识别不同DApps之间的边界；对关键点进行精细静态分析；利用链上交易数据跨多个DApps执行多函数模糊测试验证ROR的存在。通过评估包含45个ROR的手动标记数据集，SmartReco实现了88.63%的精确度和86.36%的召回率。此外，SmartReco成功检测到123个流行DApps中的43个新ROR，受影响的资产总额约为52万美元。这表明SmartReco在提高DApps安全性方面具有显著潜力，能够有效识别和检测导致重大经济损失的新型漏洞。 <div>

Abstract: Despite the increasing popularity of Decentralized Applications (DApps), they are suffering from various vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries for profits. Among such vulnerabilities, Read-Only Reentrancy (called ROR in this paper), is an emerging type of vulnerability that arises from the complex interactions between DApps. In the recent three years, attack incidents of ROR have already caused around 30M USD losses to the DApp ecosystem. Existing techniques for vulnerability detection in smart contracts can hardly detect Read-Only Reentrancy attacks, due to the lack of tracking and analyzing the complex interactions between multiple DApps. In this paper, we propose SmartReco, a new framework for detecting Read-Only Reentrancy vulnerability in DApps through a novel combination of static and dynamic analysis (i.e., fuzzing) over smart contracts. The key design behind SmartReco is threefold: (1) SmartReco identifies the boundary between different DApps from the heavy-coupled cross-contract interactions. (2) SmartReco performs fine-grained static analysis to locate points of interest (i.e., entry functions) that may lead to ROR. (3) SmartReco utilizes the on-chain transaction data and performs multi-function fuzzing (i.e., the entry function and victim function) across different DApps to verify the existence of ROR. Our evaluation of a manual-labeled dataset with 45 RORs shows that SmartReco achieves a precision of 88.63% and a recall of 86.36%. In addition, SmartReco successfully detects 43 new RORs from 123 popular DApps. The total assets affected by such RORs reach around 520,000 USD.

<div> 关键词：GAIL、NTN、RL、IRL、Federated Learning

<br />
总结:

本文提出了一种基于生成对抗式模仿学习（GAIL）的新型策略学习方法，用于优化非地面网络（NTN）中的波束形成、频谱分配和远程用户设备（RUE）关联。该方法通过集成逆强化学习（IRL）与异步联邦学习，旨在最大化频谱效率（SE），同时满足RUE的最小信息速率要求。为了解决该问题的非凸性与NP-hard性质，引入了多对一匹配理论结合多代理异步联邦IRL（MA-AFIRL）框架。这种方法允许代理通过异步环境交互学习，提高了训练效率和可扩展性。

为了生成专家策略，使用鲸鱼优化算法（WOA）进行训练，以此作为GAIL框架中自动奖励函数的训练数据。实验结果表明，提出的MA-AFIRL方法在收敛速度和奖励值上相较于传统强化学习方法有14.6%的提升，这标志着6G NTN优化领域的一个新的基准。

本文的贡献在于提出了一种自动化、高效、可扩展的NTN优化策略学习方法，通过GAIL和联邦学习技术克服了传统RL方法的局限性，显著提高了网络性能并降低了人工设计奖励函数的复杂度。 <div>

Abstract: In this paper, a novel generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL)-powered policy learning approach is proposed for optimizing beamforming, spectrum allocation, and remote user equipment (RUE) association in NTNs. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods for wireless network optimization often rely on manually designed reward functions, which can require extensive parameter tuning. To overcome these limitations, we employ inverse RL (IRL), specifically leveraging the GAIL framework, to automatically learn reward functions without manual design. We augment this framework with an asynchronous federated learning approach, enabling decentralized multi-satellite systems to collaboratively derive optimal policies. The proposed method aims to maximize spectrum efficiency (SE) while meeting minimum information rate requirements for RUEs. To address the non-convex, NP-hard nature of this problem, we combine the many-to-one matching theory with a multi-agent asynchronous federated IRL (MA-AFIRL) framework. This allows agents to learn through asynchronous environmental interactions, improving training efficiency and scalability. The expert policy is generated using the Whale optimization algorithm (WOA), providing data to train the automatic reward function within GAIL. Simulation results show that the proposed MA-AFIRL method outperforms traditional RL approaches, achieving a $14.6\%$ improvement in convergence and reward value. The novel GAIL-driven policy learning establishes a novel benchmark for 6G NTN optimization.

Abstract: We address the challenge of safe control in decentralized multi-agent robotic settings, where agents use uncertain black-box models to predict other agents' trajectories. We use the recently proposed conformal decision theory to adapt the restrictiveness of control barrier functions-based safety constraints based on observed prediction errors. We use these constraints to synthesize controllers that balance between the objectives of safety and task accomplishment, despite the prediction errors. We provide an upper bound on the average over time of the value of a monotonic function of the difference between the safety constraint based on the predicted trajectories and the constraint based on the ground truth ones. We validate our theory through experimental results showing the performance of our controllers when navigating a robot in the multi-agent scenes in the Stanford Drone Dataset.

<div> 关键词：XDPoS共识机制、XDC网络、低能耗、高效交易、无gas费

总结:

本文主要介绍了XDC网络，一个专注于企业应用的区块链平台。它结合了公共和私有区块链的优势，提供快速交易时间、低能耗和经济的气体费用。XDC设计用于互操作性，支持去中心化应用程序(dApps)，并能平滑地与金融系统集成。特别适合贸易融资和实物资产代币化，由于其强调安全性和可扩展性。

然而，文章指出了一些限制因素，阻碍了某些高频应用的广泛接受和使用。为解决这一问题，提出了一种创新的去中心化应用(dApp)，旨在创建一个无需gas费的子网。用户可以在主网上质押XDC，生成一个类似于非加密网络的子网，接受XDC网络上的货币费用。这使得质押过程更有效率、成本效益更高，并同时增强可扩展性。性能评估显示，在吞吐量、延迟、可扩展性、安全性和成本效率方面都有出色的结果。此外，文章讨论了此方法的应用案例、挑战以及应对策略。 <div>

Abstract: With a delegated proof-of-stake (XDPoS) consensus mechanism, the XDC Network is an enterprise-focused blockchain platform that combines the strength of public and private blockchains to provide quick transaction times, low energy consumption, and economical gas fees. XDC is designed for interoperability and supports decentralized apps (dApps) and integrates smoothly with financial systems. It is perfect for trade financing and tokenisation of physical assets because of its emphasis on security and scalability. However, there are a few critical issues that hamper wider acceptance and usability for certain high-frequency applications. This whitepaper introduces a novel and enthralling dApp for establishing a gasless subnet in which mainnet XDC can be staked to spin off a subnet that functions similarly to a non-crypto network, accepting currency fees on the XDC network. This would allow users to stake their tokens without incurring gas fees making the staking process more efficient, cost-effective, and simultaneously enhancing scalability. Performance evaluation of the dApp shows promising results in terms of throughput, latency, scalability, security, and cost efficiency. The use cases and applications of this approach along with challenges and ensuing solutions are included.

Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) network can address the issue of limited computing resources and data processing capabilities of individual vehicles, but it also brings the risk of privacy leakage to vehicle users. Applying blockchain technology can establish secure data links within the IoV, solving the problems of insufficient computing resources for each vehicle and the security of data transmission over the network. However, with the development of the IoV, the amount of data interaction between multiple vehicles and between vehicles and base stations, roadside units, etc., is continuously increasing. There is a need to further reduce the interaction volume, and intelligent data compression is key to solving this problem. The VIB technique facilitates the training of encoding and decoding models, substantially diminishing the volume of data that needs to be transmitted. This paper introduces an innovative approach that integrates blockchain with VIB, referred to as BVIB, designed to lighten computational workloads and reinforce the security of the network. We first construct a new network framework by separating the encoding and decoding networks to address the computational burden issue, and then propose a new algorithm to enhance the security of IoV networks. We also discuss the impact of the data extraction rate on system latency to determine the most suitable data extraction rate. An experimental framework combining Python and C++ has been established to substantiate the efficacy of our BVIB approach. Comprehensive simulation studies indicate that the BVIB consistently excels in comparison to alternative foundational methodologies.

<div> 关键词：多旋翼系统、分散式控制、安全保证、动作约束、感知范围限制

总结:

本文主要探讨了多旋翼系统在分散式控制下的挑战，特别是安全性和协调性，当面临传感和通信限制时。当前的方法通常依赖于控制障碍函数（CBFs）来提供安全性保障，但往往忽视了动作约束和有限的检测范围。为解决这一问题，研究团队提出了一种新的分散式非线性模型预测控制（NMPC），该方法整合了指数CBF（ECBFs），以增强多旋翼系统的安全性和优化性能。

通过设置保守和实用的最小范围界限，以保持ECBFs的安全性，研究者确保了系统在实际应用中的可靠性。他们进行了大量模拟实验，涉及多达10个旋翼体和20个障碍物，并通过现实世界的实验验证了3个旋翼体的可行性。结果表明，所提出的方法在真实场景中表现良好，显示出其在可靠多旋翼团队操作中的潜力。

Abstract: Multi-quadrotor systems face significant challenges in decentralized control, particularly with safety and coordination under sensing and communication limitations. State-of-the-art methods leverage Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to provide safety guarantees but often neglect actuation constraints and limited detection range. To address these gaps, we propose a novel decentralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) that integrates Exponential CBFs (ECBFs) to enhance safety and optimality in multi-quadrotor systems. We provide both conservative and practical minimum bounds of the range that preserve the safety guarantees of the ECBFs. We validate our approach through extensive simulations with up to 10 quadrotors and 20 obstacles, as well as real-world experiments with 3 quadrotors. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in realistic settings, highlighting its potential for reliable quadrotor teams operations.

<div> 关键词：Federated Learning、Semi-decentralized FL、Gradient Tracking、Convergence、Efficiency

<br /><br />
总结:
本文主要探讨了在雾网络环境下，传统星型拓扑架构的联邦学习(Federated Learning, FL)所面临的可扩展性问题。针对基于设备到设备(D2D)通信的网络，提出了一种称为半去中心化联邦学习(Semi-decentralized Federated Learning, SD-FL)的方法。SD-FL将模型协作分为两个阶段：下层利用D2D通信在子网络内进行局部模型聚合，上层则负责设备到服务器(DEVICE-SERVER, DS)通信以实现全局模型聚合。然而，现有的SD-FL方案依赖于梯度多样性假设，当数据分布更加不均匀时，这些假设会成为性能瓶颈。

为了解决这一问题，作者提出了半去中心化梯度跟踪(Semi-decentralized Gradient Tracking, SD-GT)，这是第一个无需梯度多样性假设的SD-FL方法。通过在每个通信层中引入跟踪项，SD-GT能够改进模型训练质量和通信成本。作者对SD-GT进行了理论分析，给出了非凸、凸和强凸问题中的收敛性上界，并展示了如何通过调整子网采样率和D2D轮数来优化性能与效率之间的权衡。数值评估显示，与SD-FL和其他梯度跟踪基线相比，SD-GT在多个数据集上均表现出显著的改进。

通过上述研究，SD-GT提供了一种有效解决雾网络环境下联邦学习可扩展性问题的新方法，同时改善了模型性能并降低了通信成本。 <div>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) encounters scalability challenges when implemented over fog networks that do not follow FL's conventional star topology architecture. Semi-decentralized FL (SD-FL) has proposed a solution for device-to-device (D2D) enabled networks that divides model cooperation into two stages: at the lower stage, D2D communications is employed for local model aggregations within subnetworks (subnets), while the upper stage handles device-server (DS) communications for global model aggregations. However, existing SD-FL schemes are based on gradient diversity assumptions that become performance bottlenecks as data distributions become more heterogeneous. In this work, we develop semi-decentralized gradient tracking (SD-GT), the first SD-FL methodology that removes the need for such assumptions by incorporating tracking terms into device updates for each communication layer. Our analytical characterization of SD-GT reveals upper bounds on convergence for non-convex, convex, and strongly-convex problems. We show how the bounds enable the development of an optimization algorithm that navigates the performance-efficiency trade-off by tuning subnet sampling rate and D2D rounds for each global training interval. Our subsequent numerical evaluations demonstrate that SD-GT obtains substantial improvements in trained model quality and communication cost relative to baselines in SD-FL and gradient tracking on several datasets.

Abstract: Distributed learning is essential to train machine learning algorithms across heterogeneous agents while maintaining data privacy. We conduct an asymptotic analysis of Unified Distributed SGD (UD-SGD), exploring a variety of communication patterns, including decentralized SGD and local SGD within Federated Learning (FL), as well as the increasing communication interval in the FL setting. In this study, we assess how different sampling strategies, such as i.i.d. sampling, shuffling, and Markovian sampling, affect the convergence speed of UD-SGD by considering the impact of agent dynamics on the limiting covariance matrix as described in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). Our findings not only support existing theories on linear speedup and asymptotic network independence, but also theoretically and empirically show how efficient sampling strategies employed by individual agents contribute to overall convergence in UD-SGD. Simulations reveal that a few agents using highly efficient sampling can achieve or surpass the performance of the majority employing moderately improved strategies, providing new insights beyond traditional analyses focusing on the worst-performing agent.

Abstract: Digital identity plays a vital role in enabling secure access to resources and services in the digital world. Traditional identity authentication methods, such as password-based and biometric authentications, have limitations in terms of security, privacy, and scalability. Decentralized authentication approaches leveraging blockchain technology have emerged as a promising solution. However, existing decentralized authentication methods often rely on indirect identity verification (e.g. using passwords or digital signatures as authentication credentials) and face challenges such as Sybil attacks. In this paper, we propose BioZero, an efficient and privacy-preserving decentralized biometric authentication protocol that can be implemented on open blockchain. BioZero leverages Pedersen commitment and homomorphic computation to protect user biometric privacy while enabling efficient verification. We enhance the protocol with non-interactive homomorphic computation and employ zero-knowledge proofs for secure on-chain verification. The unique aspect of BioZero is that it is fully decentralized and can be executed by blockchain smart contracts in a very efficient way. We analyze the security of BioZero and validate its performance through a prototype implementation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and security of BioZero in decentralized authentication scenarios. Our work contributes to the advancement of decentralized identity authentication using biometrics.

总结:
本文探讨了随着工业4.0和工业物联网的发展，工业控制系统如何采用IT解决方案，特别是通信标准和协议。文章强调了在系统变得更加分散和互联时，增强安全措施的需求日益迫切。传统的威胁建模方法往往依赖于结构化的头脑风暴会议，由领域专家和安全专家参与，但这种方法经常未能提供全面的资产和接口识别，导致威胁建模不足，进而影响到安全架构的构建。

为了验证所提方法的有效性，作者对一组12名安全专家进行了研究，展示了方法应用于可编程逻辑控制器（PLC）的结果。研究不仅展示了方法的应用实例，还提供了专家们对威胁建模的一般观点和工作流程的宝贵见解。这些发现对于理解当前威胁建模实践以及改进方法论具有重要意义。 <div>

Abstract: As Industry 4.0 and the Industrial Internet of Things continue to advance, industrial control systems are increasingly adopting IT solutions, including communication standards and protocols. As these systems become more decentralized and interconnected, a critical need for enhanced security measures arises. Threat modeling is traditionally performed in structured brainstorming sessions involving domain and security experts. Such sessions, however, often fail to provide an exhaustive identification of assets and interfaces due to the lack of a systematic approach. This is a major issue, as it leads to poor threat modeling, resulting in insufficient mitigation strategies and, lastly, a flawed security architecture.
  We propose a method for the analysis of assets in industrial systems, with special focus on physical threats. Inspired by the ISO/OSI reference model, a systematic approach is introduced to help identify and classify asset interfaces. This results in an enriched system model of the asset, offering a comprehensive overview visually represented as an interface tree, thereby laying the foundation for subsequent threat modeling steps. To demonstrate the proposed method, the results of its application to a programmable logic controller (PLC) are presented. In support of this, a study involving a group of 12 security experts was conducted. Additionally, the study offers valuable insights into the experts' general perspectives and workflows on threat modeling.

<br />
<br />总结:

本文探讨了随机化容错共识协议在云计算和区块链平台中的广泛应用。这些协议的关键在于确保其正确性，因此需要一种形式化的模型进行验证。文章提出了一种扩展，将概率阈值自动机（PTA）应用于验证具有公共硬币的随机化容错共识协议。这与传统的PTA不同，后者仅适用于具有本地硬币的协议。

首先，作者引入了一个过程来模拟公共硬币（即“公共硬币过程”），以克服由于添加此过程而引发的对称性的破坏和技术挑战。通过一系列创新方法，他们证明了如何适应PTA以克服这些挑战。

接着，应用这一新方法验证了8个具有公共硬币的随机化共识协议的三个关键属性：一致性、有效性以及几乎必然终止。这表明该扩展的PTA模型不仅能够处理具有公共硬币的协议，而且能够有效地验证其核心特性，为确保此类协议的可靠性提供了坚实基础。 <div>

Abstract: Randomized fault-tolerant consensus protocols with common coins are widely used in cloud computing and blockchain platforms. Due to their fundamental role, it is vital to guarantee their correctness. Threshold automata is a formal model designed for the verification of fault-tolerant consensus protocols. It has recently been extended to probabilistic threshold automata (PTAs) to verify randomized fault-tolerant consensus protocols. Nevertheless, PTA can only model randomized consensus protocols with local coins.
  In this work, we extend PTA to verify randomized fault-tolerant consensus protocols with common coins. Our main idea is to add a process to simulate the common coin (the so-called common-coin process). Although the addition of the common-coin process destroys the symmetry and poses technical challenges, we show how PTA can be adapted to overcome the challenges. We apply our approach to verify the agreement, validity and almost-sure termination properties of 8 randomized consensus protocols with common coins.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a distributed machine learning approach that addresses privacy concerns by training AI models locally on devices. Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) extends the FL paradigm by eliminating the central server, thereby enhancing scalability and robustness through the avoidance of a single point of failure. However, DFL faces significant challenges in optimizing security, as most Byzantine-robust algorithms proposed in the literature are designed for centralized scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel Byzantine-robust aggregation algorithm to enhance the security of Decentralized Federated Learning environments, coined WFAgg. This proposal handles the adverse conditions and strength robustness of dynamic decentralized topologies at the same time by employing multiple filters to identify and mitigate Byzantine attacks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in maintaining model accuracy and convergence in the presence of various Byzantine attack scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art centralized Byzantine-robust aggregation schemes (such as Multi-Krum or Clustering). These algorithms are evaluated on an IID image classification problem in both centralized and decentralized scenarios.

Abstract: Aerial swarm systems possess immense potential in various aspects, such as cooperative exploration, target tracking, search and rescue. Efficient, accurate self and mutual state estimation are the critical preconditions for completing these swarm tasks, which remain challenging research topics. This paper proposes Swarm-LIO2: a fully decentralized, plug-and-play, computationally efficient, and bandwidth-efficient LiDAR-inertial odometry for aerial swarm systems. Swarm-LIO2 uses a decentralized, plug-and-play network as the communication infrastructure. Only bandwidth-efficient and low-dimensional information is exchanged, including identity, ego-state, mutual observation measurements, and global extrinsic transformations. To support the plug-and-play of new teammate participants, Swarm-LIO2 detects potential teammate UAVs and initializes the temporal offset and global extrinsic transformation all automatically. To enhance the initialization efficiency, novel reflectivity-based UAV detection, trajectory matching, and factor graph optimization methods are proposed. For state estimation, Swarm-LIO2 fuses LiDAR, IMU, and mutual observation measurements within an efficient ESIKF framework, with careful compensation of temporal delay and modeling of measurements to enhance the accuracy and consistency.

Abstract: Semantic communications (SC) is an emerging communication paradigm in which wireless devices can send only relevant information from a source of data while relying on computing resources to regenerate missing data points. However, the design of a multi-user SC system becomes more challenging because of the computing and communication overhead required for coordination. Existing solutions for learning the semantic language and performing resource allocation often fail to capture the computing and communication tradeoffs involved in multiuser SC. To address this gap, a novel framework for decentralized computing and communication resource allocation in multiuser SC systems is proposed. The challenge of efficiently allocating communication and computing resources (for reasoning) in a decentralized manner to maximize the quality of task experience for the end users is addressed through the application of Stackelberg hyper game theory. Leveraging the concept of second-level hyper games, novel analytical formulations are developed to model misperceptions of the users about each other's communication and control strategies. Further, equilibrium analysis of the learned resource allocation protocols examines the convergence of the computing and communication strategies to a local Stackelberg equilibria, considering misperceptions. Simulation results show that the proposed Stackelberg hyper game results in efficient usage of communication and computing resources while maintaining a high quality of experience for the users compared to state-of-the-art that does not account for the misperceptions.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of agent-to-agent interaction in decentralized (federated) learning over time-varying directed graphs, and, in doing so, propose a consensus-based algorithm called DSGTm-TV. The proposed algorithm incorporates gradient tracking and heavy-ball momentum to distributively optimize a global objective function, while preserving local data privacy. Under DSGTm-TV, agents will update local model parameters and gradient estimates using information exchange with neighboring agents enabled through row- and column-stochastic mixing matrices, which we show guarantee both consensus and optimality. Our analysis establishes that DSGTm-TV exhibits linear convergence to the exact global optimum when exact gradient information is available, and converges in expectation to a neighborhood of the global optimum when employing stochastic gradients. Moreover, in contrast to existing methods, DSGTm-TV preserves convergence for networks with uncoordinated stepsizes and momentum parameters, for which we provide explicit bounds. These results enable agents to operate in a fully decentralized manner, independently optimizing their local hyper-parameters. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach via comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines on real-world image classification and natural language processing tasks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm where models are trained on distributed devices and are aggregated at a central server. Existing FL frameworks assume simple two-tier network topologies where end devices are directly connected to the aggregation server. While this is a practical mental model, it does not exploit the inherent topology of real-world distributed systems like the Internet-of-Things. We present Flight, a novel FL framework that supports complex hierarchical multi-tier topologies, asynchronous aggregation, and decouples the control plane from the data plane. We compare the performance of Flight against Flower, a state-of-the-art FL framework. Our results show that Flight scales beyond Flower, supporting up to 2048 simultaneous devices, and reduces FL makespan across several models. Finally, we show that Flight's hierarchical FL model can reduce communication overheads by more than 60%.

Abstract: Recent innovations in autonomous drones have facilitated time-optimal flight in single-drone configurations and enhanced maneuverability in multi-drone systems through the application of optimal control and learning-based methods. However, few studies have achieved time-optimal motion planning for multi-drone systems, particularly during highly agile maneuvers or in dynamic scenarios. This paper presents a decentralized policy network for time-optimal multi-drone flight using multi-agent reinforcement learning. To strike a balance between flight efficiency and collision avoidance, we introduce a soft collision penalty inspired by optimization-based methods. By customizing PPO in a centralized training, decentralized execution (CTDE) fashion, we unlock higher efficiency and stability in training, while ensuring lightweight implementation. Extensive simulations show that, despite slight performance trade-offs compared to single-drone systems, our multi-drone approach maintains near-time-optimal performance with low collision rates. Real-world experiments validate our method, with two quadrotors using the same network as simulation achieving a maximum speed of 13.65 m/s and a maximum body rate of 13.4 rad/s in a 5.5 m * 5.5 m * 2.0 m space across various tracks, relying entirely on onboard computation.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are being employed in several mapping and data collection tasks due to their efficiency and low labor costs. In these tasks, the robots are required to map targets-of-interest in an unknown environment while constrained to a given resource budget such as path length or mission time. This is a challenging problem as each robot has to not only detect and avoid collisions from static obstacles in the environment but also has to model other robots' trajectories to avoid inter-robot collisions. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach for multi-robot informative path planning to map targets-of-interest in an unknown 3D environment. A key aspect of our approach is an augmented graph that models other robots' trajectories to enable planning for communication and inter-robot collision avoidance. We train our decentralized reinforcement learning policy via the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. Once trained, our policy is also scalable to varying number of robots and does not require re-training. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-robot target mapping approaches by 33.75% in terms of the number of discovered targets-of-interest.

总结:
文章探讨了在部分去中心化的无线网络中，特别是由多个移动发射器（TXs）和基站（BSs）构成的网络环境下，如何有效利用多环境混合Q学习（MEMQ）算法进行策略优化。主要关注于解决大型状态空间带来的挑战，通过将多个Q学习算法集成在相关环境（所谓的“数字表亲”）中来提高性能并降低复杂性。然而，传统的MEMQ设计局限于单一集中式代理网络，不适用于分散或多代理网络。

为解决这一问题，研究提出了一种新型的多代理MEMQ算法，专门针对部分去中心化无线网络。在这个算法中，独立的TXs在非协调状态下各自行动以最小化个体成本，而在协调状态下，TXs使用贝叶斯方法根据本地观察结果估计联合状态，并与领导TX共享有限信息以最小化联合成本。这种信息共享的成本线性增长，与联合状态-动作空间的大小无关。

该算法的实施显著提高了效率，相比集中式MEMQ，平均策略误差（APE）增加了20%，但比几种先进的分散式Q学习算法快了25%，同时APE减少了40%。此外，算法的收敛性也得到了验证。通过对比实验，证明了该算法在处理部分去中心化无线网络中的高效性和实用性。 <div>

Abstract: Q-learning is a powerful tool for network control and policy optimization in wireless networks, but it struggles with large state spaces. Recent advancements, like multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ), improves performance and reduces complexity by integrating multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple related environments so-called digital cousins. However, MEMQ is designed for centralized single-agent networks and is not suitable for decentralized or multi-agent networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ algorithm for partially decentralized wireless networks with multiple mobile transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs), where TXs do not have access to each other's states and actions. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state based on local observations and share limited information with leader TX to minimize joint cost. The cost of information sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. The proposed scheme is 50% faster than centralized MEMQ with only a 20% increase in average policy error (APE) and is 25% faster than several advanced decentralized Q-learning algorithms with 40% less APE. The convergence of the algorithm is also demonstrated.

总结:

本文提出了一种名为“物理增强残差策略学习”（PERPL）的框架，旨在结合物理基础模型和强化学习的优点。物理基础模型提供高效的数据处理能力和可解释性，而强化学习则具备适应多目标场景和快速计算的能力。PERPL框架通过引入物理组件来提升模型的可解释性和稳定性，同时利用学习到的残差策略对物理模型进行调整以适应环境变化，从而优化决策过程。

该研究将PERPL应用于分散式控制的混合交通队列管理中，包括连接和自动化车辆（CAVs）与传统驾驶车辆（HVs）。使用恒定时间间隔（CTG）策略进行巡航，并考虑了执行器和通信延迟的影响。实验结果表明，相较于传统的线性模型和单独的强化学习方法，在极端条件和真实前车轨迹下，PERPL方法能够实现更小的车距误差和更好的振荡衰减效果。

此外，从宏观角度来看，随着采用PERPL方案的CAVs渗透率增加，整体交通振荡也得到了有效降低。这表明PERPL不仅在微观层面改善了车辆控制性能，也在宏观层面优化了交通流，展现了其在复杂动态环境下显著的应用潜力。 <div>

Abstract: Linear control models have gained extensive application in vehicle control due to their simplicity, ease of use, and support for stability analysis. However, these models lack adaptability to the changing environment and multi-objective settings. Reinforcement learning (RL) models, on the other hand, offer adaptability but suffer from a lack of interpretability and generalization capabilities. This paper aims to develop a family of RL-based controllers enhanced by physics-informed policies, leveraging the advantages of both physics-based models (data-efficient and interpretable) and RL methods (flexible to multiple objectives and fast computing). We propose the Physics-Enhanced Residual Policy Learning (PERPL) framework, where the physics component provides model interpretability and stability. The learning-based Residual Policy adjusts the physics-based policy to adapt to the changing environment, thereby refining the decisions of the physics model. We apply our proposed model to decentralized control to mixed traffic platoon of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) using a constant time gap (CTG) strategy for cruising and incorporating actuator and communication delays. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves smaller headway errors and better oscillation dampening than linear models and RL alone in scenarios with artificially extreme conditions and real preceding vehicle trajectories. At the macroscopic level, overall traffic oscillations are also reduced as the penetration rate of CAVs employing the PERPL scheme increases.

This paper details experiments conducted at MigaLabs to enhance Blockprint's accuracy, evaluating various configurations for the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier and exploring the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier as a proposed alternative. Findings suggest that the MLP classifier generally achieves superior accuracy with a smaller training dataset. The study revealed that clients running in different modes, especially those subscribed to all subnets, impact attestation inclusion differently, leading to proposed methods for mitigating the decline in model accuracy. Consequently, the recommendation is to employ an MLP model trained with a combined dataset of slots from both default and subscribed-to-all-subnets client configurations.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with robotics has significantly advanced robots' abilities in perception, cognition, and task planning. The use of natural language interfaces offers a unified approach for expressing the capability differences of heterogeneous robots, facilitating communication between them, and enabling seamless task allocation and collaboration. Currently, the utilization of LLMs to achieve decentralized multi-heterogeneous robot collaborative tasks remains an under-explored area of research. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that utilizes LLMs to achieve decentralized collaboration among multiple heterogeneous robots. Our framework supports three robot categories, mobile robots, manipulation robots, and mobile manipulation robots, working together to complete tasks such as exploration, transportation, and organization. We developed a rich set of textual feedback mechanisms and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts to enhance task planning efficiency and overall system performance. The mobile manipulation robot can adjust its base position flexibly, ensuring optimal conditions for grasping tasks. The manipulation robot can comprehend task requirements, seek assistance when necessary, and handle objects appropriately. Meanwhile, the mobile robot can explore the environment extensively, map object locations, and communicate this information to the mobile manipulation robot, thus improving task execution efficiency. We evaluated the framework using PyBullet, creating scenarios with three different room layouts and three distinct operational tasks. We tested various LLM models and conducted ablation studies to assess the contributions of different modules. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness and necessity of our proposed framework.

<div> 关键词：大型语言模型（LLMs）、社会偏见、多LLM方法、集中式方法、分布式方法

总结:
本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的社会偏见问题及其解决策略。随着LLMs在社会各领域的广泛应用，它们所展现出来的偏见问题引起了广泛关注。文章首先指出，尽管通过数据增强、零样本提示和模型微调等技术在一定程度上缓解了偏见，但仍有持续存在的偏见，包括可能难以察觉的微妙偏见。为了进一步改进这一状况，作者提出了一个创新的多LLM去偏见框架，旨在减少LLMs中的偏见。

该框架包括两种不同的方法：集中式方法和分布式方法。在集中式方法中，对话由单一中心LLM协调；而在分布式方法中，所有模型直接通信。研究结果表明，多LLM框架在多个社会群体中显著降低了偏见，其性能超越了基线方法。这一发现为LLMs的公平性和可靠性提供了新的途径，有助于促进更广泛的社会应用。

通过引入多LLM方法，本文不仅展示了如何有效减少LLMs中的偏见，还强调了在设计和应用这些技术时需要考虑的社会责任。这一研究对于推动LLMs成为更加公正、透明和包容的技术具有重要意义。 <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with the potential to benefit society immensely, yet, they have demonstrated biases that perpetuate societal inequalities. Despite significant advancements in bias mitigation techniques using data augmentation, zero-shot prompting, and model fine-tuning, biases continuously persist, including subtle biases that may elude human detection. Recent research has shown a growing interest in multi-LLM approaches, which have been demonstrated to be effective in improving the quality of reasoning and factuality in LLMs. Building on this approach, we propose a novel multi-LLM debiasing framework aimed at reducing bias in LLMs. Our work is the first to introduce and evaluate two distinct approaches within this framework for debiasing LLMs: a centralized method, where the conversation is facilitated by a single central LLM, and a decentralized method, where all models communicate directly. Our findings reveal that our multi-LLM framework significantly reduces bias in LLMs, outperforming the baseline method across several social groups.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of adaptively controlling the bias parameter in nonlinear opinion dynamics (NOD) to allocate agents into groups of arbitrary sizes for the purpose of maximizing collective rewards. In previous work, an algorithm based on the coupling of NOD with an multi-objective behavior optimization was successfully deployed as part of a multi-robot system in an autonomous task allocation field experiment. Motivated by the field results, in this paper we propose and analyze a new task allocation model that synthesizes NOD with an evolutionary game framework. We prove sufficient conditions under which it is possible to control the opinion state in the group to a desired allocation of agents between two tasks through an adaptive bias using decentralized feedback. We then verify the theoretical results with a simulation study of a collaborative evolutionary division of labor game.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) globally has catalyzed the need for robust cybersecurity measures within vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks. As these networks are increasingly being integrated into smart charging infrastructures, they also introduce new vulnerabilities that threaten grid stability and user privacy This paper proposes a cyber-physical authentication protocol and trading smart contract tailored to plug and charge (PnC) operations within blockchain-based V2G systems. The protocol leverages advanced cryptographic techniques and blockchain to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof energy transactions between EVs and charging stations. Key contributions include the development of a cyber-physical authentication method, the implementation of a smart contract framework for secure energy trading, and a detailed security and privacy analysis. The proposed protocol effectively mitigates risks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks and replay attacks while preserving user anonymity and data integrity.

<div> 关键词：Decentralized Federated Learning（DFL）、Centralized Federated Learning（CFL）、Privacy、Mutual Information、Secure Aggregation（SA）

<br /><br />
总结:

本文主要探讨了去中心化联邦学习(DFL)与集中式联邦学习(CFL)在隐私保护方面的差异。研究发现，尽管DFL因其去中心化的特性被认为在一定程度上提高了数据隐私，但Pasquini等人的研究挑战了这一观点，指出在某些假设下，DFL并不能显著提高隐私保护能力。为了深入分析这一问题，文章引入了一种基于信息论的理论框架，通过计算互信息来量化隐私泄漏。

研究还对增强隐私的技术，如安全聚合(SA)，在DFL和CFL中的有效性进行了评估。通过模拟和实际实验，结果表明，在不完全信任服务器的情况下，DFL通常能提供更强的隐私保护。文章指出，前人研究中关于网络拓扑结构和隐私攻击假设的局限性未能充分反映联邦学习中的信息泄露情况。

最后，研究揭示了先前研究中存在的不足之处，特别是在对网络结构和攻击模式的假设上，这些假设可能过于理想化，无法全面反映现实场景中的信息泄露风险。因此，该文为理解联邦学习中的隐私保护机制提供了新的视角，并强调了构建更精确理论模型的重要性。 <div>

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has garnered attention for its robustness and scalability compared to Centralized Federated Learning (CFL). While DFL is commonly believed to offer privacy advantages due to the decentralized control of sensitive data, recent work by Pasquini et, al. challenges this view, demonstrating that DFL does not inherently improve privacy against empirical attacks under certain assumptions. For investigating fully this issue, a formal theoretical framework is required. Our study offers a novel perspective by conducting a rigorous information-theoretical analysis of privacy leakage in FL using mutual information. We further investigate the effectiveness of privacy-enhancing techniques like Secure Aggregation (SA) in both CFL and DFL. Our simulations and real-world experiments show that DFL generally offers stronger privacy preservation than CFL in practical scenarios where a fully trusted server is not available. We address discrepancies in previous research by highlighting limitations in their assumptions about graph topology and privacy attacks, which inadequately capture information leakage in FL.

总结:
本文提出了一种名为C-sync的基于聚类的分布式时间同步协议，旨在解决物联网网络中设备间的时间同步问题。该协议具有故障容忍性，能够在网络中检测并隔离故障，从而快速恢复。与现有解决方案相比，C-sync通过引入多个参考节点来限制任何节点到其时间源的最大跳数，从而实现规模扩展。此外，C-sync在Contiki平台上采用模块化结构，支持应用程序转换。研究团队在真实测试床上进行了实验，该测试床由分布在不同楼层的40多个Tmote Sky硬件节点组成。实验结果表明，C-sync在最坏和最佳情况下分别减少了56.12%和75.75%的功率消耗，同时保持了与最先进的协议相当的准确性。与提供无/有限容错的分布式协议（源自GTSP）进行比较时，C-sync在能效和故障恢复方面表现出色。 <div>

Abstract: Time synchronization of devices in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks is one of the challenging problems and a pre-requisite for the design of low-latency applications. Although many existing solutions have tried to address this problem, almost all solutions assume all the devices (nodes) in the network are faultless. Furthermore, these solutions exchange a large number of messages to achieve synchronization, leading to significant communication and energy overhead. To address these shortcomings, we propose C-sync, a clustering-based decentralized time synchronization protocol that provides resilience against several types of faults with energy-efficient communication. C-sync achieves scalability by introducing multiple reference nodes in the network that restrict the maximum number of hops any node can have to its time source. The protocol is designed with a modular structure on the Contiki platform to allow application transitions. We evaluate C-sync on a real testbed that comprises over 40 Tmote Sky hardware nodes distributed across different levels in a building and show through experiments the fault resilience, energy efficiency, and scalability of the protocol. C-sync detects and isolates faults to a cluster and recovers quickly. The evaluation makes a qualitative comparison with state-of-the-art protocols and a quantitative comparison with a class of decentralized protocols (derived from GTSP) that provide synchronization with no/limited fault-tolerance. Results also show a reduction of 56.12% and 75.75% in power consumption in the worst-case and best-case scenarios, respectively, compared to GTSP, while achieving similar accuracy.

Abstract: Blockchain technology is an emerging digital innovation that has gained immense popularity in enhancing individual security and privacy within Information Systems (IS). This surge in interest is reflected in the exponential increase in research articles published on blockchain technology, highlighting its growing significance in the digital landscape. However, the rapid proliferation of published research presents significant challenges for manual analysis and synthesis due to the vast volume of information. The complexity and breadth of topics, combined with the inherent limitations of human data processing capabilities, make it difficult to comprehensively analyze and draw meaningful insights from the literature. To this end, we adopted the Computational Literature Review (CLR) to analyze pertinent literature impact and topic modelling using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. We identified 10 topics related to security and privacy and provided a detailed description of each topic. From the critical analysis, we have observed several limitations, and several future directions are provided as an outcome of this review.

Abstract: Distributed energy resources (DERs) are gaining prominence due to their advantages in improving energy efficiency, reducing carbon emissions, and enhancing grid resilience. Despite the increasing deployment, the potential of DERs has yet to be fully explored and exploited. A fundamental question restrains the management of numerous DERs in large-scale power systems, "How should DER data be securely processed and DER operations be efficiently optimized?" To address this question, this paper considers two critical issues, namely privacy for processing DER data and scalability in optimizing DER operations, then surveys existing and emerging solutions from a multi-agent framework perspective. In the context of scalability, this paper reviews state-of-the-art research that relies on parallel control, optimization, and learning within distributed and/or decentralized information exchange structures, while in the context of privacy, it identifies privacy preservation measures that can be synthesized into the aforementioned scalable structures. Despite research advances in these areas, challenges remain because these highly interdisciplinary studies blend a wide variety of scalable computing architectures and privacy preservation techniques from different fields, making them difficult to adapt in practice. To mitigate this issue, this paper provides a holistic review of trending strategies that orchestrate privacy and scalability for large-scale power system operations from a multi-agent perspective, particularly for DER control problems. Furthermore, this review extrapolates new approaches for future scalable, privacy-aware, and cybersecure pathways to unlock the full potential of DERs through controlling, optimizing, and learning generic multi-agent-based cyber-physical systems.

Abstract: Version control systems (VCS) are essential for software development, yet centralized VCS present risks such as data loss, security breaches, and ownership disputes. While blockchain-based approaches to decentralized source code repository hosting have been explored, many existing solutions struggle with challenges related to security, scalability, efficiency, and real-time collaboration. This study seeks to enhance these efforts by proposing a novel decentralized solution that leverages the Ethereum blockchain and IPFS for secure, efficient, and resilient code repository hosting and governance. Our approach introduces a hybrid architecture that combines the immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain with the efficiency of IPFS for off-chain storage. To facilitate real-time collaboration, we integrate a temporary centralized Middleman IPFS that manages transaction processing and enhances operational efficiency without compromising long-term security. This Middleman IPFS acts as an intermediary, balancing the speed of centralized systems with the resilience of decentralized architectures. Our system uses smart contracts to maintain access control and key management by dynamically verifying access rights, ensuring that only authorized users can retrieve and decrypt data stored on IPFS. This integration allows for secure, real-time collaboration in environments where multiple collaborators need concurrent access to shared resources. Our system employs a hybrid encryption scheme that combines symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. The encrypted keys are stored on the blockchain, while IPFS handles the efficient storage of the codebase itself, with a Middleman IPFS maintaining concurrent collaboration, providing a robust and scalable solution for managing large-scale, collaborative coding projects.

Abstract: The proliferation of blockchain-backed cryptocurrencies has sparked the need for cross-chain exchanges of diverse digital assets. Unfortunately, current exchanges suffer from high on-chain verification costs, weak threat models of central trusted parties, or synchronous requirements, making them impractical for currency trading applications. In this paper, we present MERCURY, a practical cryptocurrency exchange that is trust-minimized and efficient without online-client requirements. MERCURY leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to shield participants from malicious behaviors, eliminating the reliance on trusted participants and making on-chain verification efficient. Despite the simple idea, building a practical TEE-assisted cross-chain exchange is challenging due to the security and unavailability issues of TEEs. MERCURY tackles the unavailability problem of TEEs by implementing an efficient challenge-response mechanism executed on smart contracts. Furthermore, MERCURY utilizes a lightweight transaction verification mechanism and adopts multiple optimizations to reduce on-chain costs. Comparative evaluations with XClaim, ZK-bridge, and Tesseract demonstrate that MERCURY significantly reduces on-chain costs by approximately 67.87%, 45.01%, and 47.70%, respectively.

Abstract: Rollups have emerged as a promising approach to improving blockchains' scalability by offloading transactions execution off-chain. Existing rollup solutions either leverage complex zero-knowledge proofs or optimistically assume execution correctness unless challenged. However, these solutions have practical issues such as high gas costs and significant withdrawal delays, hindering their adoption in decentralized applications. This paper introduces TeeRollup, an efficient rollup design with low gas costs and short withdrawal delays. TeeRollup employs Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)-supported sequencers to execute transactions, requiring the blockchain to verify only the TEEs' signatures. TeeRollup is designed under a realistic threat model in which the integrity and availability of sequencers' TEEs may be compromised. To address these issues, we first introduce a distributed system of sequencers with heterogeneous TEEs, ensuring system security even if a minority of TEEs are compromised. Second, we propose a challenge mechanism to solve the redeemability issue caused by TEE unavailability. Furthermore, TeeRollup incorporates Data Availability Providers (DAPs) to reduce on-chain storage overhead and uses a laziness penalty game to regulate DAP behavior. We implement a prototype of TeeRollup in Golang, using the Ethereum test network, Sepolia. Our experimental results indicate that TeeRollup outperforms zero-knowledge rollups (zk-rollups), reducing on-chain verification costs by approximately 86% and withdrawal delays to a few minutes.

<title>Loopy Movements: Emergence of Rotation in a Multicellular Robot</title>

<div> 关键词：生物系统、Loopy机器人、分散式旋转、自组织、适应性

总结:

本文研究了Loopy多细胞机器人中的自发分散式旋转现象。Loopy由同质的、物理相连的单自由度单元组成，通过模拟化学物质（即形态发生器）的扩散、反应和主动运输进行简单的局部交互，而无需中央控制或全局形态知识。这些交互使机器人能够自我组织并实现协调的旋转运动，形成局部凸起——由电机细胞集群产生的局部突出。研究发现，Loopy表现出两种独特行为：1）内部山谷之间的旋转速度比外部峰顶快，与刚体动力学相反；2）细胞的旋转方向与整体形态相反。

实验表明，尽管Loopy的形态对相对环境而言的角速度没有影响，但较大的叶片会增加细胞的旋转速度并降低形态的旋转速度。即使有三分之一的执行器失效并经历显著的形态变化，Loopy仍能保持其旋转能力。这揭示了分散式、生物启发策略在构建具有韧性和适应性的机器人系统方面的潜力。 <div>

Abstract: Unlike most human-engineered systems, many biological systems rely on emergent behaviors from low-level interactions, enabling greater diversity and superior adaptation to complex, dynamic environments. This study explores emergent decentralized rotation in the Loopy multicellular robot, composed of homogeneous, physically linked, 1-degree-of-freedom cells. Inspired by biological systems like sunflowers, Loopy uses simple local interactions-diffusion, reaction, and active transport of simulated chemicals, called morphogens-without centralized control or knowledge of its global morphology. Through these interactions, the robot self-organizes to achieve coordinated rotational motion and forms lobes-local protrusions created by clusters of motor cells. This study investigates how these interactions drive Loopy's rotation, the impact of its morphology, and its resilience to actuator failures. Our findings reveal two distinct behaviors: 1) inner valleys between lobes rotate faster than the outer peaks, contrasting with rigid body dynamics, and 2) cells rotate in the opposite direction of the overall morphology. The experiments show that while Loopy's morphology does not affect its angular velocity relative to its cells, larger lobes increase cellular rotation and decrease morphology rotation relative to the environment. Even with up to one-third of its actuators disabled and significant morphological changes, Loopy maintains its rotational abilities, highlighting the potential of decentralized, bio-inspired strategies for resilient and adaptable robotic systems.

总结:
本文聚焦于智能合约领域中的安全问题，指出智能合约因其独特的性质而成为攻击者青睐的目标。现有的智能合约验证工具在表达和验证与加密资产交换相关的流动性属性方面存在局限性。为解决这一问题，作者提出了一种名为“Solvent”的新型验证工具。Solvent旨在验证那些现有验证工具难以处理的流动性属性，如用户是否能在任何可达状态下通过一系列交易提取特定数量的加密资产。

Abstract: Smart contracts are an attractive target for attackers, as evidenced by a long history of security incidents. A current limitation of smart contract verification tools is that they are not really effective in expressing and verifying liquidity properties regarding the exchange of crypto-assets: for example, is it true that in every reachable state a user can fire a sequence of transactions to withdraw a given amount of crypto-assets? We propose Solvent, a tool aimed at verifying these kinds of properties, which are beyond the reach of existing verification tools for Solidity. We evaluate the effectiveness and performance of Solvent through a common benchmark of smart contracts.

本文研究了去中心化金融(DeFi)如何通过直接交易和消除中介，重塑传统金融领域，并引入了Layer 2(L2)解决方案以增强DeFi生态系统的可扩展性和效率。然而，L2解决方案的影响仍需深入探索，主要是因为缺乏全面的交易数据索引供经济分析使用。为了填补这一空白，研究团队分析了来自Uniswap的主要去中心化交易所超过5千万笔交易的数据，横跨L1和L2网络。他们从以太坊区块链数据中创建了一系列每日指标，涵盖了DeFi采用、可扩展性、去中心化和财富分配等方面。此外，研究团队还开发了一个开源Python框架来计算去中心化指数，使得该数据集对高级机器学习研究极具价值。这项工作提供了宝贵的数据资源，对数据科学家而言意义重大，并有助于推动智能Web3生态系统的发展。 <div>

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is reshaping traditional finance by enabling direct transactions without intermediaries, creating a rich source of open financial data. Layer 2 (L2) solutions are emerging to enhance the scalability and efficiency of the DeFi ecosystem, surpassing Layer 1 (L1) systems. However, the impact of L2 solutions is still underexplored, mainly due to the lack of comprehensive transaction data indices for economic analysis. This study bridges that gap by analyzing over 50 million transactions from Uniswap, a major decentralized exchange, across both L1 and L2 networks. We created a set of daily indices from blockchain data on Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon, offering insights into DeFi adoption, scalability, decentralization, and wealth distribution. Additionally, we developed an open-source Python framework for calculating decentralization indices, making this dataset highly useful for advanced machine learning research. Our work provides valuable resources for data scientists and contributes to the growth of the intelligent Web3 ecosystem.

总结:
本文评估了五种现代区块链系统（Algorand、Aptos、Avalanche、Redbelly和Solana）的故障容忍能力。研究中引入了一种新颖的敏感度指标，通过比较基线环境和对抗环境下的两个累积分布函数的积分差来量化这一指标。结果显示：

1. 除了Redbelly外，所有区块链系统都对网络中一小部分节点的失效高度敏感。
2. Avalanche和Redbelly得益于冗余信息，这有助于实现拜占庭容错，而其他系统则因冗余而受到阻碍。
3. 更为显著的是，Avalanche和Solana无法从局部瞬态故障中恢复。

这项研究揭示了区块链系统的故障容忍性存在显著差异，特别是当考虑特定于系统的架构决策时。这些发现对于理解区块链在实际部署中的可靠性和选择最适合特定需求的区块链技术至关重要。 <div>

Abstract: Blockchain promises to make online services more fault tolerant due to their inherent distributed nature. Their ability to execute arbitrary programs in different geo-distributed regions and on diverse operating systems make them an alternative of choice to our dependence on unique software whose recent failure affected 8.5 millions of machines. As of today, it remains, however, unclear whether blockchains can truly tolerate failures.
  In this paper, we assess the fault tolerance of blockchain. To this end, we inject failures in controlled deployments of five modern blockchain systems, namely Algorand, Aptos, Avalanche, Redbelly and Solana. We introduce a novel sensitivity metric, interesting in its own right, as the difference between the integrals of two cumulative distribution functions, one obtained in a baseline environment and one obtained in an adversarial environment. Our results indicate that (i) all blockchains except Redbelly are highly impacted by the failure of a small part of their network, (ii) Avalanche and Redbelly benefit from the redundant information needed for Byzantine fault tolerance while others are hampered by it, and more dramatically (iii) Avalanche and Solana cannot recover from localised transient failures.

Abstract: This paper presents experiments for embedded cooperative distributed model predictive control applied to a team of hovercraft floating on an air hockey table. The hovercraft collectively solve a centralized optimal control problem in each sampling step via a stabilizing decentralized real-time iteration scheme using the alternating direction method of multipliers. The efficient implementation does not require a central coordinator, executes onboard the hovercraft, and facilitates sampling intervals in the millisecond range. The formation control experiments showcase the flexibility of the approach on scenarios with point-to-point transitions, trajectory tracking, collision avoidance, and moving obstacles.

总结:
本文提出了一种针对联邦学习(Federated Learning, FL)的新算法，旨在提高模型对通信噪声的鲁棒性同时减少通信负载。通过将权重最小二乘法(WLS)回归问题作为示例，构建了一个分布式凸优化问题，该问题在具有随机调度的联邦网络中进行了解。应用交替方向乘子法(ADMM)解决这一问题。为对抗累积通信噪声的负面影响，引入关键修改，通过消除双变量和在每个参与客户端实施新的局部模型更新，使得每个客户端只需使用一次有噪声的全局模型更新，而非两次，从而提高了对加性通信噪声的鲁棒性。此外，通过允许客户端在未被服务器选择时继续进行本地更新，进一步提升了算法性能。理论分析证实了算法在通信噪声和服务器随机选择客户端的迭代过程中的收敛性，无论是在均值还是均方意义上。数值结果验证了所提算法的有效性，并与理论发现相吻合。 <div>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) leverages client-server communications to train global models on decentralized data. However, communication noise or errors can impair model accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel FL algorithm that enhances robustness against communication noise while also reducing communication load. We derive the proposed algorithm through solving the weighted least-squares (WLS) regression problem as an illustrative example. We first frame WLS regression as a distributed convex optimization problem over a federated network employing random scheduling for improved communication efficiency. We then apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to iteratively solve this problem. To counteract the detrimental effects of cumulative communication noise, we introduce a key modification by eliminating the dual variable and implementing a new local model update at each participating client. This subtle yet effective change results in using a single noisy global model update at each client instead of two, improving robustness against additive communication noise. Furthermore, we incorporate another modification enabling clients to continue local updates even when not selected by the server, leading to substantial performance improvements. Our theoretical analysis confirms the convergence of our algorithm in both mean and the mean-square senses, even when the server communicates with a random subset of clients over noisy links at each iteration. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and corroborate our theoretical findings.

总结:
文章介绍了一款名为Proxion的自动化跨合约分析工具，其主要功能在于识别Ethereum中的代理智能合约及其可能存在的冲突。与以往工具相比，Proxion的独特之处在于它能分析那些缺乏源代码和历史交易记录的隐藏智能合约。通过采用多种提升效率和准确性的技术手段，Proxion在识别代理智能合约的数量和检测未被报道的冲突方面表现出色，显著超越了现有工具。研究发现，从2015年到2023年的活跃合约中，有54.2%是代理合约，约有150万个合约存在至少一个冲突问题。

Proxion的开发旨在解决代理智能合约设计模式中存在的安全问题，特别是函数碰撞和存储碰撞。这些安全漏洞曾在现实世界中导致用户大量数字资产被盗。通过使用Proxion进行深入分析，可以更全面地识别并预防这类风险，为智能合约的安全性和稳定性提供重要保障。同时，该工具的广泛应用有助于提高整个区块链生态系统的安全性，防止未来类似事件的发生。 <div>

Abstract: The proxy design pattern allows Ethereum smart contracts to be simultaneously immutable and upgradeable, in which an original contract is split into a proxy contract containing the data storage and a logic contract containing the implementation logic. This architecture is known to have security issues, namely function collisions and storage collisions between the proxy and logic contracts, and has been exploited in real-world incidents to steal users' millions of dollars worth of digital assets. In response to this concern, several previous works have sought to identify proxy contracts in Ethereum and detect their collisions. However, they all fell short due to their limited coverage, often restricting analysis to only contracts with available source code or past transactions.
  To bridge this gap, we present Proxion, an automated cross-contract analyzer that identifies all proxy smart contracts and their collisions in Ethereum. What sets Proxion apart is its ability to analyze hidden smart contracts that lack both source code and past transactions. Equipped with various techniques to enhance efficiency and accuracy, Proxion outperforms the state-of-the-art tools, notably identifying millions more proxy contracts and thousands of unreported collisions. We apply Proxion to analyze over 36 million alive contracts from 2015 to 2023, revealing that 54.2% of them are proxy contracts, and about 1.5 million contracts exhibit at least one collision issue.

Abstract: Public key infrastructures are essential for Internet security, ensuring robust certificate management and revocation mechanisms. The transition from centralized to decentralized systems presents challenges such as trust distribution and privacy-preserving credential management. The transition from centralized to decentralized systems is motivated by addressing the single points of failure inherent in centralized systems and leveraging decentralized technologies' transparency and resilience. This paper explores the evolution of certificate status management from centralized to decentralized frameworks, focusing on blockchain technology and advanced cryptography. We provide a taxonomy of the challenges of centralized systems and discuss opportunities provided by existing decentralized technologies. Our findings reveal that, although blockchain technologies enhance security and trust distribution, they represent a bottleneck for parallel computation and face inefficiencies in cryptographic computations. For this reason, we propose a framework of decentralized technology components that addresses such shortcomings to advance the paradigm shift toward decentralized credential status management.

Abstract: Stochastic optimization problems in large-scale multi-stakeholder networked systems (e.g., power grids and supply chains) rely on data-driven scenarios to encapsulate complex spatiotemporal interdependencies. However, centralized aggregation of stakeholder data is challenging due to the existence of data silos resulting from computational and logistical bottlenecks. In this paper, we present SplitVAEs, a decentralized scenario generation framework that leverages variational autoencoders to generate high-quality scenarios without moving stakeholder data. With the help of experiments on distributed memory systems, we demonstrate the broad applicability of SplitVAEs in a variety of domain areas that are dominated by a large number of stakeholders. Our experiments indicate that SplitVAEs can learn spatial and temporal interdependencies in large-scale networks to generate scenarios that match the joint historical distribution of stakeholder data in a decentralized manner. Our experiments show that SplitVAEs deliver robust performance compared to centralized, state-of-the-art benchmark methods while significantly reducing data transmission costs, leading to a scalable, privacy-enhancing alternative to scenario generation.

总结:
本文提出了一种基于数据驱动的全分布式方法，用于设计适用于大规模互联网络的安全控制器，这些网络中的子系统具有未知的数学模型。该方法通过利用互联拓扑结构，将网络分析分解为对不同子系统的单独检查。为了捕获子系统之间的联合耗散性质，引入了控制存储证书（CSCs）的概念。CSCs在通过数据组成的推导中起着关键作用，以获得专为此互联网络设计的控制障碍证书（CBC），从而确保其安全性。

在数据驱动的方案中，仅需从每个未知子系统收集一段输入输出轨迹。通过满足特定的秩条件，可以构造出每个子系统的CSC。接着，遵循组成性耗散推理，将数据生成的CSCs组合起来，构建出未知网络的CBC，确保其在无限时间内的安全性，同时提供正确的保证。这种方法显著提高了CBC及其安全控制器在整个互联网络中的设计效率，通过将计算复杂度从与网络维度相关的多项式增长降低到与子系统数量成线性的比例，利用了互联拓扑的结构并可能不受子系统数量的影响来满足耗散型组成性条件。

Abstract: We introduce a compositional data-driven methodology for designing fully-decentralized safety controllers applicable to large-scale interconnected networks, encompassing subsystems with unknown mathematical models. Our compositional scheme leverages the interconnection topology and breaks down the network analysis into the examination of distinct subsystems. This is accompanied by utilizing a concept of control storage certificates (CSCs) to capture joint dissipativity-type properties among subsystems. These CSCs are instrumental in a compositional derivation of a control barrier certificate (CBC) specialized for the interconnected network, thereby ensuring its safety. In our data-driven scheme, we gather solely one input-output trajectory from each unknown subsystem within a specified time frame. By fulfilling a specific rank condition, this process facilitates the construction of a CSC for each subsystem. Following this, by adhering to compositional dissipativity reasoning, we compose CSCs derived from data and build a CBC for the unknown network, ensuring its safety over an infinite time horizon, while providing correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that our compositional data-driven approach significantly enhances the design of a CBC and its safety controller across the interconnected network. This advancement is achieved by reducing the computational complexity from a polynomial growth in relation to network dimension, when using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization, to a linear scale based on the number of subsystems. We additionally demonstrate that the dissipativity-type compositionality condition can benefit from the structure of interconnection topology and potentially be fulfilled regardless of the number of subsystems. We apply our data-driven findings to a variety of benchmarks, involving physical networks with unknown models and diverse interconnection topologies.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a fully-decentralized multi-agent policy evaluation problem, which is an important sub-problem in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, in the presence of up to $f$ faulty agents. In particular, we focus on the so-called Byzantine faulty model with model poisoning setting. In general, policy evaluation is to evaluate the value function of any given policy. In cooperative multi-agent system, the system-wide rewards are usually modeled as the uniform average of rewards from all agents. We investigate the multi-agent policy evaluation problem in the presence of Byzantine agents, particularly in the setting of heterogeneous local rewards. Ideally, the goal of the agents is to evaluate the accumulated system-wide rewards, which are uniform average of rewards of the normal agents for a given policy. It means that all agents agree upon common values (the consensus part) and furthermore, the consensus values are the value functions (the convergence part). However, we prove that this goal is not achievable. Instead, we consider a relaxed version of the problem, where the goal of the agents is to evaluate accumulated system-wide reward, which is an appropriately weighted average reward of the normal agents. We further prove that there is no correct algorithm that can guarantee that the total number of positive weights exceeds $|\mathcal{N}|-f $, where $|\mathcal{N}|$ is the number of normal agents. Towards the end, we propose a Byzantine-tolerant decentralized temporal difference algorithm that can guarantee asymptotic consensus under scalar function approximation. We then empirically test the effective of the proposed algorithm.

<div> 关键词：多代理交互、异质团队、交叉反应性、资源优化、免疫系统启发

总结:

本文提出了一种模型，用于研究异质团队的代理如何组织资源以应对异质攻击者。该模型灵感源自人体免疫系统对抗多样病原体的方式。关键特征是“交叉反应性”核函数，它使得特定防御类型能够强烈响应某些攻击类型，但对少数不同的攻击类型则响应较弱。研究表明，由于这种交叉反应性，防御团队可以使用非常少的防御代理类型来最优地对抗异质攻击团队，从而最小化其资源消耗。

文章在不同设置下研究了此模型，以识别控制问题中异质代理团队的指导原则，包括损害敏感性对非最优防御分布的影响以及防御者之间的竞争如何导致接近最优行为的分散式计算。此外，与现有的方法进行了比较，如基于强化学习的策略、围栏防御和覆盖控制等。

该模型提供了一个新颖的方法论框架，旨在通过借鉴免疫系统的策略，为复杂多代理系统的资源分配和协调提供理论基础与实践指导。 <div>

Abstract: We introduce a model for multi-agent interaction problems to understand how a heterogeneous team of agents should organize its resources to tackle a heterogeneous team of attackers. This model is inspired by how the human immune system tackles a diverse set of pathogens. The key property of this model is a ``cross-reactivity'' kernel which enables a particular defender type to respond strongly to some attacker types but weakly to a few different types of attackers. We show how due to such cross-reactivity, the defender team can optimally counteract a heterogeneous attacker team using very few types of defender agents, and thereby minimize its resources. We study this model in different settings to characterize a set of guiding principles for control problems with heterogeneous teams of agents, e.g., sensitivity of the harm to sub-optimal defender distributions, and competition between defenders gives near-optimal behavior using decentralized computation of the control. We also compare this model with existing approaches including reinforcement-learned policies, perimeter defense, and coverage control.

本文主要关注于构建一个大规模的智能合约弱点数据集，以评估智能合约分析工具的性能。首先，通过分析1199份开源审计报告，从29个安全团队中识别出了9154个弱点，并创建了两个数据集：DAPPSCAN-SOURCE和DAPPSCAN-BYTECODE。其中，DAPPSCAN-SOURCE包含了39904个Solidity文件，以及源自682个真实DApp项目的1618个SWC弱点。然而，这些Solidity文件可能无法直接编译进行进一步分析。为了促进自动化分析，开发了一个工具来识别DApp项目中的依赖关系并完成缺失的公共库。基于此，创建了DAPPSCAN-BYTECODE数据集，其中包括6665个已编译的智能合约及888个SWC弱点。

在DAPPSCAN-BYTECODE数据集上进行了实证研究，评估了最先进的智能合约弱点检测工具的性能。结果显示，这些工具在有效性和成功检测率方面表现不佳，表明未来的研究应优先考虑现实世界的数据集，而非简单的玩具合同。 <div>

Abstract: The Smart Contract Weakness Classification Registry (SWC Registry) is a widely recognized list of smart contract weaknesses specific to the Ethereum platform. Despite the SWC Registry not being updated with new entries since 2020, the sustained development of smart contract analysis tools for detecting SWC-listed weaknesses highlights their ongoing significance in the field. However, evaluating these tools has proven challenging due to the absence of a large, unbiased, real-world dataset. To address this problem, we aim to build a large-scale SWC weakness dataset from real-world DApp projects. We recruited 22 participants and spent 44 person-months analyzing 1,199 open-source audit reports from 29 security teams. In total, we identified 9,154 weaknesses and developed two distinct datasets, i.e., DAPPSCAN-SOURCE and DAPPSCAN-BYTECODE. The DAPPSCAN-SOURCE dataset comprises 39,904 Solidity files, featuring 1,618 SWC weaknesses sourced from 682 real-world DApp projects. However, the Solidity files in this dataset may not be directly compilable for further analysis. To facilitate automated analysis, we developed a tool capable of automatically identifying dependency relationships within DApp projects and completing missing public libraries. Using this tool, we created DAPPSCAN-BYTECODE dataset, which consists of 6,665 compiled smart contract with 888 SWC weaknesses. Based on DAPPSCAN-BYTECODE, we conducted an empirical study to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art smart contract weakness detection tools. The evaluation results revealed sub-par performance for these tools in terms of both effectiveness and success detection rate, indicating that future development should prioritize real-world datasets over simplistic toy contracts.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of the Internet, particularly the emergence of Web3, has transformed the ways people interact and share data. Web3, although still not well defined, is thought to be a return to the decentralization of corporations' power over user data. Despite the obsolescence of the idea of building systems to detect and prevent cyber intrusions, this is still a topic of interest. This paper proposes a novel conceptual approach for implementing decentralized collaborative intrusion detection networks (CIDN) through a proof-of-concept. The study employs an analytical and comparative methodology, examining the synergy between cutting-edge Web3 technologies and information security. The proposed model incorporates blockchain concepts, cyber non-fungible token (cyberNFT) rewards, machine learning algorithms, and publish/subscribe architectures. Finally, the paper discusses the strengths and limitations of the proposed system, offering insights into the potential of decentralized cybersecurity models.

<div> 关键词：分布式数字（DDD）账本、区块链、多级验证、系统层次结构、系统故障概率

总结:

本文提出了一种利用具有多层次验证的去中心化分布式数字（DDD）账本（如区块链）的新方法。在传统的DDD账本中，仅提供单一级别的验证，这在需要在各个层级进行验证的系统中并不适用。引入层次结构意味着在同一层级内可以有多个验证，甚至多于一个级别的验证，从而引发不同层次间交互带来的新挑战，例如当前层级验证上一级层的工作。

文章旨在解决这些复杂性，为系统状态的追踪提供一种路线图，并计算系统的故障概率。通过多层次验证体系，能够更有效地处理存在自然层次结构的系统，确保数据的完整性和一致性。同时，这种方法还考虑了不同层次间的依赖关系和验证过程，以增强系统的整体稳定性和可靠性。

通过引入多层次验证机制，文章提供了一个全面的框架，不仅解决了传统DDD账本在处理层次化系统时的局限性，还为预测和管理系统故障提供了新的可能性。这一创新方法有望在需要高度可靠和透明数据记录的领域中得到广泛应用。 <div>

Abstract: This paper presents an approach to using decentralized distributed digital (DDD) ledgers like blockchain with multi-level verification. In regular DDD ledgers like Blockchain, only a single level of verification is available, which makes it not useful for those systems where there is a hierarchy and verification is required on each level. In systems where hierarchy emerges naturally, the inclusion of hierarchy in the solution for the problem of the system enables us to come up with a better solution. Introduction to hierarchy means there could be several verification within a level in the hierarchy and more than one level of verification, which implies other challenges induced by an interaction between the various levels of hierarchies that also need to be addressed, like verification of the work of the previous level of hierarchy by given level in the hierarchy. The paper will address all these issues, and provide a road map to trace the state of the system at any given time and probability of failure of the system.

总结:本文主要介绍了联邦学习（FL）作为分布式机器学习的一种范式，其在保护数据隐私的同时实现合作模型训练的潜力。特别是在医疗和电网等敏感领域，由于大多数数据为私有、机密且分布广泛，FL成为了一种有前景的方法来有效利用这些数据。然而，异构性和安全性是联邦学习面临的关键挑战，许多现有的联邦学习框架要么未能充分解决这些问题，要么缺乏灵活性以引入新的解决方案。为此，作者提出了一种名为APPFL的可扩展框架和基准测试套件，旨在全面解决异构性和安全问题，并提供用户友好的界面以集成新算法或适应新应用。

APPFL通过大量实验评估了联邦学习的各个方面，包括通信效率、隐私保护、计算性能和资源使用情况。此外，通过垂直、层级和去中心化联邦学习的案例研究，展示了APPFL的可扩展性。该框架已开源发布在GitHub上，为研究人员和开发者提供了宝贵的资源。 <div>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm enabling collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. In today's landscape, where most data is proprietary, confidential, and distributed, FL has become a promising approach to leverage such data effectively, particularly in sensitive domains such as medicine and the electric grid. Heterogeneity and security are the key challenges in FL, however; most existing FL frameworks either fail to address these challenges adequately or lack the flexibility to incorporate new solutions. To this end, we present the recent advances in developing APPFL, an extensible framework and benchmarking suite for federated learning, which offers comprehensive solutions for heterogeneity and security concerns, as well as user-friendly interfaces for integrating new algorithms or adapting to new applications. We demonstrate the capabilities of APPFL through extensive experiments evaluating various aspects of FL, including communication efficiency, privacy preservation, computational performance, and resource utilization. We further highlight the extensibility of APPFL through case studies in vertical, hierarchical, and decentralized FL. APPFL is open-sourced at https://github.com/APPFL/APPFL.

总结:
本文提出了CountChain，一种针对计数系统的去中心化预言机网络，旨在解决区块链在行业应用中与链下数据连接受限的问题。CountChain通过让所有节点接收数据并允许任意节点发起提议请求，实现了数据的广泛收集。每个提议包含足够的信息以判断事件的发生。随后，随机选择的节点参与游戏，通过提供证据和赌注来验证提议的真实性。只有经过验证为真的提议才会增加智能合约中的计数器。这种机制改变了传统的模式，即智能合约主动调用预言机获取数据，而是由预言机在数据可用时主动调用智能合约。

为了优化系统性能，作者进行了详细参数分析和大规模数据点实验，以确定最佳配置。基于博弈论的分析表明，在合理的参与者行为下，存在纳什均衡状态，确保了所有理性参与者都能以诚实的方式参与其中。此研究为区块链技术在在线广告等依赖精确计数系统的行业中的应用提供了新的思路和解决方案。 <div>

Abstract: Blockchain integration in industries like online advertising is hindered by its connectivity limitations to off-chain data. These industries heavily rely on precise counting systems for collecting and analyzing off-chain data. This requires mechanisms, often called oracles, to feed off-chain data into smart contracts. However, current oracle solutions are ill-suited for counting systems since the oracles do not know when to expect the data, posing a significant challenge.
  To address this, we present CountChain, a decentralized oracle network for counting systems. In CountChain, data is received by all oracle nodes, and any node can submit a proposition request. Each proposition contains enough data to evaluate the occurrence of an event. Only randomly selected nodes participate in a game to evaluate the truthfulness of each proposition by providing proof and some stake. Finally, the propositions with the outcome of True increment the counter in a smart contract. Thus, instead of a contract calling oracles for data, in CountChain, the oracles call a smart contract when the data is available. Furthermore, we present a formal analysis and experimental evaluation of the system's parameters on over half a million data points to obtain optimal system parameters. In such conditions, our game-theoretical analysis demonstrates that a Nash equilibrium exists wherein all rational parties participate with honesty.

总结:

本文提出了一种针对小样本增量学习的联邦学习框架，旨在解决在保护数据隐私和安全的前提下，开发可扩展且适应性强的智能系统的问题。该框架允许客户端在本地更新模型以学习新类别的同时，保持数据的隐私性，并将模型更新发送到中央服务器进行全局聚合。

为应对小样本学习的挑战，如灾难性遗忘和数据异构性，作者引入了合成数据驱动的方法，通过回放缓冲区数据来维护已有知识并促进新知识的学习。具体地，他们设计了一个噪声感知生成回放模块，以平衡新数据和回放数据，对本地模型进行微调，同时生成新类别数据以进一步扩充回放缓冲区。此外，还提出了基于局部模型在合成数据上性能的分类特定加权聚合策略，以适应数据异构性问题，从而实现有效的全局模型优化，而无需直接访问客户端数据。

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning is crucial for developing scalable and adaptive intelligent systems, as it enables models to acquire new classes with minimal annotated data while safeguarding the previously accumulated knowledge. Nonetheless, existing methods deal with continuous data streams in a centralized manner, limiting their applicability in scenarios that prioritize data privacy and security. To this end, this paper introduces federated few-shot class-incremental learning, a decentralized machine learning paradigm tailored to progressively learn new classes from scarce data distributed across multiple clients. In this learning paradigm, clients locally update their models with new classes while preserving data privacy, and then transmit the model updates to a central server where they are aggregated globally. However, this paradigm faces several issues, such as difficulties in few-shot learning, catastrophic forgetting, and data heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we present a synthetic data-driven framework that leverages replay buffer data to maintain existing knowledge and facilitate the acquisition of new knowledge. Within this framework, a noise-aware generative replay module is developed to fine-tune local models with a balance of new and replay data, while generating synthetic data of new classes to further expand the replay buffer for future tasks. Furthermore, a class-specific weighted aggregation strategy is designed to tackle data heterogeneity by adaptively aggregating class-specific parameters based on local models performance on synthetic data. This enables effective global model optimization without direct access to client data. Comprehensive experiments across three widely-used datasets underscore the effectiveness and preeminence of the introduced framework.

Abstract: To address the intricate challenges of decentralized cooperative scheduling and motion planning in Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, this paper introduces LMMCoDrive, a novel cooperative driving framework that leverages a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) to enhance traffic efficiency in dynamic urban environments. This framework seamlessly integrates scheduling and motion planning processes to ensure the effective operation of Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). The spatial relationship between CAVs and passenger requests is abstracted into a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) to fully exploit the potential of the LMM. Besides, trajectories are cautiously refined for each CAV while ensuring collision avoidance through safety constraints. A decentralized optimization strategy, facilitated by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) within the LMM framework, is proposed to drive the graph evolution of CAVs. Simulation results demonstrate the pivotal role and significant impact of LMM in optimizing CAV scheduling and enhancing decentralized cooperative optimization process for each vehicle. This marks a substantial stride towards achieving practical, efficient, and safe AMoD systems that are poised to revolutionize urban transportation.

Abstract: Background: Health 3.0 allows decision making to be based on longitudinal data from multiple institutions, from across the patient's healthcare journey. In such a distributed setting, blockchain smart contracts can act as neutral intermediaries to implement trustworthy decision making.
  Objective: In a distributed setting, transmitted data will be structured using standards (such as HL7 FHIR) for semantic interoperability. In turn, the smart contract will require interoperability with this standard, implement a complex communication setup (e.g., using oracles), and be developed using blockchain languages (e.g., Solidity). We propose the encoding of smart contract logic using a high-level semantic Knowledge Graph, using concepts from the domain standard. We then deploy this semantic KG on blockchain.
  Methods: Off-chain, a code generation pipeline compiles the KG into a concrete smart contract, which is then deployed on-chain. Our pipeline targets an intermediary bridge representation, which can be transpiled into a specific blockchain language. Our choice avoids on-chain rule engines, with unpredictable and likely higher computational cost; it is thus in line with the economic rules of blockchain.
  Results: We applied our code generation approach to generate smart contracts for 3 health insurance cases from Medicare. We discuss the suitability of our approach - the need for a neutral intermediary - for a number of healthcare use cases. Our evaluation finds that the generated contracts perform well in terms of correctness and execution cost ("gas") on blockchain.
  Conclusions: We showed that it is feasible to automatically generate smart contract code based on a semantic KG, in a way that respects the economic rules of blockchain. Future work includes studying the use of Large Language Models (LLM) in our approach, and evaluations on other blockchains.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework to alleviate the data silos, where decentralized clients collaboratively learn a global model without sharing their private data. However, the clients' Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data negatively affect the trained model, and clients with different numbers of local updates may cause significant gaps to the local gradients in each communication round. In this paper, we propose a Federated Vectorized Averaging (FedVeca) method to address the above problem on Non-IID data. Specifically, we set a novel objective for the global model which is related to the local gradients. The local gradient is defined as a bi-directional vector with step size and direction, where the step size is the number of local updates and the direction is divided into positive and negative according to our definition. In FedVeca, the direction is influenced by the step size, thus we average the bi-directional vectors to reduce the effect of different step sizes. Then, we theoretically analyze the relationship between the step sizes and the global objective, and obtain upper bounds on the step sizes per communication round. Based on the upper bounds, we design an algorithm for the server and the client to adaptively adjusts the step sizes that make the objective close to the optimum. Finally, we conduct experiments on different datasets, models and scenarios by building a prototype system, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the FedVeca method.

总结:本文提出了一种基于分布式多代理强化学习(MARL)框架的新型多小区无线网络射频资源分配策略。通过让每个代理控制单个小区并根据局部信息进行频谱和功率分配，该方法实现了与使用全局信息的集中式方法相媲美的服务质量(QoS)表现，同时显著降低了执行时间。此研究将问题转化为分布式学习问题，利用多代理近端策略优化(MAPPO)算法结合循环神经网络和队列动力学来解决。这种交通驱动的MARL解决方案支持去中心化的训练与执行，确保了大型网络的可扩展性。通过广泛模拟验证，该方法不仅达到了与具备完美信息集中式算法相似的QoS性能，还展示了在不同网络规模和流量条件下的可扩展性和鲁棒性。 <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to radio resource allocation in multi-cell wireless networks using a fully scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. A distributed method is developed where agents control individual cells and determine spectrum and power allocation based on limited local information, yet achieve quality of service (QoS) performance comparable to centralized methods using global information. The objective is to minimize packet delays across devices under stochastic arrivals and applies to both conflict graph abstractions and cellular network configurations. This is formulated as a distributed learning problem, implementing a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm with recurrent neural networks and queueing dynamics. This traffic-driven MARL-based solution enables decentralized training and execution, ensuring scalability to large networks. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve comparable QoS performance to genie-aided centralized algorithms with significantly less execution time. The trained policies also exhibit scalability and robustness across various network sizes and traffic conditions.

Abstract: The large-scale deployment of Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum mainnet has increasingly attracted financially-motivated attackers in recent years. A few now-infamous attacks in Ethereum's history includes DAO attack in 2016 (50 million dollars lost), Parity Wallet hack in 2017 (146 million dollars locked), Beautychain's token BEC in 2018 (900 million dollars market value fell to 0), and NFT gaming blockchain breach in 2022 ($600 million in Ether stolen). This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of the use of large language models (LLMs) and their capabilities in detecting OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities in Solidity. We introduce a novel, class-balanced, structured, and labeled dataset named VulSmart, which we use to benchmark and compare the performance of open-source LLMs such as CodeLlama, Llama2, CodeT5 and Falcon, alongside closed-source models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o Mini. Our proposed SmartVD framework is rigorously tested against these models through extensive automated and manual evaluations, utilizing BLEU and ROUGE metrics to assess the effectiveness of vulnerability detection in smart contracts. We also explore three distinct prompting strategies-zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought-to evaluate the multi-class classification and generative capabilities of the SmartVD framework. Our findings reveal that SmartVD outperforms its open-source counterparts and even exceeds the performance of closed-source base models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Mini. After fine-tuning, the closed-source models, GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o Mini, achieved remarkable performance with 99% accuracy in detecting vulnerabilities, 94% in identifying their types, and 98% in determining severity. Notably, SmartVD performs best with the `chain-of-thought' prompting technique, whereas the fine-tuned closed-source models excel with the `zero-shot' prompting approach.

<div> 关键词：分布式共识、随机委员会选择、公平性、确定性边界、敌对影响

总结:
本文聚焦于分布式共识系统中的公平随机委员会选举过程，特别是采用加密抽签方法确保委员会大小恒定的方案。与现有协议提供的概率性保证不同，本文提出的新方法旨在提供确定性的边界，以限制委员会中敌对方的影响。通过引入创新方法和进行数值实验，文章证明了这种方法能够有效增强系统的去中心化特性。

具体而言，文章首先概述了区块链系统中基于稀缺资源（如股权、存储、内存或计算能力）的加权彩票机制在选择负责共识过程及添加新信息至区块链的委员会成员中的重要性。接着，作者对比了两种主要的随机委员会选择方法：一种是每个验证候选者在共识阶段本地检查是否当选并展示证明；另一种是使用排序算法决定固定大小的全球验证委员会。

文章的重点在于后者，特别是加密抽签方法，该方法确保委员会大小恒定，同时提供确定性边界来限制委员会中敌对方的影响力。这种策略克服了现有协议仅提供概率性保证的局限性，通常导致委员会规模过大，不适合许多基于多数原则的应用场景，如原子广播和随机信标协议。通过引入新的方法和分析，文章为实现更强大、更公平的去中心化系统提供了理论基础和实践指导。 <div>

Abstract: Consensus plays a crucial role in distributed ledger systems, impacting both scalability and decentralization. Many blockchain systems use a weighted lottery based on a scarce resource such as a stake, storage, memory, or computing power to select a committee whose members drive the consensus and are responsible for adding new information to the ledger. Therefore, ensuring a robust and fair committee selection process is essential for maintaining security, efficiency, and decentralization.
  There are two main approaches to randomized committee selection. In one approach, each validator candidate locally checks whether they are elected to the committee and reveals their proof during the consensus phase. In contrast, in the second approach, a sortition algorithm decides a fixed-sized committee that is globally verified. This paper focuses on the latter approach, with cryptographic sortition as a method for fair committee selection that guarantees a constant committee size. Our goal is to develop deterministic guarantees that strengthen decentralization. We introduce novel methods that provide deterministic bounds on the influence of adversaries within the committee, as evidenced by numerical experiments. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing protocols that only offer probabilistic guarantees, often providing large committees that are impractical for many quorum-based applications like atomic broadcast and randomness beacon protocols.

Abstract: Metaverse is a vast virtual world parallel to the physical world, where the user acts as an avatar to enjoy various services that break through the temporal and spatial limitations of the physical world. Metaverse allows users to create arbitrary digital appearances as their own avatars by which an adversary may disguise his/her avatar to fraud others. In this paper, we propose an anti-disguise authentication method that draws on the idea of the first impression from the physical world to recognize an old friend. Specifically, the first meeting scenario in the metaverse is stored and recalled to help the authentication between avatars. To prevent the adversary from replacing and forging the first impression, we construct a chameleon-based signcryption mechanism and design a ciphertext authentication protocol to ensure the public verifiability of encrypted identities. The security analysis shows that the proposed signcryption mechanism meets not only the security requirement but also the public verifiability. Besides, the ciphertext authentication protocol has the capability of defending against the replacing and forging attacks on the first impression. Extensive experiments show that the proposed avatar authentication system is able to achieve anti-disguise authentication at a low storage consumption on the blockchain.

<div> 关键词：Ethereum改进提案、Proto-Danksharding、数据分片、数据可用性、延迟模型

总结:
文章主要讨论了Ethereum改进提案EIP-4844中提出的Proto-Danksharding技术，该技术旨在通过引入名为blob-carrying交易的新类型来逐步提高以太坊区块链的可扩展性。这些交易将大型二进制对象（blob）存储于链下，但通过在链上引用和验证来确保数据可用性。通过将数据可用性与交易执行分离，Proto-Danksharding缓解了网络拥堵并降低了气体费用，为更高级的数据分片解决方案打下了基础。

文章提供了一个分析模型，用于推导这些新交易的延迟。通过将系统建模为$\mathrm{M/D}^B/1$队列，并通过嵌入马尔可夫链和辅助变量方法找到其稳态分布，作者证明了与较低blob数量但更高频率的交易相比，具有更多blob但更少频率的交易对系统的延迟影响更大。这一发现对于优化交易处理和提高整体网络效率至关重要。 <div>

Abstract: Proto-Danksharding, proposed in Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844 (EIP-4844), aims to incrementally improve the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain by introducing a new type of transaction known as blob-carrying transactions. These transactions incorporate binary large objects (blobs) of data that are stored off-chain but referenced and verified on-chain to ensure data availability. By decoupling data availability from transaction execution, Proto-Danksharding alleviates network congestion and reduces gas fees, laying the groundwork for future, more advanced sharding solutions. This letter provides an analytical model to derive the delay for these new transactions. We model the system as an $\mathrm{M/D}^B/1$ queue which we then find its steady state distribution through embedding a Markov chain and use of supplementary variable method. We show that transactions with more blobs but less frequent impose higher delays on the system compared to lower blobs but more frequent.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of multi-UAV uniform sweep coverage, where a homogeneous swarm of UAVs must collectively and evenly visit every portion of an unknown environment for a sampling task without having access to their own location and orientation. Random walk-based exploration strategies are practical for such a coverage scenario as they do not rely on localization and are easily implementable in robot swarms. We demonstrate that the Mergeable Nervous System (MNS) framework, which enables a robot swarm to self-organize into a hierarchical ad-hoc communication network using local communication, is a promising control approach for random exploration in unknown environments by UAV swarms. To this end, we propose an MNS-based random walk approach where UAVs self-organize into a line formation using the MNS framework and then follow a random walk strategy to cover the environment while maintaining the formation. Through simulations, we test the efficiency of our approach against several decentralized random walk-based strategies as benchmarks. Our results show that the MNS-based random walk outperforms the benchmarks in terms of the time required to achieve full coverage and the coverage uniformity at that time, assessed across both the entire environment and within local regions.

Abstract: Decompilation of binary code has arisen as a highly-important application in the space of Ethereum VM (EVM) smart contracts. Major new decompilers appear nearly every year and attain popularity, for a multitude of reverse-engineering or tool-building purposes. Technically, the problem is fundamental: it consists of recovering high-level control flow from a highly-optimized continuation-passing-style (CPS) representation. Architecturally, decompilers can be built using either static analysis or symbolic execution techniques.
  We present Shrknr, a static-analysis-based decompiler succeeding the state-of-the-art Elipmoc decompiler. Shrknr manages to achieve drastic improvements relative to the state of the art, in all significant dimensions: scalability, completeness, precision. Chief among the techniques employed is a new variant of static analysis context: shrinking context sensitivity. Shrinking context sensitivity performs deep cuts in the static analysis context, eagerly "forgetting" control-flow history, in order to leave room for further precise reasoning.
  We compare Shrnkr to state-of-the-art decompilers, both static-analysis- and symbolic-execution-based. In a standard benchmark set, Shrnkr scales to over 99.5% of contracts (compared to ~95%), covers (i.e., reaches and manages to decompile) 67% more code, and reduces key imprecision metrics by over 65%.

Abstract: Blockchain technology, which was introduced for supporting cryptocurrencies, today provides a decentralized infrastructure for general information storage and execution of algorithms, thus enabling the conversion of many applications and services from a centralized and intermediated model to a decentralized and disintermediated one. In this paper we focus on biometric authentication, which is classically performed using centralized systems, and could hence benefit from decentralization. For such a purpose, however, an inherent contradiction between biometric applications and blockchain technology must be overcome, as the former require keeping biometric features private, while blockchain is a public infrastructure. We propose a blockchain-based biometric authentication protocol that enables decentralization and resilience while protecting the privacy, personal data, and, in particular, biometric features of users. The protocol we propose leverages fuzzy commitment schemes to allow biometric authentication to be performed without disclosing biometric data. We also analyze the security of the protocol we propose by considering some relevant attacks.

Abstract: The multi-objective coverage control problem requires a robot swarm to collaboratively provide sensor coverage to multiple heterogeneous importance density fields (IDFs) simultaneously. We pose this as an optimization problem with constraints and study two different formulations: (1) Fair coverage, where we minimize the maximum coverage cost for any field, promoting equitable resource distribution among all fields; and (2) Constrained coverage, where each field must be covered below a certain cost threshold, ensuring that critical areas receive adequate coverage according to predefined importance levels. We study the decentralized setting where robots have limited communication and local sensing capabilities, making the system more realistic, scalable, and robust. Given the complexity, we propose a novel decentralized constrained learning approach that combines primal-dual optimization with a Learnable Perception-Action-Communication (LPAC) neural network architecture. We show that the Lagrangian of the dual problem can be reformulated as a linear combination of the IDFs, enabling the LPAC policy to serve as a primal solver. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method (i) significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art decentralized controllers by 30% on average in terms of coverage cost, (ii) transfers well to larger environments with more robots and (iii) is scalable in the number of fields and robots in the swarm.

Abstract: We propose a privacy-preserving billing protocol for local energy markets (PBP-LEM) that takes into account market participants' energy volume deviations from their bids. PBP-LEM enables a group of market entities to jointly compute participants' bills in a decentralized and privacy-preserving manner without sacrificing correctness. It also mitigates risks on individuals' privacy arising from any potential internal collusion. We first propose an efficient and privacy-preserving individual billing scheme, achieving information-theoretic security, which serves as a building block. PBP-LEM utilizes this scheme, along with other techniques such as multiparty computation, inner product functional encryption and Pedersen commitments to ensure data confidentiality and accuracy. Additionally, we present three approaches, resulting in different levels of privacy protection and performance. We prove that the protocol meets its security and privacy requirements and is feasible for deployment in real LEMs: bills can be computed in less than five minutes for 4,000 users using the most computationally intensive approach, and in just 0.18 seconds using the least intensive one.

Abstract: Scams -- fraudulent schemes designed to swindle money from victims -- have existed for as long as recorded history. However, the Internet's combination of low communication cost, global reach, and functional anonymity has allowed scam volumes to reach new heights. Designing effective interventions requires first understanding the context: how scammers reach potential victims, the earnings they make, and any potential bottlenecks for durable interventions. In this short paper, we focus on these questions in the context of cryptocurrency giveaway scams, where victims are tricked into irreversibly transferring funds to scammers under the pretense of even greater returns. Combining data from Twitter, YouTube and Twitch livestreams, landing pages, and cryptocurrency blockchains, we measure how giveaway scams operate at scale. We find that 1 in 1000 scam tweets, and 4 in 100,000 livestream views, net a victim, and that scammers managed to extract nearly \$4.62 million from just hundreds of victims during our measurement window.

Abstract: We present a peer-to-peer (P2P) live-streaming architecture designed to address challenges such as free-riding, malicious peers, churn, and network instability through the integration of a reputation system. The proposed algorithm incentivizes active peer participation while discouraging opportunistic behaviors, with a reputation mechanism that rewards altruistic peers and penalizes free riders and malicious actors. To manage peer dynamics, the algorithm continuously updates the strategies and adjusts to changing neighbors. It also implements a request-to-join mechanism for flash crowd scenarios, allowing the source node to delegate requests to child nodes, forming an interconnected tree structure that efficiently handles high demand and maintains system stability. The decentralized reputation mechanism promotes long-term sustainability in the P2P live streaming system.

<div> 关键词：安全、敏捷机器人、分散式控制器、输入限制、大规模扩展

总结:

本文提出了一种全新的算法，旨在为拥挤环境中的机器人部署提供安全且灵活的控制策略。该算法通过三个关键步骤实现目标：

1. **学习分散式神经积分控制障碍函数（神经ICBF）**：此步骤涉及构建一个可扩展的、针对输入受限控制设计的分散式神经网络模型，以确保在大量代理的情况下仍能有效运行。

2. **嵌入轻量级分散式模型预测控制基于积分控制障碍函数（MPC-ICBF）**：在神经网络策略中集成MPC-ICBF机制，以确保安全性的同时保持算法的可扩展性。

3. **引入基于机器学习的梯度优化技术来最小化死锁**：通过解决局部最小值问题，该方法有效减少系统中的死锁现象。

文中提供的数值模拟结果表明，该方法在安全性、输入约束满足和死锁最小化方面均优于当前最先进的多代理控制系统。此外，实验还展示了该方法在不同场景下对不同代理数量的强泛化能力，最高可达1000个代理。 <div>
arXiv:2409.09573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To deploy safe and agile robots in cluttered environments, there is a need to develop fully decentralized controllers that guarantee safety, respect actuation limits, prevent deadlocks, and scale to thousands of agents. Current approaches fall short of meeting all these goals: optimization-based methods ensure safety but lack scalability, while learning-based methods scale but do not guarantee safety. We propose a novel algorithm to achieve safe and scalable control for multiple agents under limited actuation. Specifically, our approach includes: $(i)$ learning a decentralized neural Integral Control Barrier function (neural ICBF) for scalable, input-constrained control, $(ii)$ embedding a lightweight decentralized Model Predictive Control-based Integral Control Barrier Function (MPC-ICBF) into the neural network policy to ensure safety while maintaining scalability, and $(iii)$ introducing a novel method to minimize deadlocks based on gradient-based optimization techniques from machine learning to address local minima in deadlocks. Our numerical simulations show that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art multi-agent control algorithms in terms of safety, input constraint satisfaction, and minimizing deadlocks. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization across scenarios with varying agent counts, scaling up to 1000 agents.

Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of a Federated Learning (FL) testbed, focusing on its application in cybersecurity and evaluating its resilience against poisoning attacks. Federated Learning allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model while keeping their data decentralized, addressing critical needs for data privacy and security, particularly in sensitive fields like cybersecurity. Our testbed, built using the Flower framework, facilitates experimentation with various FL frameworks, assessing their performance, scalability, and ease of integration. Through a case study on federated intrusion detection systems, we demonstrate the testbed's capabilities in detecting anomalies and securing critical infrastructure without exposing sensitive network data. Comprehensive poisoning tests, targeting both model and data integrity, evaluate the system's robustness under adversarial conditions. Our results show that while federated learning enhances data privacy and distributed learning, it remains vulnerable to poisoning attacks, which must be mitigated to ensure its reliability in real-world applications.

<div> 关键词：Coordination-free Collaborative Replication（CCR）、Distributed Systems、Data-sharing systems、Conflict-free Replicated Data Type（CRDT）、Operational Transformation（OT）

<br />
<br />总结:
文章引入了协调自由协作复制(Coordination-free Collaborative Replication, CCR)，这是一种新的分布式系统一致性维护方法，无需明确的协调消息。相比传统数据共享系统依赖中心化更新管理和预定义一致性规则，CCR自动化冲突解决，提供了一种更直观和高效的数据协作方案。

具体而言，CCR通过基于数据流汇聚的通用协议，自动处理冲突，避免了如操作转换(OT)和冲突免费复制数据类型(CRDT)等方法的复杂性和潜在问题。OT虽然保证了文档一致性，但依赖于服务器协调，不适合现代去中心化的P2P环境。而CRDT虽然确保最终一致性，但可能导致非直觉的行为，如从购物车中移除的商品无法重新添加。

相比之下，CCR允许直接更新并基于当前数据状态进行冲突解决，提高了清晰度和易用性。此外，它解决了传统方法中的消息效率问题，提供了在分布式系统中进行高效和实际协作数据共享的解决方案。 <div>
arXiv:2409.09934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Coordination-free Collaborative Replication (CCR), a new method for maintaining consistency across replicas in distributed systems without requiring explicit coordination messages. CCR automates conflict resolution, contrasting with traditional Data-sharing systems that typically involve centralized update management or predefined consistency rules.
  Operational Transformation (OT), commonly used in collaborative editing, ensures consistency by transforming operations while maintaining document integrity across replicas. However, OT assumes server-based coordination, which is unsuitable for modern, decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems.
  Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT), like Two-Phase Sets (2P-Sets), guarantees eventual consistency by allowing commutative and associative operations but often result in counterintuitive behaviors, such as failing to re-add an item to a shopping cart once removed.
  In contrast, CCR employs a more intuitive approach to replication. It allows for straightforward updates and conflict resolution based on the current data state, enhancing clarity and usability compared to CRDTs. Furthermore, CCR addresses inefficiencies in messaging by developing a versatile protocol based on data stream confluence, thus providing a more efficient and practical solution for collaborative data sharing in distributed systems.

总结:

本文探讨了在不确定通信环境下的分布式子模最大值问题，特别是当系统受到分区马尔杜姆约束时。研究引入了一个通信意识框架，其中考虑了连接设备之间成功通信的概率。这一创新使得优化过程能够更好地适应实际网络中的不确定性。

首先，文章提出了概率最优性差距的概念，这一概念强调了在资源有限的环境中，基于代理广播可靠性和策略性决策来确定消息传递序列的重要性。具体而言，它关注于如何根据代理的广播能力（包括是否允许多次广播）和其在通信链路中的可靠性来优化信息传播路径。

其次，该框架不仅提供了理论上的分析工具，还具有实践意义，可以帮助设计和评估在通信不稳定环境下的分布式系统。通过考虑通信概率，可以更精确地预测系统的性能，从而优化资源配置和提高整体效率。

最后，文章通过一个数值示例直观地展示了所提出方法的有效性，证明了在不同通信概率下，优化策略对最终结果的影响。这不仅验证了理论分析的正确性，也为实际应用提供了参考。

综上所述，本文通过构建一个通信意识框架，为解决分布式子模最大值问题提供了一种新的视角，特别关注于在不确定性通信环境下，如何通过概率性信息传递来优化系统性能，具有重要的理论价值和实践指导意义。 <div>

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of decentralized submodular maximization subject to partition matroid constraint using a sequential greedy algorithm with probabilistic inter-agent message-passing. We propose a communication-aware framework where the probability of successful communication between connected devices is considered. Our analysis introduces the notion of the probabilistic optimality gap, highlighting its potential influence on determining the message-passing sequence based on the agent's broadcast reliability and strategic decisions regarding agents that can broadcast their messages multiple times in a resource-limited environment. This work not only contributes theoretical insights but also has practical implications for designing and analyzing decentralized systems in uncertain communication environments. A numerical example demonstrates the impact of our results.

Abstract: This paper focuses on designing completely decentralized load frequency control (LFC) for multi-area power systems to achieve global optimized performance. To this end, a new concept of integrated design is introduced for designing the decentralized LFC observers and controllers simultaneously off-line, by taking into account of the interactions between areas and the bidirectional effects between the local observer and controller in each area. The integrated design in this paper is realized via $H_\infty$ optimization with a single-step linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulation. The LMI regional eigenvalue assignment technique is further incorporated with $H_\infty$ optimization to improve the closed-loop system transient performance. A three-area power system is simulated to validate the superiority of the proposed integrated design over the conventional decentralized designs.

Abstract: Taking part in surveys, experiments, and studies is often compensated by rewards to increase the number of participants and encourage attendance. While privacy requirements are usually considered for participation, privacy aspects of the reward procedure are mostly ignored. To this end, we introduce PrePaMS, an efficient participation management system that supports prerequisite checks and participation rewards in a privacy-preserving way. Our system organizes participations with potential (dis-)qualifying dependencies and enables secure reward payoffs. By leveraging a set of proven cryptographic primitives and mechanisms such as anonymous credentials and zero-knowledge proofs, participations are protected so that service providers and organizers cannot derive the identity of participants even within the reward process. In this paper, we have designed and implemented a prototype of PrePaMS to show its effectiveness and evaluated its performance under realistic workloads. PrePaMS covers the information whether subjects have participated in surveys, experiments, or studies. When combined with other secure solutions for the actual data collection within these events, PrePaMS can represent a cornerstone for more privacy-preserving empirical research.

<div> 关键词：非凸障碍物、局部最小值、多机器人导航、局部传感器信息、无图导航

<br /><br />
总结:

本文提出了解决在非凸障碍物环境下进行多机器人导航的挑战，这些环境的特点是没有完整的环境知识。传统的反应式方法如人工势场法（APF）虽然简单高效，但容易陷入局部最小值，导致机器人被困，这是因为它们缺乏全局环境意识。现有的解决方案要么依赖于机器人间的通信，要么局限于单机器人场景，或者在处理非凸障碍物时表现不佳。

为了解决这些问题，本文提出了利用仅本地传感器和状态信息进行无图导航的方法。通过将墙壁跟随（WF）行为融入APF方法中，机器人能够避免陷入局部最小值，即使在存在非凸动态障碍物（包括其他机器人）的情况下。为了实现这一目标，文章引入了两种算法用于在APF和WF之间切换：一种基于规则的系统和一种使用专家演示训练的编码器网络。实验结果表明，这种方法在复杂环境中相比现有技术实现了显著更高的成功率，突显了其克服局部最小值限制的能力。 <div>

Abstract: We tackle the challenges of decentralized multi-robot navigation in environments with nonconvex obstacles, where complete environmental knowledge is unavailable. While reactive methods like Artificial Potential Field (APF) offer simplicity and efficiency, they suffer from local minima, causing robots to become trapped due to their lack of global environmental awareness. Other existing solutions either rely on inter-robot communication, are limited to single-robot scenarios, or struggle to overcome nonconvex obstacles effectively.
  Our proposed methods enable collision-free navigation using only local sensor and state information without a map. By incorporating a wall-following (WF) behavior into the APF approach, our method allows robots to escape local minima, even in the presence of nonconvex and dynamic obstacles including other robots. We introduce two algorithms for switching between APF and WF: a rule-based system and an encoder network trained on expert demonstrations. Experimental results show that our approach achieves substantially higher success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to overcome the limitations of local minima in complex environments

总结:

本文探讨了在建筑工地上利用多智能体系统进行表面整平作业的合作模式。主要关注两个关键角色：推土机和铲车。研究提出了一种名为“去中心化和异构多智能体学习方法在建筑工地应用（DAMALCS）”的策略，旨在减少操作车辆间的预期碰撞。

DAMALCS通过设计两种专家级智能体来优化作业流程，它们能够通过一种创新的优先级分配方法，高效地实现共同目标。在这种机制下，推土机的操作优先于铲车，以确保道路畅通无阻，从而保证两台车辆的连续作业。尽管仅依赖启发式规则可能不足以应对现实世界的复杂性，但本文表明，将这些规则整合进人工智能训练过程中，能够显著提高其性能。

为了验证这一理论的有效性，研究人员在模拟环境以及真实世界实验室中对智能体进行了测试，同时考虑了视觉噪音和定位误差等变量因素。结果显示，与传统方法相比，DAMALCS策略显著降低了车辆间的碰撞率，提高了整体的工作效率和沙土处理能力。 <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration involves multiple participants working together in a shared environment to achieve a common goal. These agents share information, divide tasks, and synchronize their actions. Key aspects of multi agent collaboration include coordination, communication, task allocation, cooperation, adaptation, and decentralization. On construction sites, surface grading is the process of leveling sand piles to increase a specific area's height. In this scenario, a bulldozer grades while a dumper allocates sand piles. Our work aims to utilize a multi-agent approach to enable these vehicles to collaborate effectively. To this end, we propose a decentralized and asymmetric multi-agent learning approach for construction sites (DAMALCS). We formulate DAMALCS to reduce expected collisions for operating vehicles. Therefore, we develop two heuristic experts capable of achieving their joint goal optimally by applying an innovative prioritization method. In this approach, the bulldozer's movements take precedence over the dumper's operations, enabling the bulldozer to clear the path for the dumper and ensure continuous operation of both vehicles. Since heuristics alone are insufficient in real-world scenarios, we utilize them to train AI agents, which proves to be highly effective. We simultaneously train the bulldozer and dumper agents to operate within the same environment, aiming to avoid collisions and optimize performance in terms of time efficiency and sand volume handling. Our trained agents and heuristics are evaluated in both simulation and real-world lab experiments, testing them under various conditions, such as visual noise and localization errors. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces collision rates for these vehicles.

4. **帕累托改进**：零知识证明加密货币在流通方面优于其他工作量证明或权益证明加密货币。
5. **社会网络效应**：利用国家身份证、电子护照和eSIM固有的社交网络带来的网络效应，零知识证明加密货币主导其他支付形式。
6. **基础设施成本效益**：较低的基础设施成本意味着存在一个独特的均衡状态，其中它主导其他支付方式。

Abstract: Zero-Knowledge Proof-of-Identity from trusted public certificates (e.g., national identity cards and/or ePassports; eSIM) is introduced here to permissionless blockchains in order to remove the inefficiencies of Sybil-resistant mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work (i.e., high energy and environmental costs) and Proof-of-Stake (i.e., capital hoarding and lower transaction volume). The proposed solution effectively limits the number of mining nodes a single individual would be able to run while keeping membership open to everyone, circumventing the impossibility of full decentralization and the blockchain scalability trilemma when instantiated on a blockchain with a consensus protocol based on the cryptographic random selection of nodes. Resistance to collusion is also considered.
  Solving one of the most pressing problems in blockchains, a zk-PoI cryptocurrency is proved to have the following advantageous properties:
  - an incentive-compatible protocol for the issuing of cryptocurrency rewards based on a unique Nash equilibrium
  - strict domination of mining over all other PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies, thus the zk-PoI cryptocurrency becoming the preferred choice by miners is proved to be a Nash equilibrium and the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy
  - PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies are condemned to pay the Price of Crypto-Anarchy, redeemed by the optimal efficiency of zk-PoI as it implements the social optimum
  - the circulation of a zk-PoI cryptocurrency Pareto dominates other PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies
  - the network effects arising from the social networks inherent to national identity cards and ePassports dominate PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies
  - the lower costs of its infrastructure imply the existence of a unique equilibrium where it dominates other forms of payment

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) incidents stemming from the exploitation of smart contract vulnerabilities have culminated in financial damages exceeding 3 billion US dollars. Existing defense mechanisms typically focus on detecting and reacting to malicious transactions executed by attackers that target victim contracts. However, with the emergence of private transaction pools where transactions are sent directly to miners without first appearing in public mempools, current detection tools face significant challenges in identifying attack activities effectively.
  Based on the fact that most attack logic rely on deploying one or more intermediate smart contracts as supporting components to the exploitation of victim contracts, in this paper, we propose a new direction for detecting DeFi attacks that focuses on identifying adversarial contracts instead of adversarial transactions. Our approach allows us to leverage common attack patterns, code semantics and intrinsic characteristics found in malicious smart contracts to build the LookAhead system based on Machine Learning (ML) classifiers and a transformer model that is able to effectively distinguish adversarial contracts from benign ones, and make just-in-time predictions of potential zero-day attacks. Our contributions are three-fold: First, we construct a comprehensive dataset consisting of features extracted and constructed from recent contracts deployed on the Ethereum and BSC blockchains. Secondly, we design a condensed representation of smart contract programs called Pruned Semantic-Control Flow Tokenization (PSCFT) and use it to train a combination of ML models that understand the behaviour of malicious codes based on function calls, control flows and other pattern-conforming features. Lastly, we provide the complete implementation of LookAhead and the evaluation of its performance metrics for detecting adversarial contracts.

<div> 关键词：区块链、扩张链、EigenLayer、Aegis、安全

总结:

本文提出了一种基于主链质押的扩张链系统——Aegis。Aegis旨在利用现有的强大区块链基础设施，通过创建附加功能或独立功能的扩展链来增强原有系统的功能性与安全性。该系统的核心机制包括：

1. **使用主链质押**：节点通过向主链存入抵押品（即存款作为担保）来参与扩张链的运营。这一机制激励节点保持行为正确，因为违约将导致抵押品被削减（撤销）。

2. **参考与验证**：Aegis使用来自Aegis区块的主链区块引用来定义委员会成员，确保决策的连续性和稳定性。同时，主链上的检查点用于持续维护决策，而主链的重置则用于在先前的委员会变得过时后建立新的委员会。

3. **保证安全性与快速进展**：Aegis系统设计确保了在所有时间点的安全性，并在Aegis节点间延迟较低时实现了快速进展。

4. **应对挑战**：面对节点可能因撤回质押而不再保持正确性的挑战，Aegis通过假设主链写入时间有界，来解决新出现的难题。

综上所述，Aegis通过创新地结合主链质押与扩张链概念，为区块链技术提供了新的应用方向，旨在提升现有区块链系统的功能和安全性。 <div>

Abstract: Blockchains implement monetary systems operated by committees of nodes. The robustness of established blockchains presents an opportunity to leverage their infrastructure for creating expansion chains. Expansion chains can provide additional functionality to the primary chain they leverage or implement separate functionalities, while benefiting from the primary chain's security and the stability of its tokens. Indeed, tools like Ethereum's EigenLayer enable nodes to stake (deposit collateral) on a primary chain to form a committee responsible for operating an expansion chain.
  But here is the rub. Classical protocols assume correct, well-behaved nodes stay correct indefinitely. Yet in our case, the stake incentivizes correctness--it will be slashed (revoked) if its owner deviates. Once a node withdraws its stake, there is no basis to assume its correctness.
  To address the new challenge, we present Aegis, an expansion chain based on primary-chain stake, assuming a bounded primary-chain write time. Aegis uses references from Aegis blocks to primary blocks to define committees, checkpoints on the primary chain to perpetuate decisions, and resets on the primary chain to establish a new committee if the previous one becomes obsolete. It ensures safety at all times and rapid progress when latency among Aegis nodes is low.

总结:

本文提出了一种新颖的方法，旨在通过让智能体形成群集来生成高质量的响应。该方法利用了具备数据推断和排名能力的智能体，通过采用语言模型（LLM）作为响应分类器得以实现。研究首先评估了现有的无信任代理推断策略，随后定义了其方法论并估算实际参数，同时对不同类型的恶意代理攻击进行了建模。这种方法的优势在于它能够利用群集的集体智慧，从而在分布式AI推理中实现更加可靠、安全和高效的系统，其准确率、安全性和稳定性均有所提升。实验结果显示，相较于其他无信任的推理策略，该方法在验证延迟上快了一个数量级，仅需不到125毫秒的时间。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach where agents can form swarms to produce high-quality responses effectively. This is accomplished by utilizing agents capable of data inference and ranking, which can be effectively implemented using LLMs as response classifiers. We assess existing approaches for trustless agent inference, define our methodology, estimate practical parameters, and model various types of malicious agent attacks. Our method leverages the collective intelligence of swarms, ensuring robust and efficient decentralized AI inference with better accuracy, security, and reliability. We show that our approach is an order of magnitude faster than other trustless inference strategies reaching less than 125 ms validation latency.

Abstract: To address the challenges of internal security policy compliance and dynamic threat response in organizations, we present a novel framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and smart contracts. We propose a system that automates the enforcement of security policies, reducing manual effort and potential human error. Utilizing AI, we can analyse cyber threat intelligence rapidly, identify non-compliances and automatically adjust cyber defence mechanisms. Blockchain technology provides an immutable ledger for transparent logging of compliance actions, while smart contracts ensure uniform application of security measures. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through simulations, showing improvements in compliance enforcement rates and response times compared to traditional methods. Ultimately, our approach provides for a scalable solution for managing complex security policies, reducing costs and enhancing the efficiency while achieving compliance. Finally, we discuss practical implications and propose future research directions to further refine the system and address implementation challenges.

Abstract: This paper proposes an observer-based formation tracking control approach for multi-vehicle systems with second-order motion dynamics, assuming that vehicles' relative or global position and velocity measurements are unavailable. It is assumed that all vehicles are equipped with sensors capable of sensing the bearings relative to neighboring vehicles and only one leader vehicle has access to its global position. Each vehicle estimates its absolute position and velocity using relative bearing measurements and the estimates of neighboring vehicles received over a communication network. A distributed observer-based controller is designed, relying only on bearing and acceleration measurements.
  This work further explores the concept of the \textit{Bearing Persistently Exciting} (BPE) formation by proposing new algorithms for bearing-based localization and state estimation of second-order systems in centralized and decentralized manners. It also examines conditions on the desired formation to guarantee the exponential stability of distributed observer-based formation tracking controllers. In support of our theoretical results, some simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed observers as well as the observer-based tracking controllers.

Abstract: As 6G networks evolve towards a synergistic system of Communication, Sensing, and Computing, Radio Access Networks become more distributed, necessitating robust end-to-end authentication. We propose Blockchain-enabled Radio Access Networks, a novel decentralized RAN architecture enhancing security, privacy, and efficiency in authentication processes. BE-RAN leverages distributed ledger technology to establish trust, offering user-centric identity management, enabling mutual authentication, and facilitating on-demand point-to-point inter-network elements and UE-UE communication with accountable logging and billing service add-on for public network users, all without relying on centralized authorities. We envision a thoroughly decentralized RAN model and propose a privacy-preserving P2P communication approach that complements existing security measures while supporting the CSC paradigm. Results demonstrate BE-RAN significantly reduces communication and computation overheads, enhances privacy through decentralized identity management, and facilitates CSC integration, advancing towards more efficient and secure 6G networks.

总结:
本文探讨了保护区块链交易隐私的重要性，并介绍了四种使用椭圆曲线配对（ECPDKSAP）作为加密解决方案的隐蔽地址协议。这四种协议分别为ECPDKSAP、ECPSKSAP、Protocol 1和Protocol 2。ECPDKSAPs采用查看密钥和支出密钥的组合方式，而ECPSKSAP则使用单一密钥来生成查看和支出密钥。实验结果显示，Protocol 3（Elliptic Curve Pairing Dual Key Stealth Address Protocol）在视图标签方面表现最佳，特别适用于以太坊生态系统。

值得注意的是，ECPSKSAP虽然在速度上相对较慢，但其仅使用一个私有密钥的独特性质提供了理论上的价值。文章还对比了ECPDKSAP与传统方法（如DKSAP）的性能，表明前者在隐私保护方面具有显著优势。整体而言，这些协议旨在通过椭圆曲线配对技术提高区块链交易的匿名性和安全性，为用户提供更强大的隐私保护机制。 <div>

Abstract: Protecting the privacy of blockchain transactions is extremely important for users. Stealth address protocols (SAP) allow users to receive assets via stealth addresses that they do not associate with their stealth meta-addresses. SAP can be generated using different cryptographic approaches. DKSAP uses an elliptic curve multiplication and hashing of the resulting shared secret. Another approach is to use a elliptic curve pairing. This paper presents four SA protocols that use elliptic curve pairing as a cryptographic solution. ECPDKSAPs are pairing-based protocols that include viewing key and spending key, while ECPSKSAP is a pairing-based protocol that uses a single key with which spending and the viewing key are derived. We find that ECPDKSAPs give significantly better results than DKSAP with the view tag. The best results are achieved with Protocol 3 (Elliptic Curve Pairing Dual Key Stealth Address Protocol), which is Ethereum-friendly. ECPSKSAP is significantly slower, but it provides an interesting theoretical result as it uses only one private key.

本文提出了一种名为FedFaiREE的分布式设置下的公平学习后处理算法，专门针对小样本、分布自由的环境。该方法旨在解决联邦学习中数据分散训练带来的公平性问题，特别是在面对客户端异质性、通信成本和小样本数量的独特挑战时。FedFaiREE不仅提供了理论上的公平性和准确性保证，还在实验中得到了实证验证，证明了其在分布式系统中的有效性和实用性。

文章首先指出，随着联邦学习在实际应用中的重要性日益凸显，确保不同群体间的公平性变得至关重要。然而，现有的大多数用于保障公平性的机器学习算法设计基于集中式数据环境，并通常需要大量样本和分布假设，这与分布式、异构系统的特性不完全匹配。因此，提出了FedFaiREE这一创新解决方案。

FedFaiREE通过引入后处理算法的概念，实现了在有限样本和无分布假设条件下的公平学习。它旨在适应并克服分布式环境中常见的挑战，如客户端差异、通信开销以及样本量小等问题。理论分析和实验结果共同展示了FedFaiREE在实现公平性和保持模型性能方面的能力，验证了其在小样本、分布式学习场景中的适用性和有效性。

通过这种专门设计的方法，FedFaiREE为解决联邦学习中的公平性问题提供了一个有力的工具，不仅能够确保算法的公平性，同时还能在资源有限的环境下保持良好的性能表现。这为促进更加公平、高效的数据驱动决策过程奠定了基础。 <div>

Abstract: As federated learning gains increasing importance in real-world applications due to its capacity for decentralized data training, addressing fairness concerns across demographic groups becomes critically important. However, most existing machine learning algorithms for ensuring fairness are designed for centralized data environments and generally require large-sample and distributional assumptions, underscoring the urgent need for fairness techniques adapted for decentralized and heterogeneous systems with finite-sample and distribution-free guarantees. To address this issue, this paper introduces FedFaiREE, a post-processing algorithm developed specifically for distribution-free fair learning in decentralized settings with small samples. Our approach accounts for unique challenges in decentralized environments, such as client heterogeneity, communication costs, and small sample sizes. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for both fairness and accuracy, and our experimental results further provide robust empirical validation for our proposed method.

Abstract: Building elastic and scalable edge resources is an inevitable prerequisite for providing platform-based smart city services. Smart city services are delivered through edge computing to provide low-latency applications. However, edge computing has always faced the challenge of limited resources. A single edge device cannot undertake the various intelligent computations in a smart city, and the large-scale deployment of edge devices from different service providers to build an edge resource platform has become a necessity. Selecting computing power from different service providers is a game-theoretic problem. To incentivize service providers to actively contribute their valuable resources and provide low-latency collaborative computing power, we introduce a game-theoretic deep learning model to reach a consensus among service providers on task scheduling and resource provisioning. Traditional centralized resource management approaches are inefficient and lack credibility, while the introduction of blockchain technology can enable decentralized resource trading and scheduling. We propose a contribution-based proof mechanism to provide the low-latency service of edge computing. The deep learning model consists of dual encoders and a single decoder, where the GNN (Graph Neural Network) encoder processes structured decision action data, and the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) encoder handles time-series task scheduling data. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our model reduces latency by 584% compared to the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Ethereum faces growing fraud threats. Current fraud detection methods, whether employing graph neural networks or sequence models, fail to consider the semantic information and similarity patterns within transactions. Moreover, these approaches do not leverage the potential synergistic benefits of combining both types of models. To address these challenges, we propose TLMG4Eth that combines a transaction language model with graph-based methods to capture semantic, similarity, and structural features of transaction data in Ethereum. We first propose a transaction language model that converts numerical transaction data into meaningful transaction sentences, enabling the model to learn explicit transaction semantics. Then, we propose a transaction attribute similarity graph to learn transaction similarity information, enabling us to capture intuitive insights into transaction anomalies. Additionally, we construct an account interaction graph to capture the structural information of the account transaction network. We employ a deep multi-head attention network to fuse transaction semantic and similarity embeddings, and ultimately propose a joint training approach for the multi-head attention network and the account interaction graph to obtain the synergistic benefits of both.

本文主要探讨了联邦推荐系统（FedRec）中的隐私保护问题以及其对目标攻击的脆弱性。FedRec作为一种分布式训练模型，旨在保护用户隐私，但同时也面临来自商业和社交影响的威胁。研究发现，现有针对FedRec系统的攻击方法在实现效果上存在局限性，尤其是在联邦序列推荐（FSR）任务中。

Abstract: Federated recommendation (FedRec) preserves user privacy by enabling decentralized training of personalized models, but this architecture is inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Significant research has been conducted on targeted attacks in FedRec systems, motivated by commercial and social influence considerations. However, much of this work has largely overlooked the differential robustness of recommendation models. Moreover, our empirical findings indicate that existing targeted attack methods achieve only limited effectiveness in Federated Sequential Recommendation (FSR) tasks. Driven by these observations, we focus on investigating targeted attacks in FSR and propose a novel dualview attack framework, named DV-FSR. This attack method uniquely combines a sampling-based explicit strategy with a contrastive learning-based implicit gradient strategy to orchestrate a coordinated attack. Additionally, we introduce a specific defense mechanism tailored for targeted attacks in FSR, aiming to evaluate the mitigation effects of the attack method we proposed. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach on representative sequential models.

Abstract: Ethereum smart contracts are executable programs deployed on a blockchain. Once deployed, they cannot be updated due to their inherent immutability. Moreover, they often manage valuable assets that are worth millions of dollars, making them attractive targets for attackers. The introduction of vulnerabilities in programs due to the reuse of vulnerable code posted on Q&amp;A websites such as Stack Overflow is not a new issue. However, little effort has been made to analyze the extent of this issue on deployed smart contracts. In this paper, we conduct a study on the impact of vulnerable code reuse from Q&amp;A websites during the development of smart contracts and provide tools uniquely fit to detect vulnerable code patterns in complete and incomplete Smart Contract code. This paper proposes a pattern-based vulnerability detection tool that is able to analyze code snippets (i.e., incomplete code) as well as full smart contracts based on the concept of code property graphs. We also propose a methodology that leverages fuzzy hashing to quickly detect code clones of vulnerable snippets among deployed smart contracts. Our results show that our vulnerability search, as well as our code clone detection, are comparable to state-of-the-art while being applicable to code snippets. Our large-scale study on 18,660 code snippets reveals that 4,596 of them are vulnerable, out of which 616 can be found in 7,852 deployed smart contracts. These results highlight that the reuse of vulnerable code snippets is indeed an issue in currently deployed smart contracts.

<div> 关键词：Federated Learning、Homomorphic Encryption、Reinforcement Learning、Q-Learning、HERL

总结:
本文提出了一种名为HERL（Heterogeneous Environment Reinforced Learning）的方法，它结合了强化学习与联邦学习技术，旨在优化同态加密参数，特别是多项式模数N和系数模数q。该方法首先通过聚类分析对客户端进行分级，根据它们的计算能力和安全需求。随后，使用强化学习中的Q-learning算法动态选择最适合当前客户端层级的加密参数。

实验结果显示，HERL能够显著降低计算开销，同时保持良好的实用性和安全性水平。具体而言，其在提高模型实用性方面有17%的提升，将收敛时间缩短了高达24%，并且在增强收敛效率上提高了30%，同时保持了较低的安全风险。

通过这种方式，HERL不仅解决了同态加密在异构环境下的应用挑战，还有效平衡了隐私保护与性能优化之间的矛盾，为未来的联邦学习系统提供了更为灵活和高效的加密策略。 <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning is a well-researched approach for collaboratively training machine learning models across decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, integrating Homomorphic Encryption to ensure data confidentiality introduces significant computational and communication overheads, particularly in heterogeneous environments where clients have varying computational capacities and security needs. In this paper, we propose HERL, a Reinforcement Learning-based approach that uses Q-Learning to dynamically optimize encryption parameters, specifically the polynomial modulus degree, $N$, and the coefficient modulus, $q$, across different client tiers. Our proposed method involves first profiling and tiering clients according to the chosen clustering approach, followed by dynamically selecting the most suitable encryption parameters using an RL-agent. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the computational overhead while maintaining utility and a high level of security. Empirical results show that HERL improves utility by 17%, reduces the convergence time by up to 24%, and increases convergence efficiency by up to 30%, with minimal security loss.

Abstract: Graph path search is a classic computer science problem that has been recently approached with Reinforcement Learning (RL) due to its potential to outperform prior methods. Existing RL techniques typically assume a global view of the network, which is not suitable for large-scale, dynamic, and privacy-sensitive settings. An area of particular interest is search in social networks due to its numerous applications. Inspired by seminal work in experimental sociology, which showed that decentralized yet efficient search is possible in social networks, we frame the problem as a collaborative task between multiple agents equipped with a limited local view of the network. We propose a multi-agent approach for graph path search that successfully leverages both homophily and structural heterogeneity. Our experiments, carried out over synthetic and real-world social networks, demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms learned and heuristic baselines. Furthermore, our results show that meaningful embeddings for graph navigation can be constructed using reward-driven learning.

<div> 关键词：投票式区块链、异步网络、验证强一致性、拜占庭容错共识、线性视图变化

总结:
本文提出了一种基于验证强一致性的拜占庭容错（BFT）共识模型，旨在解决投票式区块链在异步网络环境下的局限性。通过该模型，节点可以在异步设置中使用基于领导者的协调机制进行状态机复制（SMR），同时保持与二进制拜占庭协议相同的容错能力，但无需在投票前确保诚实节点的一致性。这意味着，节点可以操作在不同的、暂时互斥的状态上，直到最终达成共识并统一到相同的状态。

为实现这一目标，文章设计了一个针对投票式区块链的异步BFT协议。该协议解决了关键挑战，包括如何确保节点在投票轮次中最终达成一致，如何保证区块链在达成共识的同时持续前进，以及如何维持强大的拜占庭容错性。此外，该协议显著降低了消息复杂度，并首次实现了不依赖阈签名的线性视图变化。

通过采用这种新型的共识模型和协议，构建的异步区块链能够以与使用如HotStuff-2等部分同步区块链相同的方式运行，简单高效地部署于大规模网络中。 <div>

Abstract: Vote-based blockchains construct a state machine replication (SMR) system among participating nodes, using Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols to transition from one state to another. Currently, they rely on either synchronous or partially synchronous networks with leader-based coordination or costly Asynchronous Common Subset (ACS) protocols in asynchronous settings, making them impractical for large-scale asynchronous applications.
  To make Asynchronous SMR scalable, this paper proposes a \emph{validated strong} BFT consensus model that allows leader-based coordination in asynchronous settings. Our BFT consensus model offers the same level of tolerance as binary byzantine agreement but does not demand consistency among honest nodes before they vote. An SMR using our model allows nodes to operate in different, tentative, but mutually exclusive states until they eventually converge on the same state. We propose an asynchronous BFT protocol for vote-based blockchains employing our consensus model to address several critical challenges: how to ensure that nodes eventually converge on the same state across voting rounds, how to assure that a blockchain will steadily progress through epochs while reaching consensus for previous epochs, and how to maintain robust byzantine fault tolerance.
  Our protocol greatly reduces message complexity and is the first one to achieve linear view changes without relying on threshold signatures. We prove that an asynchronous blockchain built on our protocol can operate with the \emph{same} simplicity and efficiency as partially synchronous blockchains built on, e.g. HotStuff-2. This facilitates deploying asynchronous blockchains across large-scale networks.

总结:
本文聚焦于非同质化代币（NFT）市场面临的挑战，尤其是由于高准入门槛和有限的市场流动性导致的市场需求下降。为解决这一问题，文章提出了一种名为“所有权分割”的创新方法，允许多个实体共同持有单一NFT的一部分，从而降低投资者的准入门槛，提高市场流动性，并使有价值的数字资产更易于大众获取。然而，当前的NFT所有权分割领域缺乏统一的标准框架，这阻碍了安全、互操作性和可访问性平台的发展。因此，该文旨在提供深入的分析，着重于所有权分割的安全挑战，并引入一个标准化解决方案，以解决这些问题并促进更安全、更兼容和更广泛的NFT所有权分割平台的建立。 <div>

Abstract: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offer a unique method for representing digital and physical assets on the blockchain. However, the NFT market has recently experienced a downturn in interest, mainly due to challenges related to high entry barriers and limited market liquidity. Fractionalization emerges as a promising solution, allowing multiple parties to hold a stake in a single NFT. By breaking down ownership into fractional shares, this approach lowers the entry barrier for investors, enhances market liquidity, and democratizes access to valuable digital assets. Despite these benefits, the current landscape of NFT fractionalization is fragmented, with no standardized framework to guide the secure and interoperable implementation of fractionalization mechanisms. This paper contributions are twofold: first, we provide a detailed analysis of the current NFT fractionalization landscape focusing on security challenges; second, we introduce a standardized approach that addresses these challenges, paving the way for more secure, interoperable, and accessible NFT fractionalization platforms.

<div> 关键词：分布式系统运营商、能源交易、用户侧分散化、能量匹配、实时功率一致性

总结:

本文提出了一种针对分布式系统运营商（DSO）的最优操作方法，该方法考虑了内部生产者与消费者之间的点对点（P2P）交易。研究假设DSO为中立财务实体，负责聚合生产者在P2P交易后的盈余能源和需求缺口，同时调度分布式能源资源并考虑网络完整性。文章探讨了P2P交易对DSO最优操作的影响。

1. 能量匹配型P2P交易影响了DSO与批发市场之间交换的能源数量，但不会改变DSO内部的调度决策。
   
2. 实时功率一致性水平不同会导致配电网总盈余的不同。
   
3. 对于实时功率匹配型P2P交易，提供的能源和总盈余不受影响，因此DSO可以安全地忽略遵循本文定义格式的P2P交易。
   
4. 案例研究表明，P2P交易不会影响整个系统的物理功率流动，而是影响DSO与生产者之间的财务分配。

5. 结论强调了P2P交易对DSO物理系统运行的独立性以及其对DSO与生产者之间财务关系的影响。 <div>

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, commonly recognized as a decentralized approach, has emerged as a popular way to better utilize distributed energy resources (DERs). In order to better manage this user-side decentralized approach from a system operator's point of view, this paper proposes an optimal operation approach for distribution system operators (DSO), comprising internal prosumers who engage in P2P transactions. The DSO is assumed to be a financial neutral entity, holding the responsibility of aggregating the surplus energy and deficit demand of prosumers after their P2P transactions while dispatching DERs and considering network integrity. Impacts of P2P transactions on DSO's optimal operation have been studied. Results indicate that energy matching P2P trading where only the total amount of energy over a given period of time is defined may affect quantities of energy exchanged between the DSO and the wholesale market, but not internal dispatch decisions of the DSO. Different levels of real-time power consistency may lead to different total surpluses in the distribution network. For the real-time power matching P2P trading, as a special case of energy matching P2P trading, the provided energy and total surplus are not affected. In other words, DSO can safely ignore P2P transactions if they follow the format defined in this paper. Case studies verify these conclusions and further demonstrate that P2P trading will not affect physical power flow of the whole system, but the financial distribution between the DSO and prosumers.

Abstract: Sharding enhances blockchain scalability by dividing the network into shards, each managing specific unspent transaction outputs or accounts. As an introduced new transaction type, cross-shard transactions pose a critical challenge to the security and efficiency of sharding blockchains. Currently, there is a lack of a generic sharding consensus pattern that achieves both security and low overhead. In this paper, we present Kronos, a secure sharding blockchain consensus achieving optimized overhead. In particular, we propose a new secure sharding consensus pattern, based on a buffer managed jointly by shard members. Valid transactions are transferred to the payee via the buffer, while invalid ones are rejected through happy or unhappy paths. Kronos is proved to achieve security with atomicity under malicious clients with optimal intra-shard overhead $kB$ ($k$ for involved shard number and $B$ for a Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) cost). Besides, we propose secure cross-shard certification methods based on batch certification and reliable cross-shard transfer. The former combines hybrid trees or vector commitments, while the latter integrates erasure coding. Handling $b$ transactions, Kronos is proved to achieve reliability with low cross-shard overhead $O(n b \lambda)$ ($n$ for shard size and $\lambda$ for the security parameter). Notably, Kronos imposes no restrictions on BFT and does not rely on time assumptions, offering optional constructions in various modules. We implement Kronos using two prominent BFT protocols: asynchronous Speeding Dumbo and partial synchronous Hotstuff. Extensive experiments demonstrate Kronos scales the consensus nodes to thousands, achieving a substantial throughput of 320 ktx/sec with 2.0 sec latency. Compared with the past solutions, Kronos outperforms, achieving up to a 12* improvement in throughput and a 50% reduction in latency.

Abstract: Immersive technologies such as Metaverse, AR, and VR are at a crossroads, with many actors pondering their adoption and potential sectors interested in integration. The cultural and tourism industries are particularly impacted, facing significant pressure to make decisions that could shape their future landscapes. Stakeholders' perceptions play a crucial role in this process, influencing the speed and extent of technology adoption. As immersive technologies promise to revolutionize experiences, stakeholders in these fields weigh the benefits and challenges of embracing such innovations. The current choices will likely determine the trajectory of cultural preservation and tourism enhancement, potentially transforming how we engage with history, art, and travel. Starting from a decomposition of stakeholders' perceptions into principal components using Q-methodology, this article employs an evolutionary game model to attempt to map possible scenarios and highlight potential decision-making trajectories. The proposed approach highlights how evolutionary dynamics lead to identifying a dominant long-term strategy that emerges from the complex system of coexistence among various stakeholders.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for eigenvalue computation using a distributed cooperative neural network framework. Unlike traditional techniques that struggle with scalability in large systems, our decentralized algorithm enables multiple autonomous agents to collaboratively estimate the smallest eigenvalue of large matrices. Each agent uses a localized neural network model, refining its estimates through inter-agent communication. Our approach guarantees convergence to the true eigenvalue, even with communication failures or network disruptions. Theoretical analysis confirms the robustness and accuracy of the method, while empirical results demonstrate its better performance compared to some traditional centralized algorithms

Abstract: Heralded entanglement generation between nodes of a future quantum internet is a fundamental operation that unlocks the potential for quantum communication. In this paper, we propose a decentralized synchronization protocol that operates at the classical control-plane of the link layer, to navigate the coordination challenges of generating heralded entanglement across few-qubit quantum network nodes. Additionally, with quantum network simulations using NetSquid, we show that our protocol achieves lower entanglement request latencies than a naive distributed queue approach. We observe a sixfold reduction in average request latency growth as the number of quantum network links increases. The Eventual Synchronization Protocol (ESP) allows nodes to coordinate on heralded entanglement generation in a scalable manner within multi-peer quantum networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decentralized synchronization protocol for managing heralded entanglement requests.

Abstract: Conditional thank-you gifts are one of the most widely used incentives for charitable giving. Past studies explored non-monetary thank-you gifts (e.g., mugs and shirts) and monetary thank-you gifts (e.g., rebates that return some of the donations to the giver). Following the rapid growth of blockchain technology, a novel form of thank-you gifts emerged: the crypto rewards. Through two studies, we analyze crypto thank-you gifts to shed light on fundraising designs in the digital world. In Study I, we examine the Ukrainian government's crypto fundraising plea that accepts donations in both Ethereum and Bitcoin. We find that Ethereum is substantially more effective in enticing giving than Bitcoin, as the hourly donation count increased 706.07% more for Ethereum than for Bitcoin when crypto rewards are present. This is likely because the crypto rewards are more likely to be issued on Ethereum than Bitcoin. However, the decrease in contribution sizes is also more substantial in Ethereum than in Bitcoin in response to the crypto rewards. In Study II, we conducted a laboratory experiment following a dictator game design to investigate the impact of crypto rewards in a more general scenario, with the crypto rewards specified as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The crypto rewards in Study II carry no monetary value but only serve to recognize donors symbolically. As such, the NFT thank-you gifts did not effectively induce people to donate; a traditional 1:1 donation matching strictly outperforms both the condition without thank-you gifts and the condition with NFT thank-you gifts. Nevertheless, the NFT thank-you gifts effectively increased the contribution sizes, conditional on the choice to give, when the NFT's graphic design primes donor identity and encompasses the charity recipient.

<div> 关键词：Decentralized Gradient Tracking（DGT）、Decentralized Gradient Descent（DGD）、Local Updates、Communication Complexity、Second-Order Heterogeneity

总结:

本文重新审视了在多轮本地更新情况下分布式优化方法中的两种基本技术：Decentralized Gradient Tracking（DGT）与Decentralized Gradient Descent（DGD）。研究主要集中在两个方面：

1. **通信复杂性与本地更新数量的关系**：文章通过理论分析证明，增加本地更新的数量（即K > 1），可以在保持一定网络连通性和降低数据异构性的情况下，有效减少通信复杂性。具体来说，对于μ强凸和L光滑的损失函数，DGT的通信复杂性为$\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \Big(\frac{L}{\mu K} + \frac{\delta}{\mu (1 - \rho)} + \frac{\rho }{(1 - \rho)^2} \cdot \frac{L+ \delta}{\mu}\Big)$，其中ρ衡量网络连通性，δ衡量局部损失的第二阶异构性。

2. **过参数化情况下的DGD**：在局部损失具有相同最小值的过参数化场景中，即使DGD不进行梯度校正，引入本地更新也能达到与DGT相似的效果，从而进一步减少通信复杂性。

3. **理论结果的验证**：通过数值实验，文章验证了其理论分析的正确性，展示了在低数据异构性和良好网络连通性的条件下，增加本地更新次数可以显著降低通信成本。

4. **理论与应用的结合**：研究不仅提供了理论上的深入理解，还指出了在实际应用中如何更有效地利用分布式优化方法，特别是在考虑通信成本和数据分布特性时。

5. **潜在影响与未来方向**：通过揭示通信与计算之间的权衡关系，该研究为设计更高效、更具适应性的分布式学习算法提供了理论基础，未来可能在大数据处理、机器学习等领域有广泛的应用前景。 <div>

Specifically, for $\mu$-strongly convex and $L$-smooth loss functions, we proved that local DGT achieves communication complexity $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \Big(\frac{L}{\mu K} + \frac{\delta}{\mu (1 - \rho)} + \frac{\rho }{(1 - \rho)^2} \cdot \frac{L+ \delta}{\mu}\Big)$, where $\rho$ measures the network connectivity and $\delta$ measures the second-order heterogeneity of the local loss. Our result reveals the tradeoff between communication and computation and shows increasing $K$ can effectively reduce communication costs when the data heterogeneity is low and the network is well-connected. We then consider the over-parameterization regime where the local losses share the same minimums, we proved that employing local updates in DGD, even without gradient correction, can yield a similar effect as DGT in reducing communication complexity. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results.

<div> 关键词：智能合约、攻击预执行、攻击反向执行、资产保护、程序修复

总结:
本文揭示了智能合约漏洞导致的巨额经济损失问题。研究人员提出了防御性措施，旨在通过在恶意交易前插入“白帽”交易来预防攻击，从而保护资产安全。然而，作者发现现有的防御手段在实际场景中已失效，141起真实世界中的攻击案例成功绕过了最先进的防御技术。

为解决这一问题，文章提出了一种创新方法，包括预执行劫持和攻击反向执行。该方法通过将攻击利用应用到攻击前后相似或相同的合同上，以保护资产。作者将这种适应攻击的技术视为一种程序修复问题，并运用现有技术构建了一个名为BACKRUNNER的完整框架。在对2023年历史攻击的测试中，BACKRUNNER成功拯救了超过4.1亿美元的资产。而在现实世界中，它仅在两个月内就帮助拯救了价值超过1120万美元的资产，涉及28起独立事件。

这种方法不仅展示了对现有防御机制的突破，还提供了有效的资产保护策略，通过预执行和反向执行机制，有效地防止和应对智能合约攻击。 <div>

Abstract: Billions of dollars have been lost due to vulnerabilities in smart contracts. To counteract this, researchers have proposed attack frontrunning protections designed to preempt malicious transactions by inserting "whitehat" transactions ahead of them to protect the assets. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing frontrunning protections have become ineffective in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we collected 158 recent real-world attack transactions and discovered that 141 of them can bypass state-of-the-art frontrunning protections. We systematically analyze these attacks and show how inherent limitations of existing frontrunning techniques hinder them from protecting valuable assets in the real world. We then propose a new approach involving 1) preemptive hijack, and 2) attack backrunning, which circumvent the existing limitations and can help protect assets before and after an attack. Our approach adapts the exploit used in the attack to the same or similar contracts before and after the attack to safeguard the assets. We conceptualize adapting exploits as a program repair problem and apply established techniques to implement our approach into a full-fledged framework, BACKRUNNER. Running on previous attacks in 2023, BACKRUNNER can successfully rescue more than \$410M. In the real world, it has helped rescue over \$11.2M worth of assets in 28 separate incidents within two months.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in numerous real-world applications. Unfortunately, fine-tuning these models at scale, especially in federated settings where data privacy and communication efficiency are critical, presents significant challenges. Existing methods often resort to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to mitigate communication overhead, but this typically comes at the cost of model accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose federated full-parameter tuning at scale for LLMs (Ferret), the first first-order method with shared randomness to enable scalable full-parameter tuning of LLMs across decentralized data sources while maintaining competitive model accuracy. Ferret accomplishes this through three aspects: (1) it employs widely applied first-order methods for efficient local updates; (2) it projects these updates into a low-dimensional space to considerably reduce communication overhead; and (3) it reconstructs local updates from this low-dimensional space with shared randomness to facilitate effective full-parameter global aggregation, ensuring fast convergence and competitive final performance. Our rigorous theoretical analyses and insights along with extensive experiments, show that Ferret significantly enhances the scalability of existing federated full-parameter tuning approaches by achieving high computational efficiency, reduced communication overhead, and fast convergence, all while maintaining competitive model accuracy. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/allen4747/Ferret.

Abstract: As particle accelerators grow in complexity, traditional control methods face increasing challenges in achieving optimal performance. This paper envisions a paradigm shift: a decentralized multi-agent framework for accelerator control, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and distributed among autonomous agents. We present a proposition of a self-improving decentralized system where intelligent agents handle high-level tasks and communication and each agent is specialized control individual accelerator components.
  This approach raises some questions: What are the future applications of AI in particle accelerators? How can we implement an autonomous complex system such as a particle accelerator where agents gradually improve through experience and human feedback? What are the implications of integrating a human-in-the-loop component for labeling operational data and providing expert guidance? We show two examples, where we demonstrate viability of such architecture.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning method that enables participants to collaboratively train a model without sharing their private data. Despite its privacy and scalability benefits, FL is susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison the local training data of a subset of clients using a backdoor trigger, aiming to make the aggregated model produce malicious results when the same backdoor condition is met by an inference-time input. Existing backdoor attacks in FL suffer from common deficiencies: fixed trigger patterns and reliance on the assistance of model poisoning. State-of-the-art defenses based on analyzing clients' model updates exhibit a good defense performance on these attacks because of the significant divergence between malicious and benign client model updates. To effectively conceal malicious model updates among benign ones, we propose DPOT, a backdoor attack strategy in FL that dynamically constructs backdoor objectives by optimizing a backdoor trigger, making backdoor data have minimal effect on model updates. We provide theoretical justifications for DPOT's attacking principle and display experimental results showing that DPOT, via only a data-poisoning attack, effectively undermines state-of-the-art defenses and outperforms existing backdoor attack techniques on various datasets.

Abstract: IoT edge computing positions computing resources closer to the data sources to reduce the latency, relieve the bandwidth pressure on the cloud, and enhance data security. Nevertheless, data security in IoT edge computing still faces critical threats (e.g., data breaches). Access control is fundamental for mitigating these threats. However, IoT edge computing introduces notable challenges for achieving resource-conserving, low-latency, flexible, and scalable access control. To review recent access control measures, we novelly organize them according to different data lifecycles--data collection, storage, and usage--and, meanwhile, review blockchain technology in this novel organization. In this way, we provide novel insights and envisage several potential research directions. This survey can help readers find gaps systematically and prompt the development of access control techniques in IoT edge computing under the intricacy of innovations in access control.

总结:
文章主要探讨了针对Smart合同的脆弱性检测问题。作者指出，目前流行的混合动态分析方法，如基于约束的执行辅助模糊测试和基于基础模型的辅助模糊测试，在实际基准测试中显示出了初步的潜力，但仍然面临低可扩展性的问题，尤其是对于复杂代码模式中的深层bug。研究发现，现有动态分析的性能瓶颈和基础模型的幻觉是限制这种混合方法扩展性的两个主要因素。

为了克服这些挑战，作者设计了一种交互式、自我决定的基础模型支持系统——SmartSys，以支持Smart合同的混合动态分析。SmartSys通过教授基础模型不同动态分析技术的性能瓶颈，使其能够预测最适合的技术并生成有效的模糊目标，这些目标能够触及到深层、隐藏的bug。此外，系统利用动态分析期间的编译反馈和运行时反馈来过滤掉错误的模糊目标。

研究结果表明，SmartSys成功地发现了逃过11个工具和多次审计超过一年的Smart合同协议漏洞，并在真实世界基准测试中将覆盖率提高了14.3%相比基线。这证明了SmartSys在提高Smart合同安全性方面的有效性和潜力。 <div>

Abstract: Smart contracts are susceptible to critical vulnerabilities. Hybrid dynamic analyses, such as concolic execution assisted fuzzing and foundation model assisted fuzzing, have emerged as highly effective testing techniques for smart contract bug detection recently. This hybrid approach has shown initial promise in real-world benchmarks, but it still suffers from low scalability to find deep bugs buried in complex code patterns. We observe that performance bottlenecks of existing dynamic analyses and model hallucination are two main factors limiting the scalability of this hybrid approach in finding deep bugs.
  To overcome the challenges, we design an interactive, self-deciding foundation model based system, called SmartSys, to support hybrid smart contract dynamic analyses. The key idea is to teach foundation models about performance bottlenecks of different dynamic analysis techniques, making it possible to forecast the right technique and generates effective fuzz targets that can reach deep, hidden bugs. To prune hallucinated, incorrect fuzz targets, SmartSys feeds foundation models with feedback from dynamic analysis during compilation and at runtime.
  The interesting results of SmartSys include: i) discovering a smart contract protocol vulnerability that has escaped eleven tools and survived multiple audits for over a year; ii) improving coverage by up to 14.3\% on real-world benchmarks compared to the baselines.

总结:

本文研究了一种用于设计一般和动态社会系统中具有异质效用的代理之间的分布式学习算法的新框架。主要贡献包括：

1. **提出Markov近势函数（MNPF）**：为了解决设计能够收敛到精确纳什均衡的分布式算法的困难，作者引入了MNPF这一概念。MNPF在确保算法收敛至近似纳什均衡方面扮演着核心角色。

2. **利用双时间尺度方法**：通过快速更新Q函数估计并慢速更新策略，该方法加速了算法的收敛过程。这种方法确保了系统的长期稳定性和收敛性。

3. **证明收敛性**：文章证明了基于演员-评论家架构的分布式学习算法在长期运行中会收敛到MNPF定义的近似纳什均衡集合。如果纳什均衡集有限，则此收敛性更加强大。

4. **理论与实际应用结合**：研究不仅提供了理论分析，还为多代理系统中的分布式学习算法的设计与实现提供了新的视角，有助于解决现实世界中的复杂交互问题。

5. **扩展游戏类型**：该工作特别关注于一般和混合性的马尔科夫游戏，这比传统的零和或潜力游戏更具挑战性，因为它们既不是完全竞争也不是完全合作的。

Abstract: The Markov game framework is widely used to model interactions among agents with heterogeneous utilities in dynamic and uncertain societal-scale systems. In these systems, agents typically operate in a decentralized manner due to privacy and scalability concerns, often acting without any information about other agents. The design and analysis of decentralized learning algorithms that provably converge to rational outcomes remain elusive, especially beyond Markov zero-sum games and Markov potential games, which do not adequately capture the nature of many real-world interactions that is neither fully competitive nor fully cooperative. This paper investigates the design of decentralized learning algorithms for general-sum Markov games, aiming to provide provable guarantees of convergence to approximate Nash equilibria in the long run. Our approach builds on constructing a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF) to address the intractability of designing algorithms that converge to exact Nash equilibria. We demonstrate that MNPFs play a central role in ensuring the convergence of an actor-critic-based decentralized learning algorithm to approximate Nash equilibria. By leveraging a two-timescale approach, where Q-function estimates are updated faster than policy updates, we show that the system converges to a level set of the MNPF over the set of approximate Nash equilibria. This convergence result is further strengthened if the set of Nash equilibria is assumed to be finite. Our findings provide a new perspective on the analysis and design of decentralized learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Matching algorithms have demonstrated great success in several practical applications, but they often require centralized coordination and plentiful information. In many modern online marketplaces, agents must independently seek out and match with another using little to no information. For these kinds of settings, can we design decentralized, limited-information matching algorithms that preserve the desirable properties of standard centralized techniques? In this work, we constructively answer this question in the affirmative. We model a two-sided matching market as a game consisting of two disjoint sets of agents, referred to as proposers and acceptors, each of whom seeks to match with their most preferable partner on the opposite side of the market. However, each proposer has no knowledge of their own preferences, so they must learn their preferences while forming matches in the market. We present a simple online learning rule that guarantees a strong notion of probabilistic convergence to the welfare-maximizing equilibrium of the game, referred to as the proposer-optimal stable match. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first completely decoupled, communication-free algorithm that guarantees probabilistic convergence to an optimal stable match, irrespective of the structure of the matching market.

Abstract: Pulsed light sources are a critical component of modern lithography, with fine light beam wavelength control paramount for wafer etching accuracy. We study optimal wavelength control by casting it as a decentralized linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) problem in presence of time-delays. In particular, we consider the multi-optics module (optics and actuators) used for generating the requisite wavelength in light sources as cooperatively interacting systems defined over a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We show that any measurement and other continuous time-delays can be exactly compensated, and the resulting optimal controller implementation at the individual optics-level outperforms any existing wavelength control techniques.

CONNECTOR首先通过从桥接合约的交易轨迹中提取独特的和通用的特征来识别存款交易。利用准确的存款交易，CONNECTOR进一步挖掘桥接合约的执行日志以实现提款交易匹配。通过在不同类型的桥梁上进行实际世界实验，证明了CONNECTOR的有效性。实验结果表明，CONNECTOR成功识别了100%的存款交易，关联了95.81%的提款交易，并在传统金融（CeFi）桥梁方法中表现出超越。基于关联结果，文章揭示了DeFi桥应用中的跨链交易行为，并分析了CONNECTOR的追踪能力，为DeFi桥应用提供辅助。 <div>

Abstract: Decentralized bridge applications are important software that connects various blockchains and facilitates cross-chain asset transfer in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem which currently operates in a multi-chain environment. Cross-chain transaction association identifies and matches unique transactions executed by bridge DApps, which is important research to enhance the traceability of cross-chain bridge DApps. However, existing methods rely entirely on unobservable internal ledgers or APIs, violating the open and decentralized properties of blockchain. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of this issue and then present CONNECTOR, an automated cross-chain transaction association analysis method based on bridge smart contracts. Specifically, CONNECTOR first identifies deposit transactions by extracting distinctive and generic features from the transaction traces of bridge contracts. With the accurate deposit transactions, CONNECTOR mines the execution logs of bridge contracts to achieve withdrawal transaction matching. We conduct real-world experiments on different types of bridges to demonstrate the effectiveness of CONNECTOR. The experiment demonstrates that CONNECTOR successfully identifies 100% deposit transactions, associates 95.81% withdrawal transactions, and surpasses methods for CeFi bridges. Based on the association results, we obtain interesting findings about cross-chain transaction behaviors in DeFi bridges and analyze the tracing abilities of CONNECTOR to assist the DeFi bridge apps.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Collaborative Cyberattack Detection (CCD) system aimed at enhancing the security of blockchain-based data-sharing networks by addressing the complex challenges associated with noise addition in federated learning models. Leveraging the theoretical principles of differential privacy, our approach strategically integrates noise into trained sub-models before reconstructing the global model through transmission. We systematically explore the effects of various noise types, i.e., Gaussian, Laplace, and Moment Accountant, on key performance metrics, including attack detection accuracy, deep learning model convergence time, and the overall runtime of global model generation. Our findings reveal the intricate trade-offs between ensuring data privacy and maintaining system performance, offering valuable insights into optimizing these parameters for diverse CCD environments. Through extensive simulations, we provide actionable recommendations for achieving an optimal balance between data protection and system efficiency, contributing to the advancement of secure and reliable blockchain networks.

总结:

本文探讨了分布式设备上机器学习任务中分散式联邦学习(DFL)的关键网络挑战。DFL通过去中心化的通信方式避免了集中式联邦学习中的单点故障问题，被认为是具有吸引力的解决方案。然而，现有的研究主要集中在DFL的拓扑结构上，而缺乏实现去中心化构建和维护网络的协议。

为解决这一问题，作者提出了一种名为FedLay的去中心化网络解决方案。FedLay旨在提供快速训练和低通信成本，以实现实际应用中的高效DFL。其独特之处在于能够以去中心化的方式构建接近随机规则的拓扑结构，并在节点加入和失败的情况下维持拓扑。

实验结果表明，基于原型实现和模拟的测试显示，FedLay在真实数据集上的模型收敛速度最快，准确度最高，同时通信成本较低，并具备对节点加入和失败的鲁棒性。这一成果填补了现有DFL拓扑结构在构建和维护协议方面的空白，为DFL的实用性和效率提供了重要支持。 <div>

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) uses peer-to-peer communication to avoid the single point of failure problem in federated learning and has been considered an attractive solution for machine learning tasks on distributed devices. We provide the first solution to a fundamental network problem of DFL: what overlay network should DFL use to achieve fast training of highly accurate models, low communication, and decentralized construction and maintenance? Overlay topologies of DFL have been investigated, but no existing DFL topology includes decentralized protocols for network construction and topology maintenance. Without these protocols, DFL cannot run in practice. This work presents an overlay network, called FedLay, which provides fast training and low communication cost for practical DFL. FedLay is the first solution for constructing near-random regular topologies in a decentralized manner and maintaining the topologies under node joins and failures. Experiments based on prototype implementation and simulations show that FedLay achieves the fastest model convergence and highest accuracy on real datasets compared to existing DFL solutions while incurring small communication costs and being resilient to node joins and failures.

<div> 关键词：Federated Learning、FedAvg、Personalized FL、Diffusion Model、pFedGPA

总结:

本文提出了一种名为pFedGPA的个性化联邦学习框架，旨在解决联邦学习中参数聚合问题。传统的联邦学习方法如FedAvg通常通过线性聚合参数，这在处理异构数据分布时可能会忽略参数空间的复杂性和高维性，从而影响模型性能。而个人化联邦学习虽然能在一定程度上缓解这一问题，但线性聚合的问题仍未得到解决。

pFedGPA利用生成模型的思路，通过在服务器端部署扩散模型来整合各客户端的参数分布，并引入了一个参数反转方法。该方法将上传的参数转换为潜在代码，然后通过去噪采样进行聚合，生成最终的个性化参数。通过使用具有高容量的扩散模型编码客户端模型参数对特定数据分布的依赖性，pFedGPA能够有效地分解所有客户端模型参数分布的整体复杂性与每个个体客户端参数分布的复杂性。

实验结果表明，pFedGPA在多个数据集上的表现均优于基线方法，证明了其在提升联邦学习性能方面的有效性和潜力。 <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized approach to model training, where data remains local and only model parameters are shared between the clients and the central server. Traditional methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), linearly aggregate these parameters which are usually trained on heterogeneous data distributions, potentially overlooking the complex, high-dimensional nature of the parameter space. This can result in degraded performance of the aggregated model. While personalized FL approaches can mitigate the heterogeneous data issue to some extent, the limitation of linear aggregation remains unresolved. To alleviate this issue, we investigate the generative approach of diffusion model and propose a novel generative parameter aggregation framework for personalized FL, \texttt{pFedGPA}. In this framework, we deploy a diffusion model on the server to integrate the diverse parameter distributions and propose a parameter inversion method to efficiently generate a set of personalized parameters for each client. This inversion method transforms the uploaded parameters into a latent code, which is then aggregated through denoising sampling to produce the final personalized parameters. By encoding the dependence of a client's model parameters on the specific data distribution using the high-capacity diffusion model, \texttt{pFedGPA} can effectively decouple the complexity of the overall distribution of all clients' model parameters from the complexity of each individual client's parameter distribution. Our experimental results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method across multiple datasets, surpassing baseline approaches.

Abstract: The development of autonomous vehicles has shown great potential to enhance the efficiency and safety of transportation systems. However, the decision-making issue in complex human-machine mixed traffic scenarios, such as unsignalized intersections, remains a challenge for autonomous vehicles. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been used to solve complex decision-making problems, existing RL methods still have limitations in dealing with cooperative decision-making of multiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), ensuring safety during exploration, and simulating realistic human driver behaviors. In this paper, a novel and efficient algorithm, Multi-Agent Game-prior Attention Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MA-GA-DDPG), is proposed to address these limitations. Our proposed algorithm formulates the decision-making problem of CAVs at unsignalized intersections as a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning problem and incorporates an attention mechanism to capture interaction dependencies between ego CAV and other agents. The attention weights between the ego vehicle and other agents are then used to screen interaction objects and obtain prior hierarchical game relations, based on which a safety inspector module is designed to improve the traffic safety. Furthermore, both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments were conducted, demonstrating that our method outperforms other baseline approaches in terms of driving safety, efficiency, and comfort.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the decentralized optimization problems with generalized orthogonality constraints, where both the objective function and the constraint exhibit a distributed structure. Such optimization problems, albeit ubiquitous in practical applications, remain unsolvable by existing algorithms in the presence of distributed constraints. To address this issue, we convert the original problem into an unconstrained penalty model by resorting to the recently proposed constraint-dissolving operator. However, this transformation compromises the essential property of separability in the resulting penalty function, rendering it impossible to employ existing algorithms to solve. We overcome this difficulty by introducing a novel algorithm that tracks the gradient of the objective function and the Jacobian of the constraint mapping simultaneously. The global convergence guarantee is rigorously established with an iteration complexity. To substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm, we present numerical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Bitcoin and many other similar Cryptocurrencies have been in existence for over a decade, prominently focusing on decentralized, pseudo-anonymous ledger-based transactions. Many protocol improvements and changes have resulted in new variants of Cryptocurrencies that are known for their peculiar characteristics. For instance, Storjcoin is a Proof-of-Storage-based Cryptocurrency that incentivizes its peers based on the amount of storage owned by them. Cryptocurrencies like Monero strive for user privacy by using privacy-centric cryptographic algorithms. While Cryptocurrencies strive to maintain peer transparency by making the transactions and the entire ledger public, user privacy is compromised at times. Monero and many other privacy-centric Cryptocurrencies have significantly improved from the original Bitcoin protocol after several problems were found in the protocol. Most of these deficiencies were related to the privacy of users. Even though Bitcoin claims to have pseudo-anonymous user identities, many attacks have managed to successfully de-anonymize users. In this paper, we present some well-known attacks and analysis techniques that have compromised the privacy of Bitcoin and many other similar Cryptocurrencies. We also analyze and study different privacy-preserving algorithms and the problems these algorithms manage to solve. Lastly, we touch upon the ethics, impact, legality, and acceptance of imposing these privacy algorithms.

总结:本文提出了一种新颖的游戏理论框架——“编码游戏”，用于探索在分布式系统中，特别是在区块链相关应用中，编码技术如何在信任不足的情况下，通过博弈论的方法优化编码策略以实现更高效的数据保护与恢复。文章首先指出了传统编码理论对节点数量的假设在现实世界中的局限性，尤其是在区块链等去中心化平台中，这种假设往往不成立。接着，文章引入了编码游戏中敌手和数据收集者（解码器）之间的互动，其中敌手在数据可恢复给数据收集者时受益，并且偏好于提高数据恢复的错误率，以此来最大化自己的收益。

文章的主要贡献在于，对于重复编码（repetition code）和特定类别的效用函数，研究并确定了编码游戏的均衡状态。这为理解在敌手和数据收集者之间的博弈关系下，如何设计有效的编码策略提供了一个基础模型。该模型不仅考虑了数据完整性和恢复效率，还考虑了参与方的激励机制，旨在找到最优策略以平衡数据安全与效率。此外，这一研究为未来在分布式系统中进一步发展更为复杂的编码策略提供了理论基础，有望在区块链等领域实现更安全、更高效的数字资产管理和数据存储解决方案。 <div>

Abstract: Coding theory revolves around the incorporation of redundancy into transmitted symbols, computation tasks, and stored data to guard against adversarial manipulation. However, error correction in coding theory is contingent upon a strict trust assumption. In the context of computation and storage, it is required that honest nodes outnumber adversarial ones by a certain margin. However, in several emerging real-world cases, particularly, in decentralized blockchain-oriented applications, such assumptions are often unrealistic. Consequently, despite the important role of coding in addressing significant challenges within decentralized systems, its applications become constrained. Still, in decentralized platforms, a distinctive characteristic emerges, offering new avenues for secure coding beyond the constraints of conventional methods. In these scenarios, the adversary benefits when the legitimate decoder recovers the data, and preferably with a high estimation error. This incentive motivates them to act rationally, trying to maximize their gains. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic formulation for coding, called the game of coding, that captures this unique dynamic where each of the adversaries and the data collector (decoder) have respective utility functions to optimize. The utility functions reflect the fact that both the data collector and the adversary are interested in increasing the chance of data being recoverable by the data collector. Moreover, the utility functions express the interest of the data collector to estimate the input with lower estimation error, but the opposite interest of the adversary. As a first, still highly non-trivial step, we characterize the equilibrium of the game for the repetition code with a repetition factor of 2 for a wide class of utility functions with minimal assumptions.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel fleet management strategy for battery-powered robot fleets tasked with intra-factory logistics in an autonomous manufacturing facility. In this environment, repetitive material handling operations are subject to real-world uncertainties such as blocked passages, and equipment or robot malfunctions. In such cases, centralized approaches enhance resilience by immediately adjusting the task allocation between the robots. To overcome the computational expense, a two-step methodology is proposed where the nominal problem is solved a priori using a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for task allocation, resulting in a nominal search tree. When a disruption occurs, the nominal search tree is rapidly updated a posteriori with costs to the new problem while simultaneously generating feasible solutions. Computational experiments prove the real-time capability of the proposed algorithm for various scenarios and compare it with the case where the search tree is not used and the decentralized approach that does not attempt task reassignment.

总结:

本文通过实证研究了以太坊区块链中分散性最低的部分——区块构建市场。区块构建市场旨在公平分配最大可提取价值（MEV）并避免验证者集中化。然而，当前数据显示，仅有三个构建者主导了大部分区块生成，集中度超过80%，这一现象引发了对集中化的担忧。尽管社区认为这种集中不会导致验证者集中化，但研究挑战了这一观点。

主要发现表明，区块构建者的集中导致了验证者的利益损失，并可能进一步促进验证者的集中化。此外，旨在缓解MEV问题的即将实施解决方案也会受到影响，因为它们依赖于区块构建市场作为MEV的参考，而市场因集中化而失真。

研究揭示了区块构建者集中化的两个主要原因，并提出了一种对现有MEV供应链的结构改变和基于新结构的解决方案。然而，长期可持续性分析仍是一个开放课题，需要未来的研究来探讨新供应链结构是否能持续稳定。 <div>

Abstract: Blockchains protect an ecosystem worth more than $500bn with strong security properties derived from the principle of decentralization. Is today's blockchain decentralized? In this paper, we empirically studied one of the least decentralized parts of Ethereum, its builder market.
  The builder market was introduced to fairly distribute Maximal Extractable Values (MEV) among validators and avoid validator centralization. As of the time of writing, three builders produced the vast majority (more than 80%) of blocks in Ethereum, creating a concerning centralization factor. However, the community believes that such centralization is okay, arguing that builder centralization will not lead to validator centralization. In this empirical study, we interrogate the causes and implications of builder centralization and challenge this belief that it is acceptable.
  Our main finding is that builder centralization has led to a significant loss by validators and, if left uncontrolled, could lead to validator centralization. Moreover, MEV mitigation solutions slated for adoption are affected too because they rely on the builder market as an MEV oracle, which is made inaccurate by centralization.
  Our investigation revealed two reasons behind builder centralization. We propose a structural change to the existing MEV supply chain and a solution based on the new supply chain structure. However, future work is required to analyze if the new supply chain structure is sustainable in the long term, which we leave open.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of energy sharing between a population of price-taking agents who adopt decentralized primal-dual gradient dynamics to find the Competitive Equilibrium (CE). Although the CE is efficient, it does not ensure fairness and can potentially lead to high prices. As the agents and market operator share a social responsibility to keep the price below a certain socially acceptable threshold, we propose an approach where the agents modify their utility functions in a decentralized way. We introduce a dynamic feedback controller for the primal-dual dynamics to steer the agents to a Socially acceptable Competitive Equilibrium (SCE). We demonstrate our theoretical findings in a case study.

Abstract: Swarm robotics explores the coordination of multiple robots to achieve collective goals, with collective decision-making being a central focus. This process involves decentralized robots autonomously making local decisions and communicating them, which influences the overall emergent behavior. Testing such decentralized algorithms in real-world scenarios with hundreds or more robots is often impractical, underscoring the need for effective simulation tools. We propose SPACE (Swarm Planning and Control Evaluation), a Python-based simulator designed to support the research, evaluation, and comparison of decentralized Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) algorithms. SPACE streamlines core algorithmic development by allowing users to implement decision-making algorithms as Python plug-ins, easily construct agent behavior trees via an intuitive GUI, and leverage built-in support for inter-agent communication and local task awareness. To demonstrate its practical utility, we implement and evaluate CBBA and GRAPE within the simulator, comparing their performance across different metrics, particularly in scenarios with dynamically introduced tasks. This evaluation shows the usefulness of SPACE in conducting rigorous and standardized comparisons of MRTA algorithms, helping to support future research in the field.

Abstract: Many blockchain networks aim to preserve the anonymity of validators in the peer-to-peer (P2P) network, ensuring that no adversary can link a validator's identifier to the IP address of a peer due to associated privacy and security concerns. This work demonstrates that the Ethereum P2P network does not offer this anonymity. We present a methodology that enables any node in the network to identify validators hosted on connected peers and empirically verify the feasibility of our proposed method. Using data collected from four nodes over three days, we locate more than 15% of Ethereum validators in the P2P network. The insights gained from our deanonymization technique provide valuable information on the distribution of validators across peers, their geographic locations, and hosting organizations. We further discuss the implications and risks associated with the lack of anonymity in the P2P network and propose methods to help validators protect their privacy. The Ethereum Foundation has awarded us a bug bounty, acknowledging the impact of our results.

<title>The Potential of Self-Regulation for Front-Running Prevention on DEXes</title>

<div> 关键词：交易排序依赖、智能合约、去中心化交易所（DEX）、前端攻击、市场设计

总结:

本文通过构建一个博弈论模型，深入研究了去中心化交易所（DEX）中专业交易者、散户交易者和流动性提供者的行为。该模型揭示了在低比例（低于1%）的订单流量来自散户交易者的情况下，交易者和流动性提供者的个人利益与市场的社会利益一致，从而有效消除前端攻击。然而，当散户交易者在订单流量中所占比例增加到约10%时，流动性提供者倾向于留在不保护免受前端攻击的池中。

文章指出，尽管在特定条件下市场能够自我调节以防止前端攻击，但其收益可能较小，不足以激励市场参与者。为了实现这一目标，需要对交易者进行教育并提供额外的激励措施，以确保市场的自我监管机制得到采纳。这强调了在去中心化交易所环境中，平衡个人利益与社会利益的重要性，以及促进市场健康发展的多方面策略的必要性。 <div>

Abstract: The transaction ordering dependency of the smart contracts building decentralized exchanges (DEXes) allow for predatory trading strategies. In particular, front-running attacks present a constant risk for traders on DEXes. Whereas legal regulation outlaws most front-running practices in traditional finance, such measures are ineffective in preventing front-running on DEXes. While novel market designs hindering front-running may emerge, it remains unclear whether the market's participants, in particular, liquidity providers, would be willing to adopt these new designs. A misalignment of the participant's private incentives and the market's social incentives can hinder the market from adopting an effective prevention mechanism.
  We present a game-theoretic model to study the behavior of sophisticated traders, retail traders, and liquidity providers in DEXes. Sophisticated traders adjust for front-running attacks, while retail traders do not, likely due to lack of knowledge or irrationality. Our findings show that with less than 1% of order flow from retail traders, traders' and liquidity providers' interests align with the market's social incentives - eliminating front-running attacks. However, the benefit from embracing this novel market is often small and may not suffice to entice them. With retail traders making up a larger proportion (around 10%) of the order flow, liquidity providers tend to stay in pools that do not protect against front-running. This suggests both educating traders and providing additional incentives for liquidity providers are necessary for market self-regulation.

<div> 关键词：区块链、Maximal Extractable Value（MEV）、Layer-2解决方案、rollup、Ethereum

<br /><br />
总结:
本文探讨了去中心化金融的兴起如何改变了区块链上的资产交易，并引入了被称为Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)的一系列剥削性经济实践。同时，去中心化金融采用了基于Layer-2的解决方案，如Arbitrum、Optimism和zkSync，以较低的交易成本促进资产交易，相比底层解决方案如Ethereum。然而，这些Layer-2解决方案缺乏类似于Ethereum的公共内存池，这使得从MEV中获利变得更加困难。研究发现，尽管在Rollup上进行的交易量与Ethereum相当，但Rollup上的MEV成本较低，利润也显著低于Ethereum。此外，研究还关注了Rollup上的“三明治攻击”现象，虽然没有直接检测到这类攻击在流行Rollup上的活动，但识别到了通过跨Rollup和Ethereum的交易实现的潜在“三明治攻击”。最终，研究提出了三种利用跨层交易的新攻击模式，并估计攻击者可能已经通过跨层“三明治攻击”赚取了约2百万美元。 <div>

Abstract: The emergence of decentralized finance has transformed asset trading on the blockchain, making traditional financial instruments more accessible while also introducing a series of exploitative economic practices known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). Concurrently, decentralized finance has embraced rollup-based Layer-2 solutions to facilitate asset trading at reduced transaction costs compared to Layer-1 solutions such as Ethereum. However, rollups lack a public mempool like Ethereum, making the extraction of MEV more challenging. In this paper, we investigate the prevalence and impact of MEV on Ethereum and prominent rollups such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync over a nearly three-year period. Our analysis encompasses various metrics including volume, profits, costs, competition, and response time to MEV opportunities. We discover that MEV is widespread on rollups, with trading volume comparable to Ethereum. We also find that, although MEV costs are lower on rollups, profits are also significantly lower compared to Ethereum. Additionally, we examine the prevalence of sandwich attacks on rollups. While our findings did not detect any sandwiching activity on popular rollups, we did identify the potential for cross-layer sandwich attacks facilitated by transactions that are sent across rollups and Ethereum. Consequently, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of three novel attacks that exploit cross-layer transactions, revealing that attackers could have already earned approximately 2 million USD through cross-layer sandwich attacks.

Abstract: Blockchain is widely applied in logistics, finance, and agriculture. As single blockchain users grow, scalability becomes crucial. However, existing works lack a comprehensive summary of blockchain scalability. They focus on single chains or cross-chain technologies. This survey summarizes scalability across the physical and logical layers, as well as inner-chain, inter-chain, and technology dimensions. The physical layer covers data and protocols, while the logical layer represents blockchain architecture. Each component is analyzed from inner-chain and inter-chain perspectives, considering technological factors. The aim is to enhance researchers' understanding of blockchain's architecture, data, and protocols to advance scalability research.

<div> 关键词：多智能体强化学习、集中式训练与执行、集中式训练分散式执行、分散式训练与执行、合作性

总结:
本文旨在介绍并总结集中式训练与分散式执行（CTDE）在合作性多智能体强化学习（MARL）中的应用。CTDE方法结合了集中式信息的优势进行训练，但在执行阶段采用分散式策略，仅使用每个智能体在执行过程中可获取的信息。这种范式要求在训练阶段进行专门的集中式处理，以利用所有可用信息，如其他智能体的策略或环境状态等。相较于集中式训练与执行（CTE），CTDE在扩展性方面通常更为优越，执行阶段无需通信，且往往能表现出良好的性能。

CTDE方法特别适用于合作场景，但根据所假设的观察信息，也可能应用于竞争或混合设置。CTDE在多智能体系统中提供了一种平衡集中化和分散化优势的策略，有助于解决复杂任务中的协作问题，同时保持系统的灵活性和效率。

尽管本文不涵盖CTDE MARL领域的所有工作，作者已选取具有重要性的研究来阐述主要概念，并对未能提及的研究表示歉意。通过此文本，读者可以更好地理解CTDE在多智能体系统中的作用及其在不同场景下的应用潜力。 <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has exploded in popularity in recent years. Many approaches have been developed but they can be divided into three main types: centralized training and execution (CTE), centralized training for decentralized execution (CTDE), and Decentralized training and execution (DTE).
  CTDE methods are the most common as they can use centralized information during training but execute in a decentralized manner -- using only information available to that agent during execution. CTDE is the only paradigm that requires a separate training phase where any available information (e.g., other agent policies, underlying states) can be used. As a result, they can be more scalable than CTE methods, do not require communication during execution, and can often perform well. CTDE fits most naturally with the cooperative case, but can be potentially applied in competitive or mixed settings depending on what information is assumed to be observed.
  This text is an introduction to CTDE in cooperative MARL. It is meant to explain the setting, basic concepts, and common methods. It does not cover all work in CTDE MARL as the subarea is quite extensive. I have included work that I believe is important for understanding the main concepts in the subarea and apologize to those that I have omitted.

<div> 关键词：隐私保护、联邦学习、原型聚类、对比学习、跨域推荐

<br /><br />
总结:

文章介绍了一种名为FedPCL-CDR的新方法，用于隐私保护下的跨域推荐（Cross-domain recommendation, CDR）。该方法通过利用非重叠用户信息和原型聚类来提高多领域性能，同时保护用户隐私。FedPCL-CDR由本地域学习模块和全局服务器聚合模块组成。在本地域中，FedPCL-CDR通过聚类所有用户数据生成代表性的原型，有效利用非重叠用户信息并解决用户稀疏重叠问题。通过在本地和全局原型之间进行对比学习，它促进了知识转移。全局服务器则从本地域收集代表原型，学习本地和全局原型。该方法结合了原型和联邦学习（FL），确保敏感用户数据保持去中心化，仅共享原型跨域，从而保护用户隐私。实验证明，FedPCL-CDR在四个实际世界跨域任务上的表现优于现有的基线方法。 <div>
arXiv:2409.03294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to improve recommendation accuracy in sparse domains by transferring knowledge from data-rich domains. However, existing CDR methods often assume the availability of user-item interaction data across domains, overlooking user privacy concerns. Furthermore, these methods suffer from performance degradation in scenarios with sparse overlapping users, as they typically depend on a large number of fully shared users for effective knowledge transfer. To address these challenges, we propose a Federated Prototype-based Contrastive Learning (CL) method for Privacy-Preserving CDR, named FedPCL-CDR. This approach utilizes non-overlapping user information and prototypes to improve multi-domain performance while protecting user privacy. FedPCL-CDR comprises two modules: local domain (client) learning and global server aggregation. In the local domain, FedPCL-CDR clusters all user data to learn representative prototypes, effectively utilizing non-overlapping user information and addressing the sparse overlapping user issue. It then facilitates knowledge transfer by employing both local and global prototypes returned from the server in a CL manner. Simultaneously, the global server aggregates representative prototypes from local domains to learn both local and global prototypes. The combination of prototypes and federated learning (FL) ensures that sensitive user data remains decentralized, with only prototypes being shared across domains, thereby protecting user privacy. Extensive experiments on four CDR tasks using two real-world datasets demonstrate that FedPCL-CDR outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

总结:
文章提出了Tyche，一种基于承诺和揭示方法的多党彩票协议家族。这些协议旨在实现高效、抗退出和抵抗多数联盟攻击，仅需使用碰撞抵抗哈希函数。Tyche协议利用区块链作为公共公告板、买进资金收集及结算工具，但不依赖其或任何第三方提供随机性。协议设计确保了任何诚实参与者都能最终解决彩票问题，而欺诈行为不会降低任何诚实参与者的中奖概率。

进一步地，文章将所有三个协议转换为匿名彩票，满足特定条件时，中奖者与特定参与者无法关联。证明了Tyche协议的安全性、公平性和隐私保护特性。最后，通过在Sui区块链上实施，评估了协议的性能，特别是在交易费用方面的表现，发现单用户交易费用相对较低，这表明协议有可能支持数百万参与者的应用。 <div>
arXiv:2409.03464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Tyche, a family of protocols for performing practically (as well as asymptotically) efficient multiparty lotteries, resistant against aborts and majority coalitions. Our protocols are based on a commit-and-reveal approach, requiring only a collision-resistant hash function.
  All our protocols use a blockchain as a public bulletin board and for buy-in collection and payout settlement. Importantly though, they do not rely on it or any other third party for providing randomness. Also, participants are not required to post any collateral beyond their buy-in. Any honest participant can eventually settle the lottery, and dishonest behavior never reduces the winning probability of any honest participant.
  Further, we adapt all three protocols into anonymous lotteries, where (under certain conditions) the winner is unlinkable to any particular participant. We show that our protocols are secure, fair, and some preserve the participants' privacy.
  Finally, we evaluate the performance of our protocols, particularly in terms of transaction fees, by implementing them on the Sui blockchain. There we see that per user transaction fees are reasonably low and our protocols could potentially support millions of participants.

<div> 关键词：Identity Management Systems、Self-sovereign identity、Blockchain、General Data Protection Regulation、Research Gaps

总结:

本文聚焦于身份管理系统的演进与自主权身份（SSI）框架的现状。首先，作者强调了传统身份管理系统（包括孤立式、集中式和联邦式）在电子服务中的作用，这些系统主要依赖身份提供者（IdPs）来在用户和服务提供商之间建立信任。然而，这些过程涉及收集、处理或存储个人数据的风险，可能导致数据泄露。

为了解决这一问题，自主权身份作为一种新兴的身份管理系统模型被引入，旨在通过赋予数据所有者对个人数据的控制权来减少数据泄露的可能性。在SSI中，数据所有者的数字钱包负责存储其个人数据，并拥有完全控制权。

文章回顾了区块链解决方案在通用数据保护条例（GDPR）下的应用，并系统地搜索了近期的SSI和区块链提案。通过对检索到的文档进行合规性评估，探讨了它们的潜力、限制和局限性。此外，该研究还识别了研究缺口和机遇，指出在SSI领域仍需进一步探索和解决的问题。

通过分析和比较不同方法，文章旨在为身份管理和数据保护领域提供有价值的见解，促进更安全、更私密的在线环境的发展。 <div>

Abstract: Identity Management Systems (IdMs) have complemented how users are identified, authenticated, and authorised on e-services. Among the methods used for this purpose are traditional IdMs (isolated, centralised and federated) that mostly rely on identity providers (IdPs) to broker trust between a user and service-providers (SPs). An IdP also identifies and authenticates a user on-behalf of the SP, who then determines the authorisation of the user. In these processes, both SP and IdP collect, process or store private users' data, which can be prone to breach. One approach to address the data breach is to relieve the IdP, and return control and storage of personal data to the owner. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) was introduced as an IdM model to reduce the possibility of data breaches by offering control of personal data to the owner. SSI is a decentralised IdM, where the data owner has sovereign control of personal data stored in their digital wallet. Since SSI is an emerging technology, its components and methods require careful evaluation. This paper provides an evolution to IdMs and reviews the state-of-the-art SSI frameworks. We explored articles in the literature that reviewed blockchain solutions for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We systematically searched recent SSI and blockchain proposals, evaluated the compliance of the retrieved documents with the GDPR privacy principles, and discussed their potentials, constraints, and limitations. This work identifies potential research gaps and opportunities.

Abstract: Cryptocoins (i.e., Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin) are tradable digital assets. Ownerships of cryptocoins are registered on distributed ledgers (i.e., blockchains). Secure encryption techniques guarantee the security of the transactions (transfers of coins among owners), registered into the ledger. Cryptocoins are exchanged for specific trading prices. The extreme volatility of such trading prices across all different sets of crypto-assets remains undisputed. However, the relations between the trading prices across different cryptocoins remains largely unexplored. Major coin exchanges indicate trend correlation to advise for sells or buys. However, price correlations remain largely unexplored. We shed some light on the trend correlations across a large variety of cryptocoins, by investigating their coin/price correlation trends over the past two years. We study the causality between the trends, and exploit the derived correlations to understand the accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting techniques for time series modeling (e.g., GBMs, LSTM and GRU) of correlated cryptocoins. Our evaluation shows (i) strong correlation patterns between the most traded coins (e.g., Bitcoin and Ether) and other types of cryptocurrencies, and (ii) state-of-the-art time series forecasting algorithms can be used to forecast cryptocoins price trends. We released datasets and code to reproduce our analysis to the research community.

Abstract: Smart contracts on the blockchain offer decentralized financial services but often lack robust security measures, resulting in significant economic losses. Although substantial research has focused on identifying vulnerabilities, a notable gap remains in evaluating the malicious intent behind their development. To address this, we introduce \textsc{SmartIntentNN} (Smart Contract Intent Neural Network), a deep learning-based tool designed to automate the detection of developers' intent in smart contracts. Our approach integrates a Universal Sentence Encoder for contextual representation of smart contract code, employs a K-means clustering algorithm to highlight intent-related code features, and utilizes a bidirectional LSTM-based multi-label classification network to predict ten distinct types of high-risk intent. Evaluations on a dataset of 10,000 smart contracts demonstrate that \textsc{SmartIntentNN} surpasses all baselines, achieving an F1-score of up to 0.8633.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a fast and decentralized state estimation framework for the control of legged locomotion. The nonlinear estimation of the floating base states is decentralized to an orientation estimation via Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a linear velocity estimation via Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE). The EKF fuses the inertia sensor with vision to estimate the floating base orientation. The MHE uses the estimated orientation with all the sensors within a time window in the past to estimate the linear velocities based on a time-varying linear dynamics formulation of the interested states with state constraints. More importantly, a marginalization method based on the optimization structure of the full information filter (FIF) is proposed to convert the equality-constrained FIF to an equivalent MHE. This decoupling of state estimation promotes the desired balance of computation efficiency, accuracy of estimation, and the inclusion of state constraints. The proposed method is shown to be capable of providing accurate state estimation to several legged robots, including the highly dynamic hopping robot PogoX, the bipedal robot Cassie, and the quadrupedal robot Unitree Go1, with a frequency at 200 Hz and a window interval of 0.1s.

Abstract: As blockchain technology rapidly evolves, the demand for enhanced efficiency, security, and scalability grows.Transformer models, as powerful deep learning architectures,have shown unprecedented potential in addressing various blockchain challenges. However, a systematic review of Transformer applications in blockchain is lacking. This paper aims to fill this research gap by surveying over 200 relevant papers, comprehensively reviewing practical cases and research progress of Transformers in blockchain applications. Our survey covers key areas including anomaly detection, smart contract security analysis, cryptocurrency prediction and trend analysis, and code summary generation. To clearly articulate the advancements of Transformers across various blockchain domains, we adopt a domain-oriented classification system, organizing and introducing representative methods based on major challenges in current blockchain research. For each research domain,we first introduce its background and objectives, then review previous representative methods and analyze their limitations,and finally introduce the advancements brought by Transformer models. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of utilizing Transformer, such as data privacy, model complexity, and real-time processing requirements. Finally, this article proposes future research directions, emphasizing the importance of exploring the Transformer architecture in depth to adapt it to specific blockchain applications, and discusses its potential role in promoting the development of blockchain technology. This review aims to provide new perspectives and a research foundation for the integrated development of blockchain technology and machine learning, supporting further innovation and application expansion of blockchain technology.

<br /><br />
总结:

文章探讨了联邦学习(Federated Learning, FL)中一个关键问题——如何处理分布式设备贡献的噪声数据。在联邦学习中，模型通过在各设备上训练并共享参数来协作学习，而数据的分散存储有助于保护用户隐私。然而，由于设备端数据可能受到各种噪声和干扰的影响，这直接影响到模型聚合过程的准确性和最终模型的质量。

为解决这一问题，研究者提出了一种全面评估客户端输入在梯度空间中的方法，基于对模型在干净与噪声输入数据上训练后梯度范数分布差异的观察。他们引入了一种简单而有效的策略，用于在联邦学习的初始阶段识别出数据质量较低的客户端。接着，他们提出了名为Federated Noise-Sifting (FedNS) 的噪声感知联邦学习聚合方法，该方法可作为现有联邦学习策略的插件使用，以增强模型性能。

通过在不同基准数据集下的广泛实验，研究结果表明，FedNS能够显著提高在有噪声的分散数据上的全局模型性能。在独立同分布(IID)和非独立同分布(non-IID)设置下，与标准联邦学习策略相比，FedNS可以分别提升高达13.68%和15.85%的性能。这一发现强调了在联邦学习中识别和处理噪声数据的重要性，并提供了一种有效的方法来改进模型的泛化能力和整体性能。 <div>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent method for collaboratively training machine learning models using local data from edge devices, all while keeping data decentralized. However, accounting for the quality of data contributed by local clients remains a critical challenge in FL, as local data are often susceptible to corruption by various forms of noise and perturbations, which compromise the aggregation process and lead to a subpar global model. In this work, we focus on addressing the problem of noisy data in the input space, an under-explored area compared to the label noise. We propose a comprehensive assessment of client input in the gradient space, inspired by the distinct disparity observed between the density of gradient norm distributions of models trained on noisy and clean input data. Based on this observation, we introduce a straightforward yet effective approach to identify clients with low-quality data at the initial stage of FL. Furthermore, we propose a noise-aware FL aggregation method, namely Federated Noise-Sifting (FedNS), which can be used as a plug-in approach in conjunction with widely used FL strategies. Our extensive evaluation on diverse benchmark datasets under different federated settings demonstrates the efficacy of FedNS. Our method effortlessly integrates with existing FL strategies, enhancing the global model's performance by up to 13.68% in IID and 15.85% in non-IID settings when learning from noisy decentralized data.

<div> 关键词：雪球协议、雪崩协议、网络韧性、模拟实验、拜占庭容错

总结:
本文探讨了雪球和雪崩这两种底层协议在流行雪崩区块链中的鲁棒性特性。通过在Rust中实现的模拟实验，研究者量化了在对手策略性重新平衡网络以延迟终止的情况下雪球协议的鲁棒性。结果显示，在节点数量为n的同等权益网络中，当对手控制超过$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$节点时，可破坏活锁。具体而言，对于n=2000的网络，只需控制约5.2%的权益就能成功攻击活锁。若对手获得有关网络状态的额外信息（无通信或其他优势），所需的权益比例降低至仅需2.8%即可成功攻击。研究还表明，对手可以以指数时间依赖于其权益、与网络规模成反比的方式破坏安全性，例如在3000节点网络中，当对手控制25%权益时，预期需要大约265轮次。

研究结论指出，雪球和雪崩协议类似于拜占庭可靠广播协议，而非共识机制，这揭示了它们在网络安全性和稳定性方面的关键特性。 <div>

Abstract: This work examines the resilience properties of the Snowball and Avalanche protocols that underlie the popular Avalanche blockchain. We experimentally quantify the resilience of Snowball using a simulation implemented in Rust, where the adversary strategically rebalances the network to delay termination.
  We show that in a network of $n$ nodes of equal stake, the adversary is able to break liveness when controlling $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ nodes. Specifically, for $n = 2000$, a simple adversary controlling $5.2\%$ of stake can successfully attack liveness. When the adversary is given additional information about the state of the network (without any communication or other advantages), the stake needed for a successful attack is as little as $2.8\%$. We show that the adversary can break safety in time exponentially dependent on their stake, and inversely linearly related to the size of the network, e.g. in 265 rounds in expectation when the adversary controls $25\%$ of a network of 3000.
  We conclude that Snowball and Avalanche are akin to Byzantine reliable broadcast protocols as opposed to consensus.

<div> 关键词：输入输出模型、网络不确定性、结构化鲁棒稳定性、分散型条件、集成二次约束

总结:

本文的主要结果涉及对包含链接不确定性的网络输入-输出模型的结构化鲁棒稳定性分析。通过构建一系列集成二次约束，这些约束共同保证了网络动态的鲁棒稳定性。与现有依赖于单一节点邻域信息的分散型条件相比，新提出的条件覆盖了更广泛的邻域，从而提供了更宽松、更灵活的稳定性评估框架。

具体而言，新条件不仅在逻辑上更加全面地考虑了网络中各个节点及其邻域的信息，而且在实践应用中能够显著降低对局部问题数据的保守性依赖，从而提高稳定性分析的精确度和效率。这为复杂网络系统的设计和优化提供了更为有效的工具，尤其是在面对不确定性因素时，能够提供更强的鲁棒性和适应性。

为了验证这一方法的有效性，文章还通过一个数值实例进行了展示，说明了新提出的广域条件相对于传统局部条件在稳定性分析上的优势。这一研究成果对于网络科学、控制系统理论以及相关工程领域的研究和应用具有重要的参考价值。 <div>

Abstract: The main result relates to structured robust stability analysis of an input-output model for networks with link uncertainty. It constitutes a collection of integral quadratic constraints, which together imply robust stability of the uncertain networked dynamics. Each condition is decentralized in the sense that it depends on model data pertaining to the neighbourhood of a specific agent. By contrast, pre-existing conditions for the network model are link-wise decentralized, with each involving conservatively more localized problem data. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the advantage of the new broader neighbourhood conditions.

Abstract: In recent years, a more advanced form of phishing has arisen on Ethereum, surpassing early-stage, simple transaction phishing. This new form, which we refer to as payload-based transaction phishing (PTXPHISH), manipulates smart contract interactions through the execution of malicious payloads to deceive users. PTXPHISH has rapidly emerged as a significant threat, leading to incidents that caused losses exceeding \$70 million in 2023 reports. Despite its substantial impact, no previous studies have systematically explored PTXPHISH
  In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of the PTXPHISH on Ethereum. Firstly, we conduct a long-term data collection and put considerable effort into establishing the first ground-truth PTXPHISH dataset, consisting of 5,000 phishing transactions. Based on the dataset, we dissect PTXPHISH, categorizing phishing tactics into four primary categories and eleven sub-categories. Secondly, we propose a rule-based multi-dimensional detection approach to identify PTXPHISH, achieving over 99% accuracy in the ground-truth dataset. Finally, we conducted a large-scale detection spanning 300 days and discovered a total of 130,637 phishing transactions on Ethereum, resulting in losses exceeding $341.9 million. Our in-depth analysis of these phishing transactions yielded valuable and insightful findings.
  Furthermore, our work has made significant contributions to mitigating real-world threats. We have reported 1,726 phishing addresses to the community, accounting for 42.7% of total community contributions during the same period. Additionally, we have sent 2,539 on-chain alert messages, assisting 1,980 victims. This research serves as a valuable reference in combating the emerging PTXPHISH and safeguarding users' assets.

总结:
本文提出了一种基于遮挡的策略，用于利用一群移动机器人进行凹面物体的集体运输。该研究旨在通过分布式方法解决使用凹面物体时遇到的挑战。特别之处在于，机器人在执行任务时无需了解物体的具体几何形状，也不需要直接交流信息。基本思路是通过填充一定数量的机器人到物体的凹陷部分，从而形成一个新的凸形“伪物体”，随后对这个新形成的物体实施基于遮挡的集体运输策略。

文章将工作分为两部分：第一部分涉及对各种不同形状的凹面物体进行凹陷填充；第二部分则关注于如何对新形成的凸形物体进行集体运输。整个研究旨在探索和优化机器人在未知复杂环境下进行高效协作的可能途径，特别是针对具有特定几何特性的物体，如凹面物体。通过实施这一策略，研究人员希望提高机器人系统在实际应用中的灵活性和适应性，特别是在处理非标准或难以预测的物体时。 <div>

Abstract: An occlusion based strategy for collective transport of a concave object using a swarm of mobile robots has been proposed in this paper. We aim to overcome the challenges of transporting concave objects using decentralized approach. The interesting aspect of this task is that the agents have no prior knowledge about the geometry of the object and do not explicitly communicate with each other. The concept is to eliminate the concavity of the object by filling a number of robots in its cavity and then carry out an occlusion based transport strategy on the newly formed convex object or "pseudo object". We divide our work into two parts: concavity filling of various concave objects and occlusion based collective transport of convex objects.

Abstract: Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) is significantly enhancing the efficiency, safety, and computational capabilities of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), and the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) further elevates these advantages by incorporating flexible and auxiliary services. This evolving UAV-integrated VFC paradigm opens new doors while presenting unique complexities within the cooperative computation framework. Foremost among the challenges, modeling the intricate dynamics of aerial-ground interactive computing networks is a significant endeavor, and the absence of a comprehensive and flexible simulation platform may impede the exploration of this field. Inspired by the pressing need for a versatile tool, this paper provides a lightweight and modular aerial-ground collaborative simulation platform, termed AirFogSim. We present the design and implementation of AirFogSim, and demonstrate its versatility with five key missions in the domain of UAV-integrated VFC. A multifaceted use case is carried out to validate AirFogSim's effectiveness, encompassing several integral aspects of the proposed AirFogSim, including UAV trajectory, task offloading, resource allocation, and blockchain. In general, AirFogSim is envisioned to set a new precedent in the UAV-integrated VFC simulation, bridge the gap between theoretical design and practical validation, and pave the way for future intelligent transportation domains.

总结:
本文提出了一种针对自主水下车辆(AUV)的两层控制框架，旨在处理未知的不确定非线性动力学问题，如质量矩阵。与以往研究不同的是，此框架使控制器独立于机器人配置和变化的环境条件。该框架适用于不同环境条件下的AUV操作，能有效管理如水粘度和流体流动变化等环境因素对AUV的有效质量和阻尼动态的影响。

Abstract: This paper presents a two-layer control framework for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) designed to handle uncertain nonlinear dynamics, including the mass matrix, previously assumed known. Unlike prior studies, this approach makes the controller independent of the robot's configuration and varying environmental conditions. The proposed framework applies across different environmental conditions affecting AUVs. It features a first-layer cooperative estimator and a second-layer decentralized deterministic learning controller. This architecture supports robust operation under diverse underwater scenarios, managing environmental effects like changes in water viscosity and flow, which impact the AUV's effective mass and damping dynamics. The first-layer estimator enables seamless inter-agent communication by sharing crucial system estimates without relying on global information. The second-layer controller uses local feedback to adjust each AUV's trajectory, ensuring accurate formation control and dynamic adaptability. Radial basis function neural networks enable local learning and knowledge storage, allowing AUVs to efficiently reapply learned dynamics after system restarts. Simulations validate the effectiveness of this framework, marking it as a significant advancement in distributed adaptive control systems for AUVs, enhancing operational flexibility and resilience in unpredictable marine environments.

Abstract: In the digital era, blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have transformed financial and decentralized systems. However, existing research often neglects the spatiotemporal variations in public sentiment toward these technologies, limiting macro-level insights into their global impact. This study leverages Twitter data to explore public attention and sentiment across 150 countries, analyzing over 150 million geotagged tweets from 2012 to 2022. Sentiment scores were derived using a BERT-based multilingual sentiment model trained on 7.4 billion tweets. The analysis integrates global cryptocurrency regulations and economic indicators from the World Development Indicators database. Results reveal significant global sentiment variations influenced by economic factors, with more developed nations engaging more in discussions, while less developed countries show higher sentiment levels. Geographically weighted regression indicates that GDP-tweet engagement correlation intensifies following Bitcoin price surges. Topic modeling shows that countries within similar economic clusters share discussion trends, while different clusters focus on distinct topics. This study highlights global disparities in sentiment toward decentralized finance, shaped by economic and regional factors, with implications for poverty alleviation, cryptocurrency crime, and sustainable development. The dataset and code are publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Distributed optimization is the standard way of speeding up machine learning training, and most of the research in the area focuses on distributed first-order, gradient-based methods. Yet, there are settings where some computationally-bounded nodes may not be able to implement first-order, gradient-based optimization, while they could still contribute to joint optimization tasks. In this paper, we initiate the study of hybrid decentralized optimization, studying settings where nodes with zeroth-order and first-order optimization capabilities co-exist in a distributed system, and attempt to jointly solve an optimization task over some data distribution. We essentially show that, under reasonable parameter settings, such a system can not only withstand noisier zeroth-order agents but can even benefit from integrating such agents into the optimization process, rather than ignoring their information. At the core of our approach is a new analysis of distributed optimization with noisy and possibly-biased gradient estimators, which may be of independent interest. Our results hold for both convex and non-convex objectives. Experimental results on standard optimization tasks confirm our analysis, showing that hybrid first-zeroth order optimization can be practical, even when training deep neural networks.

Abstract: We study provable multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) in the general framework of partially observable stochastic games (POSGs). To circumvent the known hardness results and the use of computationally intractable oracles, we advocate leveraging the potential \emph{information-sharing} among agents, a common practice in empirical multi-agent RL, and a standard model for multi-agent control systems with communications. We first establish several computational complexity results to justify the necessity of information-sharing, as well as the observability assumption that has enabled quasi-efficient single-agent RL with partial observations, for efficiently solving POSGs. {Inspired by the inefficiency of planning in the ground-truth model,} we then propose to further \emph{approximate} the shared common information to construct an {approximate model} of the POSG, in which planning an approximate \emph{equilibrium} (in terms of solving the original POSG) can be quasi-efficient, i.e., of quasi-polynomial-time, under the aforementioned assumptions. Furthermore, we develop a partially observable multi-agent RL algorithm that is \emph{both} statistically and computationally quasi-efficient. {Finally, beyond equilibrium learning, we extend our algorithmic framework to finding the \emph{team-optimal solution} in cooperative POSGs, i.e., decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes, a much more challenging goal. We establish concrete computational and sample complexities under several common structural assumptions of the model.} We hope our study could open up the possibilities of leveraging and even designing different \emph{information structures}, a well-studied notion in control theory, for developing both sample- and computation-efficient partially observable multi-agent RL.

<div> 关键词：分布式检测、社会学习规则、错误概率、网络不平衡、改进学习规则

总结:

本文探讨了分布式检测领域中，特别是Lalitha等人提出的基于有向图的社会学习规则的固有限制。在分布式检测框架下，网络中的节点通过与邻居交换观察到的数据信息，共同推断未知假设。每个节点根据接收到的邻居信息调整其私人信念，仅需了解其观测数据的生成分布。

首先指出，原始的社会学习规则能够实现随样本数量无限增大而趋向于零的错误概率，但相较于集中式处理方式，它在可达到的错误指数方面存在差距。这种差距源于节点自定义权重选择导致的网络不平衡问题。为解决这一问题，文章提出了改进的学习规则，证明该规则可以达到与集中式设置相等的错误指数大小。这表明，分布式处理在错误概率的指数衰减速率上几乎不存在一阶代价。简而言之，通过优化节点间的权重分配策略，可以有效缩小分布式检测与集中式检测在性能上的差距，提高系统整体的决策准确性。 <div>

Abstract: Fundamental limits on the error probabilities of a family of decentralized detection algorithms (eg., the social learning rule proposed by Lalitha et al. over directed graphs are investigated. In decentralized detection, a network of nodes locally exchanging information about the samples they observe with their neighbors to collectively infer the underlying unknown hypothesis. Each node in the network weighs the messages received from its neighbors to form its private belief and only requires knowledge of the data generating distribution of its observation. In this work, it is first shown that while the original social learning rule of Lalitha et al. achieves asymptotically vanishing error probabilities as the number of samples tends to infinity, it suffers a gap in the achievable error exponent compared to the centralized case. The gap is due to the network imbalance caused by the local weights that each node chooses to weigh the messages received from its neighbors. To close this gap, a modified learning rule is proposed and shown to achieve error exponents as large as those in the centralized setup. This implies that there is essentially no first-order penalty caused by decentralization in the exponentially decaying rate of error probabilities.

<div> 关键词：未知环境、演化群体机器人、路径形成、任务分配、视觉子目标

总结:

本文从演化群体机器人视角探讨了在未知环境下进行探索与导航的挑战。重点在于路径形成，这是使协同工作群体机器人有效导航的基础。研究设计了一个基于有限状态机的任务分配和路径形成过程，确保了决策的系统性和状态转换的高效性。该方法采用去中心化策略，允许每个机器人基于局部信息独立作出决策，从而提高系统的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

研究提出了一种基于视觉子目标的路径形成新方法，通过连接视觉上相连的子目标来建立地点之间的路径。在Argos模拟器上进行的仿真实验表明，这种方法在大多数试验中成功形成了路径。然而，大量机器人在路径形成期间的相互碰撞（交通）问题可能影响性能。为解决这一问题，研究提出了一种任务分配策略，利用局部通信协议和光信号通信管理机器人部署。该策略评估两点间的距离并确定执行路径形成任务所需的最优机器人数量，从而减少不必要的探索和交通拥堵。

研究比较了基于视觉子目标的路径形成方法和任务分配策略与A*算法的性能，包括路径长度、时间以及资源使用情况。仿真结果证明了所提出方法的有效性，突出了其在规模性、鲁棒性和故障容错方面的优势。 <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of exploration and navigation in unknown environments from the perspective of evolutionary swarm robotics. A key focus is on path formation, which is essential for enabling cooperative swarm robots to navigate effectively. We designed the task allocation and path formation process based on a finite state machine, ensuring systematic decision-making and efficient state transitions. The approach is decentralized, allowing each robot to make decisions independently based on local information, which enhances scalability and robustness. We present a novel subgoal-based path formation method that establishes paths between locations by leveraging visually connected subgoals. Simulation experiments conducted in the Argos simulator show that this method successfully forms paths in the majority of trials. However, inter-collision (traffic) among numerous robots during path formation can negatively impact performance. To address this issue, we propose a task allocation strategy that uses local communication protocols and light signal-based communication to manage robot deployment. This strategy assesses the distance between points and determines the optimal number of robots needed for the path formation task, thereby reducing unnecessary exploration and traffic congestion. The performance of both the subgoal-based path formation method and the task allocation strategy is evaluated by comparing the path length, time, and resource usage against the A* algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its scalability, robustness, and fault tolerance.

<div> 关键词：Container Data Item（CDI）、微服务、数据共享、安全性、隔离性

总结:
本文介绍了Container Data Item（CDI）这一抽象数据类型，旨在使多个容器能够高效地操作共同的数据项，同时保持其强大的安全性和隔离性。通过使用CDI，应用开发者能够在运行时控制共享数据项的所有权，实现不同容器之间的同步执行与数据共享。

CDI设计用于支持由一组相互连接的微服务组成的微服务架构，每个微服务由独立的容器实现。它确保在任何时刻只有一个容器拥有特定的CDI对象，并且只有当前CDI对象的所有者才能转移该对象的所有权。文章提供了三种不同的CDI实现方案，允许位于同一服务器或不同服务器上的容器利用CDI高效地操作共同的数据项。

此外，论文还对CDI进行了全面的性能评估，并展示了两个典型应用案例：增强现实应用和去中心化的流程编排器。通过这些实例，详细阐述了CDI如何在实际场景中提供高效、安全的数据共享解决方案。 <div>

Abstract: We present Container Data Item (CDI), an abstract datatype that allows multiple containers to efficiently operate on a common data item while preserving their strong security and isolation semantics. Application developers can use CDIs to enable multiple containers to operate on the same data, synchronize execution among themselves, and control the ownership of the shared data item during runtime. These containers may reside on the same server or different servers. CDI is designed to support microservice based applications comprised of a set of interconnected microservices, each implemented by a separate dedicated container. CDI preserves the important isolation semantics of containers by ensuring that exactly one container owns a CDI object at any instant and the ownership of a CDI object may be transferred from one container to another only by the current CDI object owner. We present three different implementations of CDI that allow different containers residing on the same server as well containers residing on different servers to use CDI for efficiently operating on a common data item. The paper provides an extensive performance evaluation of CDI along with two representative applications, an augmented reality application and a decentralized workflow orchestrator.

<div> 关键词：CyberCortex.AI、操作系统、人工智能、自动化应用、实时通信

总结:
本文介绍了一种名为CyberCortex.AI的新型机器人操作系统，其旨在为异构AI驱动的机器人和复杂自动化应用提供支撑。该系统具有分布式和去中心化特性，能够使机器人之间以及与云中的高性能计算机（HPC）进行通信。它通过将传感器和控制数据流式传输至HPC系统以用于AI算法的训练，然后将这些算法部署回机器人中。每个机器人功能（如传感器数据采集、路径规划、运动控制等）均在共享互联网的称为“DataBlock”的过滤器集合中执行，这些过滤器可以在机器人本地计算或在不同的机器人系统上远程计算。数据通过称为“Temporal Addressable Memory”（TAM）的组件存储和访问，该组件充当过滤器输入和输出之间的桥梁。CyberCortex.AI由两个主要组件构成：i) 在机器人嵌入式硬件上运行的实时实现的CyberCortex.AI.inference系统，以及ii) 在云中的HPC计算机上运行的CyberCortex.AI.dojo，用于设计、训练和部署AI算法。

为了评估此方法的性能，文章使用了两种协作机器人应用进行了定量和定性分析：i) 一个基于Unitree A1腿式机器人和Anafi Parrot 4K无人机的森林火灾预防系统，以及ii) 一个使用CyberCortex.AI进行协作感知和运动控制的自主驾驶系统。 <div>

Abstract: The underlying framework for controlling autonomous robots and complex automation applications are Operating Systems (OS) capable of scheduling perception-and-control tasks, as well as providing real-time data communication to other robotic peers and remote cloud computers. In this paper, we introduce CyberCortex.AI, a robotics OS designed to enable heterogeneous AI-based robotics and complex automation applications. CyberCortex.AI is a decentralized distributed OS which enables robots to talk to each other, as well as to High Performance Computers (HPC) in the cloud. Sensory and control data from the robots is streamed towards HPC systems with the purpose of training AI algorithms, which are afterwards deployed on the robots. Each functionality of a robot (e.g. sensory data acquisition, path planning, motion control, etc.) is executed within a so-called DataBlock of Filters shared through the internet, where each filter is computed either locally on the robot itself, or remotely on a different robotic system. The data is stored and accessed via a so-called \textit{Temporal Addressable Memory} (TAM), which acts as a gateway between each filter's input and output. CyberCortex.AI has two main components: i) the CyberCortex.AI.inference system, which is a real-time implementation of the DataBlock running on the robots' embedded hardware, and ii) the CyberCortex.AI.dojo, which runs on an HPC computer in the cloud, and it is used to design, train and deploy AI algorithms. We present a quantitative and qualitative performance analysis of the proposed approach using two collaborative robotics applications: \textit{i}) a forest fires prevention system based on an Unitree A1 legged robot and an Anafi Parrot 4K drone, as well as \textit{ii}) an autonomous driving system which uses CyberCortex.AI for collaborative perception and motion control.

Abstract: Blockchains have gained substantial attention from academia and industry for their ability to facilitate decentralized trust and communications. However, the rapid progress of quantum computing poses a significant threat to the security of existing blockchain technologies. Notably, the emergence of Shor's and Grover's algorithms raises concerns regarding the compromise of the cryptographic systems underlying blockchains. Consequently, it is essential to develop methods that reinforce blockchain technology against quantum attacks. In response to this challenge, two distinct approaches have been proposed. The first approach involves post-quantum blockchains, which aim to utilize classical cryptographic algorithms resilient to quantum attacks. The second approach explores quantum blockchains, which leverage the power of quantum computers and networks to rebuild the foundations of blockchains. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview and comparison of post-quantum and quantum blockchains while exploring open questions and remaining challenges in these domains. It offers an in-depth introduction, examines differences in blockchain structure, security, privacy, and other key factors, and concludes by discussing current research trends.

Abstract: Nowadays, federated recommendation technology is rapidly evolving to help multiple organisations share data and train models while meeting user privacy, data security and government regulatory requirements. However, federated recommendation increases customer system costs such as power, computational and communication resources. Besides, federated recommendation systems are also susceptible to model attacks and data poisoning by participating malicious clients. Therefore, most customers are unwilling to participate in federated recommendation without any incentive. To address these problems, we propose a blockchain-based federated recommendation system with incentive mechanism to promote more trustworthy, secure, and efficient federated recommendation service. First, we construct a federated recommendation system based on NeuMF and FedAvg. Then we introduce a reverse auction mechanism to select optimal clients that can maximize the social surplus. Finally, we employ blockchain for on-chain evidence storage of models to ensure the safety of the federated recommendation system. The experimental results show that our proposed incentive mechanism can attract clients with superior training data to engage in the federal recommendation at a lower cost, which can increase the economic benefit of federal recommendation by 54.9\% while improve the recommendation performance. Thus our work provides theoretical and technological support for the construction of a harmonious and healthy ecological environment for the application of federal recommendation.

<div> 关键词：连续联邦学习、灾难性遗忘、数据分布异构、任务边界、自适应联邦学习

总结:

本文聚焦于连续联邦学习（CFL）领域中的关键挑战——如何在多个分散客户端不断适应新数据流的同时，避免模型知识的遗忘。研究者提出了一种名为Fed-A-GEM的新方法，该方法是对已有A-GEM算法的联邦版本改编，旨在通过本地缓冲样本和聚合缓冲梯度来缓解灾难性遗忘问题。Fed-A-GEM通过利用这些技术，实现了在保持已学知识的同时，高效地学习新任务的能力。

文章指出，现有的CFL解决方案在设备存储限制和数据分布异质性方面存在局限性，而Fed-A-GEM通过结合现有CFL技术，显著提升了性能。实验结果表明，在CIFAR-100等基准数据集上，Fed-A-GEM能够将准确率提升高达27%，充分验证了其在多任务学习场景下的有效性。此外，作者还提供了实现代码，使得这一创新方法能够被更广泛的社区应用和研究。 <div>

Abstract: Continual Federated Learning (CFL) is essential for enabling real-world applications where multiple decentralized clients adaptively learn from continuous data streams. A significant challenge in CFL is mitigating catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge when learning new information. Existing approaches often face difficulties due to the constraints of device storage capacities and the heterogeneous nature of data distributions among clients. While some CFL algorithms have addressed these challenges, they frequently rely on unrealistic assumptions about the availability of task boundaries (i.e., knowing when new tasks begin). To address these limitations, we introduce Fed-A-GEM, a federated adaptation of the A-GEM method (Chaudhry et al., 2019), which employs a buffer-based gradient projection approach. Fed-A-GEM alleviates catastrophic forgetting by leveraging local buffer samples and aggregated buffer gradients, thus preserving knowledge across multiple clients. Our method is combined with existing CFL techniques, enhancing their performance in the CFL context. Our experiments on standard benchmarks show consistent performance improvements across diverse scenarios. For example, in a task-incremental learning scenario using the CIFAR-100 dataset, our method can increase the accuracy by up to 27%. Our code is available at https://github.com/shenghongdai/Fed-A-GEM.

<br /><br />
总结:

本文探讨了在太空态势感知(SSA)领域中，如何在缺乏完全信任的情况下，实现对居民空间物体(RSO)的无信任追踪。在当前环境下，RSO的位置信息可能被操纵，这引发了对RSO作为武器使用的担忧。传统的跟踪数据消息(TDM)格式存在数据质量参差不齐的问题，影响了SSA的可靠性。文章提出了一种基于区块链和深度学习的新型验证和验证机制。

通过利用区块链的去中心化和不可篡改特性，该机制可以实现无需中央权威的信任机制，确保共识为基础的真相。引入了一种先进的基于转换器的轨道推算器，其性能优于传统方法如SGP4，能够对单个RSO的多个观测结果进行交叉验证。此深度学习模型可分散部署在区块链上，允许参与方托管节点以包含分布式深度学习模型的一部分。

系统由分散观察者和基于权益证明(PoS)的区块链中的验证者组成。观察者通过贡献经过验证的TDM数据和股权来保证诚实，而验证者则运行推算和验证算法。对于贡献可信TDM的观察者，系统提供奖励；而对于提交无法验证数据的观察者，则施加惩罚。这一创新方法旨在提高SSA的可靠性和安全性，同时减少对单一数据源的信任依赖。 <div>

Abstract: Trustless tracking of Resident Space Objects (RSOs) is crucial for Space Situational Awareness (SSA), especially during adverse situations. The importance of transparent SSA cannot be overstated, as it is vital for ensuring space safety and security. In an era where RSO location information can be easily manipulated, the risk of RSOs being used as weapons is a growing concern. The Tracking Data Message (TDM) is a standardized format for broadcasting RSO observations. However, the varying quality of observations from diverse sensors poses challenges to SSA reliability. While many countries operate space assets, relatively few have SSA capabilities, making it crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. Current practices assume complete trust in the transmitting party, leaving SSA capabilities vulnerable to adversarial actions such as spoofing TDMs. This work introduces a trustless mechanism for TDM validation and verification using deep learning over blockchain. By leveraging the trustless nature of blockchain, our approach eliminates the need for a central authority, establishing consensus-based truth. We propose a state-of-the-art, transformer-based orbit propagator that outperforms traditional methods like SGP4, enabling cross-validation of multiple observations for a single RSO. This deep learning-based transformer model can be distributed over a blockchain, allowing interested parties to host a node that contains a part of the distributed deep learning model. Our system comprises decentralised observers and validators within a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain. Observers contribute TDM data along with a stake to ensure honesty, while validators run the propagation and validation algorithms. The system rewards observers for contributing verified TDMs and penalizes those submitting unverifiable data.

总结:

本文探讨了机器学习领域中，通过辅助数据进行统计推断的新方法——预测增强推断(Prediction-Powered Inference, PPI)，特别是在面对私有金标准数据不可共享的情况。这种情况下，数据隔离导致模型精度降低，进而影响统计有效性。为解决这一问题，作者提出了一种名为联邦预测增强推断(Federated Prediction-Powered Inference, Fed-PPI)的框架。

Fed-PPI框架通过以下步骤实现目标：

1. **本地模型训练**：在私有数据上独立训练多个局部模型。
2. **联邦学习聚合**：通过联邦学习技术将这些局部模型聚合起来，以减少数据集中性风险并保持数据隐私。
3. **PPI计算**：基于聚合后的模型，使用预测增强推断方法来计算置信区间，从而得出有效的统计结论。

实验结果验证了Fed-PPI框架的有效性，能够生成准确的置信区间，即使在面临数据隔离和私有信息保护的情况下也能保证统计推断的可靠性。 <div>

Abstract: In various domains, the increasing application of machine learning allows researchers to access inexpensive predictive data, which can be utilized as auxiliary data for statistical inference. Although such data are often unreliable compared to gold-standard datasets, Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) has been proposed to ensure statistical validity despite the unreliability. However, the challenge of `data silos' arises when the private gold-standard datasets are non-shareable for model training, leading to less accurate predictive models and invalid inferences. In this paper, we introduces the Federated Prediction-Powered Inference (Fed-PPI) framework, which addresses this challenge by enabling decentralized experimental data to contribute to statistically valid conclusions without sharing private information. The Fed-PPI framework involves training local models on private data, aggregating them through Federated Learning (FL), and deriving confidence intervals using PPI computation. The proposed framework is evaluated through experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing valid confidence intervals.

本文介绍了一项关于以太坊（Ethereum）的研究，重点在于智能合约的模糊测试技术。研究发现，名为DogeFuzz的新型模糊测试框架在识别智能合约中的漏洞方面表现出色。DogeFuzz包括了黑盒模糊测试和两种灰盒模糊测试策略：基于覆盖率的灰盒模糊测试（DogeFuzz-G）和定向灰盒模糊测试（DogeFuzz-DG）。尽管DogeFuzz没有利用高级输入生成技术，如符号执行或机器学习，它仍然在性能上超过了sFuzz和ILF这两款最先进的智能合约模糊测试器。

Abstract: Ethereum is a distributed, peer-to-peer blockchain infrastructure that has attracted billions of dollars. Perhaps due to its success, Ethereum has become a target for various kinds of attacks, motivating researchers to explore different techniques to identify vulnerabilities in EVM bytecode (the language of the Ethereum Virtual Machine), including formal verification, symbolic execution, and fuzz testing. Although recent studies empirically compare smart contract fuzzers, there is a lack of literature investigating how simpler greybox fuzzers compare to more advanced ones. To fill this gap, in this paper, we present DogeFuzz, an extensible infrastructure for fuzzing Ethereum smart contracts, currently supporting black-box fuzzing and two grey-box fuzzing strategies: coverage-guided grey-box fuzzing (DogeFuzz-G) and directed grey-box fuzzing (DogeFuzz-DG). We conduct a series of experiments using benchmarks already available in the literature and compare the DogeFuzz strategies with state-of-the-art fuzzers for smart contracts. Surprisingly, although DogeFuzz does not leverage advanced techniques for improving input generation (such as symbolic execution or machine learning), DogeFuzz outperforms sFuzz and ILF, two state-of-the-art fuzzers. Nonetheless, the Smartian fuzzer shows higher code coverage and bug-finding capabilities than DogeFuzz.

Abstract: Invariants are essential for ensuring the security and correctness of Solidity smart contracts, particularly in the context of blockchain's immutability and decentralized execution. This paper introduces InvSol, a novel framework for pre-deployment invariant generation tailored specifically for Solidity smart contracts. Unlike existing solutions, namely InvCon, InvCon+, and Trace2Inv, that rely on post-deployment transaction histories on Ethereum mainnet, InvSol identifies invariants before deployment and offers comprehensive coverage of Solidity language constructs, including loops. Additionally, InvSol incorporates custom templates to effectively prevent critical issues such as reentrancy, out-of-gas errors, and exceptions during invariant generation. We rigorously evaluate InvSol using a benchmark set of smart contracts and compare its performance with state-of-the-art solutions. Our findings reveal that InvSol significantly outperforms these tools, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling new contracts with limited transaction histories. Notably, InvSol achieves a 15% improvement in identifying common vulnerabilities compared to InvCon+ and is able to address certain crucial vulnerabilities using specific invariant templates, better than Trace2Inv.

Abstract: Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have transformed organizational structures by shifting from traditional hierarchical control to decentralized approaches, leveraging blockchain and cryptoeconomics. Despite managing significant funds and building global networks, DAOs face challenges like declining participation, increasing centralization, and inabilities to adapt to changing environments, which stifle innovation. This paper explores DAOs as complex systems and applies complexity science to explain their inefficiencies. In particular, we discuss DAO challenges, their complex nature, and introduce the self-organization mechanisms of collective intelligence, digital democracy, and adaptation. By applying these mechansims to improve DAO design and construction, a practical design framework for DAOs is created. This contribution lays a foundation for future research at the intersection of complexity science and DAOs.

Abstract: Federated learning is a new approach to distributed machine learning that offers potential advantages such as reducing communication requirements and distributing the costs of training algorithms. Therefore, it could hold great promise in swarm robotics applications. However, federated learning usually requires a centralized server for the aggregation of the models. In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept implementation of federated learning in a robot swarm that does not compromise decentralization. To do so, we use blockchain technology to enable our robot swarm to securely synchronize a shared model that is the aggregation of the individual models without relying on a central server. We then show that introducing a single malfunctioning robot can, however, heavily disrupt the training process. To prevent such situations, we devise protection mechanisms that are implemented through secure and tamper-proof blockchain smart contracts. Our experiments are conducted in ARGoS, a physics-based simulator for swarm robotics, using the Ethereum blockchain protocol which is executed by each simulated robot.

<br />
<br />总结:

本文研究了零知识证明（ZKPs）领域中的关键组件——特别是简洁非交互性知识论证（SNARKs）——以及与区块链相关的ZK友好哈希函数。随着ZK技术的发展，对各种ZK工具进行基准测试已成为一项有价值的任务。文章着重于评估这些算法在ZK电路中的表现，并通过“批处理”策略来优化成本效率，以解决区块链上的高成本和合规性问题。

文章首先对比了三种SNARK证明系统和五种ZK友好哈希函数的性能，包括自定义的Poseidon2、Neptune和GMiMC电路模板，这些均在bn254曲线的circom-snarkjs框架下进行了测试。此外，引入了一种名为“sequencer”的角色，以提高基于SNARK的隐私保护交易方案的效率，并支持灵活审计。通过实施和评估在以太坊虚拟机兼容链上，研究发现Poseidon和Poseidon2在Groth16下的证明生成阶段展现出更好的内存使用率和运行时间。与基线相比，Poseidon2不仅加快了证明生成速度，而且在以太坊虚拟机链上降低了73%的链上成本，在Hedera链上减少了约26%。

本文为ZK友好哈希函数和ZK工具提供了基准测试，同时也探索了在基于ZKP的隐私保护交易协议中实现成本效益和合规性的可能性。 <div>

Abstract: With the rapid development of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), particularly Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (SNARKs), benchmarking various ZK tools has become a valuable task. ZK-friendly hash functions, as key algorithms in blockchain, have garnered significant attention. Therefore, comprehensive benchmarking and evaluations of these evolving algorithms in ZK circuits present both promising opportunities and challenges. Additionally, we focus on a popular ZKP application, privacy-preserving transaction protocols, aiming to leverage SNARKs' cost-efficiency through "batch processing" to address high on-chain costs and compliance issues.
  To this end, we benchmarked three SNARK proving systems and five ZK-friendly hash functions, including our self-developed circuit templates for Poseidon2, Neptune, and GMiMC, on the bn254 curve within the circom-snarkjs framework. We also introduced the role of "sequencer" in our SNARK-based privacy-preserving transaction scheme to enhance efficiency and enable flexible auditing. We conducted privacy and security analyses, as well as implementation and evaluation on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains. The results indicate that Poseidon and Poseidon2 demonstrate superior memory usage and runtime during proof generation under Groth16. Moreover, compared to the baseline, Poseidon2 not only generates proofs faster but also reduces on-chain costs by 73% on EVM chains and nearly 26% on Hedera. Our work provides a benchmark for ZK-friendly hash functions and ZK tools, while also exploring cost efficiency and compliance in ZKP-based privacy-preserving transaction protocols.

<div> 关键词：物联网（IoT）、室内定位、去中心化、稀疏高斯过程、减少维度输入

总结:

本文提出了一种基于稀疏高斯过程与减少维度输入（SGP-RI）的去中心化物联网（IoT）室内定位模型。该模型通过实时训练，将传统室内定位方法中的离线和在线阶段结合在一起，旨在解决基于集中式服务器的传统室内定位方法所面临的挑战。这些挑战包括数据库无法适应动态多变的室内电磁环境、模型重新训练成本高昂以及集中式服务器容易遭受安全攻击。

SGP-RI模型利用参考点和无线接入点过滤技术减少输入数据的数量和维度，从而以远少于标准高斯过程模型所需训练样本数量的量进行训练，但仍能实现相当的定位性能。实验结果表明，使用SGP-RI模型，即使使用少量的诱导输入样本，也能达到与使用整个训练样本的标准高斯过程模型相媲美的定位效果。

此模型的引入使得室内定位能够分散到资源受限的物联网设备上，提供增强的安全性和隐私保护，降低成本和网络依赖性。同时，其实时训练能力使其能够快速适应不断变化的室内电磁环境。 <div>

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) devices are deployed in the filed, there is an enormous amount of untapped potential in local computing on those IoT devices. Harnessing this potential for indoor localization, therefore, becomes an exciting research area. Conventionally, the training and deployment of indoor localization models are based on centralized servers with substantial computational resources. This centralized approach faces several challenges, including the database's inability to accommodate the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the indoor electromagnetic environment, the model retraining costs, and the susceptibility of centralized servers to security breaches. To mitigate these challenges we aim to amalgamate the offline and online phases of traditional indoor localization methods using a real-time-trainable and decentralized IoT indoor localization model based on Sparse Gaussian Process with Reduced-dimensional Inputs (SGP-RI), where the number and dimension of the input data are reduced through reference point and wireless access point filtering, respectively. The experimental results based on a multi-building and multi-floor static database as well as a single-building and single-floor dynamic database, demonstrate that the proposed SGP-RI model with less than half the training samples as inducing inputs can produce comparable localization performance to the standard Gaussian Process model with the whole training samples. The SGP-RI model enables the decentralization of indoor localization, facilitating its deployment to resource-constrained IoT devices, and thereby could provide enhanced security and privacy, reduced costs, and network dependency. Also, the model's capability of real-time training makes it possible to quickly adapt to the time-varying indoor electromagnetic environment.

<div> 关键词：边缘计算、5G/6G网络、深度学习、压缩感知、生成模型

总结:

本文探讨了在5G/6G等边缘计算网络中，通过无线方式估计用户3D移动能力的关键性，以支持扩展现实（XR）和元宇宙应用。深度学习技术在基于传感器信号（如集成式测量单元(IMU)）的3D人体姿态估计中显示出优于优化方法的优势。然而，现有研究未充分考虑无线系统中传输IMU信号的挑战，以及信号冗余问题导致的高能耗和资源浪费。

针对上述问题，本文提出了一种创新方法，旨在减少IMU信号的冗余并实现轻量级的无线传输。该方法利用随机高斯矩阵将原始信号投影到低维空间中，同时利用压缩感知理论确保在功率传输约束下，设计的高斯矩阵能够保持集限制特征值条件，从而有效降低信号维度而不丢失关键信息。接收端开发了一种深度生成模型，从噪声压缩数据中恢复原始IMU信号，进而实现对用户3D人体动作的创建，满足XR和元宇宙应用需求。

实验结果使用实际IMU数据集验证了方法的有效性，证明仅使用原始信号82%的测量数据，就能达到与优化方法（如Lasso）相当的3D人体姿态精度，但处理速度却快了一个数量级。这表明，本文提出的框架不仅提高了数据传输效率，还保证了精度，为未来XR和元宇宙的应用提供了有力支持。 <div>

Abstract: The ability to estimate 3D movements of users over edge computing-enabled networks, such as 5G/6G networks, is a key enabler for the new era of extended reality (XR) and Metaverse applications. Recent advancements in deep learning have shown advantages over optimization techniques for estimating 3D human poses given spare measurements from sensor signals, i.e., inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors attached to the XR devices. However, the existing works lack applicability to wireless systems, where transmitting the IMU signals over noisy wireless networks poses significant challenges. Furthermore, the potential redundancy of the IMU signals has not been considered, resulting in highly redundant transmissions. In this work, we propose a novel approach for redundancy removal and lightweight transmission of IMU signals over noisy wireless environments. Our approach utilizes a random Gaussian matrix to transform the original signal into a lower-dimensional space. By leveraging the compressive sensing theory, we have proved that the designed Gaussian matrix can project the signal into a lower-dimensional space and preserve the Set-Restricted Eigenvalue condition, subject to a power transmission constraint. Furthermore, we develop a deep generative model at the receiver to recover the original IMU signals from noisy compressed data, thus enabling the creation of 3D human body movements at the receiver for XR and Metaverse applications. Simulation results on a real-world IMU dataset show that our framework can achieve highly accurate 3D human poses of the user using only $82\%$ of the measurements from the original signals. This is comparable to an optimization-based approach, i.e., Lasso, but is an order of magnitude faster.

总结:
本文提出了一种创新的双链区块链数据结构，旨在显著提升区块链性能并确保单一无分叉的链。通过引入“可退还税收证明”（PoRT）共识算法，该方案构建了高度可靠、高效、公平和稳定的区块链操作环境。PoRT算法利用可验证随机函数而非挖矿来选择未来区块维护者，其概率与参与者个人的可退还税收成正比，有效防止了Sybil攻击。同时，通过从维护者可退还税收中扣除区块完成奖励，该系统维持了财富分配的稳定，避免了“富者越富”的问题。研究团队已成功实现并测试了这一方法，结果非常乐观。 <div>

Abstract: In this paper we propose a double-linked blockchain data structure that greatly improves blockchain performance and guarantees single chain with no forks. Additionally, with the proposed proof-of-refundable-tax (PoRT) consensus algorithm, our approach can construct highly reliable, efficient, fair and stable blockchain operations. The PoRT algorithm adopts a verifiable random function instead of mining to select future block maintainers with the probability proportional to each participant's personal refundable tax. The individual refundable tax serves as an index of the activeness of participation and hence PoRT can effectively prevent Sybil attacks. Also, with the block-completion reward deducted from each maintainer's refundable tax, our blockchain system maintains a stable wealth distribution and avoids the "rich become richer" problem. We have implemented the approach and tested with very promising results.

Abstract: In this work, we perform a longitudinal analysis of the BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum blockchain from their inception to March 2022. We study the ecosystem of the tokens and liquidity pools, highlighting analogies and differences between the two blockchains. We discover that about 60% of tokens are active for less than one day. Moreover, we find that 1% of addresses create an anomalous number of tokens (between 20% and 25%). We discover that these tokens are used as disposable tokens to perform a particular type of rug pull, which we call 1-day rug pull. We quantify the presence of this operation on both blockchains discovering its prevalence on the BNB Smart Chain. We estimate that 1-day rug pulls generated $240 million in profits. Finally, we present sniper bots, a new kind of trader bot involved in these activities, and we detect their presence and quantify their activity in the rug pull operations.

Abstract: The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market in the Ethereum blockchain experienced explosive growth in 2021, with a monthly trade volume reaching \$6 billion in January 2022. However, concerns have emerged about possible wash trading, a form of market manipulation in which one party repeatedly trades an NFT to inflate its volume artificially. Our research examines the effects of wash trading on the NFT market in Ethereum from the beginning until January 2022, using multiple approaches. We find that wash trading affects 5.66% of all NFT collections, with a total artificial volume of \$3,406,110,774. We look at two ways to profit from wash trading: Artificially increasing the price of the NFT and taking advantage of the token reward systems provided by some marketplaces. Our findings show that exploiting the token reward systems of NFTMs is much more profitable (mean gain of successful operations is \$1.055M on LooksRare), more likely to succeed (more than 80% of operations), and less risky than reselling an NFT at a higher price using wash trading (50% of activities result in a loss). Our research highlights that wash trading is frequent in Ethereum and that NFTMs should implement protective mechanisms to stop such illicit behavior.

<div> 关键词：拍卖设计、分散式通信、策略证明、可信度、强正相关性

<br /><br />
总结:

本文探讨了在去中心化的通信环境下设计拍卖机制的问题。主要关注于利用不可审查广播信道（如公共区块链）进行通信的场景。与传统机制设计框架不同的是，这里通信不是由拍卖人集中控制，而是通过分散式的渠道实现。这种模型允许设计出比传统框架下更广泛的可信拍卖机制，因为拍卖人无法删除、延迟或修改合法竞买者的信息，从而削弱了其操纵能力。

文章的主要贡献包括：

1. 提出了一种仅在通信分散的情况下才具有可信性的拍卖实例。
2. 构建了一个两轮的拍卖机制，该机制同时具备可信性、策略证明和当竞买者估值呈现$\alpha$-强正相关性（$\alpha > 0$）时达到最优性。
3. 实现这些结果的前提条件相对宽松，包括存在广播通道和加密承诺等基本假设。

通过这些研究成果，作者揭示了分散式通信在设计拍卖机制中的重要性和潜在优势，特别是在对抗可能存在的拍卖人策略行为方面。 <div>

Abstract: We study auction design in a setting where agents can communicate over a censorship-resistant broadcast channel like the ones we can implement over a public blockchain. We seek to design credible, strategyproof auctions in a model that differs from the traditional mechanism design framework because communication is not centralized via the auctioneer. We prove this allows us to design a larger class of credible auctions where the auctioneer has no incentive to be strategic. Intuitively, a decentralized communication model weakens the auctioneer's adversarial capabilities because they can only inject messages into the communication channel but not delete, delay, or modify the messages from legitimate buyers. Our main result is a separation in the following sense: we give the first instance of an auction that is credible only if communication is decentralized. Moreover, we construct the first two-round auction that is credible, strategyproof, and optimal when bidder valuations are $\alpha$-strongly regular, for $\alpha > 0$. Our result relies on mild assumptions -- namely, the existence of a broadcast channel and cryptographic commitments.

Fiber communication lines and satellite-to-ground links have served as the basis for the most successful quantum networks that have been developed so far. Using a UAV, satellite or both for free-space quantum communication reduces the need for permanent ground connections and takes advantage of the lower loss limit in space, which makes it more efficient. This work surveys the recent development in Quantum Satellites and Quantum UAVs-based networks. Here, the importance of the latest technologies, including quantum artificial intelligence, blockchain quantum machine learning, quantum satellites and quantum UAVs, are explored from network perspectives. Further, this work discussed the role of satellite-based images and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Active traffic management with autonomous vehicles offers the potential for reduced congestion and improved traffic flow. However, developing effective algorithms for real-world scenarios requires overcoming challenges related to infinite-horizon traffic flow and partial observability. To address these issues and further decentralize traffic management, we propose an asymmetric actor-critic model that learns decentralized cooperative driving policies for autonomous vehicles using single-agent reinforcement learning. By employing attention neural networks with masking, our approach efficiently manages real-world traffic dynamics and partial observability, eliminating the need for predefined agents or agent-specific experience buffers in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Extensive evaluations across various traffic scenarios demonstrate our method's significant potential in improving traffic flow at critical bottleneck points. Moreover, we address the challenges posed by conservative autonomous vehicle driving behaviors that adhere strictly to traffic rules, showing that our cooperative policy effectively alleviates potential slowdowns without compromising safety.

Abstract: Supply chain data management faces challenges in traceability, transparency, and trust. These issues stem from data silos and communication barriers. This research introduces DIDChain, a framework leveraging blockchain technology, Decentralized Identifiers, and the InterPlanetary File System. DIDChain improves supply chain data management. To address privacy concerns, DIDChain employs a hybrid blockchain architecture that combines public blockchain transparency with the control of private systems. Our hybrid approach preserves the authenticity and reliability of supply chain events. It also respects the data privacy requirements of the participants in the supply chain. Central to DIDChain is the cheqd infrastructure. The cheqd infrastructure enables digital tracing of asset events, such as an asset moving from the milk-producing dairy farm to the cheese manufacturer. In this research, assets are raw materials and products. The cheqd infrastructure ensures the traceability and reliability of assets in the management of supply chain data. Our contribution to blockchain-enabled supply chain systems demonstrates the robustness of DIDChain. Integrating blockchain technology through DIDChain offers a solution to data silos and communication barriers. With DIDChain, we propose a framework to transform the supply chain infrastructure across industries.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the emergence of decentralized Clinical Trials (DCTs) due to patient retention, accelerate trials, improve data accessibility, enable virtual care, and facilitate seamless communication through integrated systems. However, integrating systems in DCTs exposes clinical data to potential security threats, making them susceptible to theft at any stage, a high risk of protocol deviations, and monitoring issues. To mitigate these challenges, blockchain technology serves as a secure framework, acting as a decentralized ledger, creating an immutable environment by establishing a zero-trust architecture, where data are deemed untrusted until verified. In combination with Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled wearable devices, blockchain secures the transfer of clinical trial data on private blockchains during DCT automation and operations. This paper proposes a prototype model of the Zero-Trust Architecture Blockchain (z-TAB) to integrate patient-generated clinical trial data during DCT operation management. The EigenTrust-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (T-PBFT) algorithm has been incorporated as a consensus protocol, leveraging Hyperledger Fabric. Furthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been integrated to streamline data processing among stakeholders within the blockchain platforms. Rigorous evaluation has been done to evaluate the quality of the system.

Abstract: Product lifecycle tracing is increasingly in the focus of regulators and producers, as shown with the initiative of the Digital Product Pass. Likewise, new methods of counterfeit detection are developed that are, e.g., based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). In order to ensure trust and integrity of product lifecycle data, multiple existing supply chain tracing systems are built on blockchain technology. However, only few solutions employ secure identifiers such as PUFs. Furthermore, existing systems that publish the data of individual products, in part fully transparently, have a detrimental impact on scalability and the privacy of users.

<div> 关键词：Federated Learning、Variational Autoencoders（VAEs）、非IID数据、FissionVAE、生成质量

总结:
本文研究了联邦学习在非独立同分布（non-IID）数据环境下的应用，特别是针对不同类别的图像。通过引入一种名为FissionVAE的新方法，该文提出了解决非IID数据带来的挑战，尤其是保持一致的潜在空间和避免不同纹理特征的本地生成器在聚合过程中混合的问题。FissionVAE通过分解潜在空间并为每个客户端群体构建定制的解码分支，实现了与各群体独特数据分布相匹配的学习。此外，文章还探讨了层次化VAE架构的应用，并展示了在FissionVAE中使用异构解码架构的可能性。为了评估该方法的效果，作者创建了两个复合数据集，包括混合的MNIST和FashionMNIST数据以及不同类型的RGB图像。实验结果显示，FissionVAE在这些数据集上的生成质量显著优于传统的联邦VAE模型。

通过将数据集分为多个类别并设计相应的解码分支，FissionVAE能够更好地适应不同数据分布的特点，从而提高生成图像的质量。这种方法不仅适用于非IID数据环境，还能增强联邦学习在复杂多样的图像生成任务中的应用能力。 <div>

Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm that enables decentralized clients to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping all the training data local. While considerable research has focused on federated image generation, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders have received less attention. In this paper, we address the challenges of non-IID (independently and identically distributed) data environments featuring multiple groups of images of different types. Specifically, heterogeneous data distributions can lead to difficulties in maintaining a consistent latent space and can also result in local generators with disparate texture features being blended during aggregation. We introduce a novel approach, FissionVAE, which decomposes the latent space and constructs decoder branches tailored to individual client groups. This method allows for customized learning that aligns with the unique data distributions of each group. Additionally, we investigate the incorporation of hierarchical VAE architectures and demonstrate the use of heterogeneous decoder architectures within our model. We also explore strategies for setting the latent prior distributions to enhance the decomposition process. To evaluate our approach, we assemble two composite datasets: the first combines MNIST and FashionMNIST; the second comprises RGB datasets of cartoon and human faces, wild animals, marine vessels, and remote sensing images of Earth. Our experiments demonstrate that FissionVAE greatly improves generation quality on these datasets compared to baseline federated VAE models.

总结:本文提出了一种结合多因素的身份认证方法，旨在确保AI驱动的化身与其原始操作者的可追溯性。首先，构建用户身份模型，融合操纵者虹膜特征和AI代理的公钥，以确保AI驱动的化身与原操纵者关联。其次，引入一种支持原始操作者将签名能力委托给AI代理的雪人代理签名方案。最后，设计基于身份模型和雪人代理签名的三种认证协议，确保包括人类驱动和AI驱动化身在内的虚拟到物理的可追溯性。安全分析显示，该签名方案具有不可伪造性，认证方法能够抵御虚假指控。广泛的评估表明，设计的认证协议能够在约1秒内完成用户登录、化身委托、相互认证和化身追踪等操作，满足实际应用需求，并有助于减轻由AI驱动的化身引发的假冒攻击。 <div>

Abstract: Metaverse allows users to delegate their AI models to an AI engine, which builds corresponding AI-driven avatars to provide immersive experience for other users. Since current authentication methods mainly focus on human-driven avatars and ignore the traceability of AI-driven avatars, attackers may delegate the AI models of a target user to an AI proxy program to perform impersonation attacks without worrying about being detected.
  In this paper, we propose an authentication method using multi-factors to guarantee the traceability of AI-driven avatars. Firstly, we construct a user's identity model combining the manipulator's iris feature and the AI proxy's public key to ensure that an AI-driven avatar is associated with its original manipulator. Secondly, we propose a chameleon proxy signature scheme that supports the original manipulator to delegate his/her signing ability to an AI proxy. Finally, we design three authentication protocols for avatars based on the identity model and the chameleon proxy signature to guarantee the virtual-to-physical traceability including both the human-driven and AI-driven avatars.
  Security analysis shows that the proposed signature scheme is unforgeability and the authentication method is able to defend against false accusation. Extensive evaluations show that the designed authentication protocols complete user login, avatar delegation, mutual authentication, and avatar tracing in about 1s, meeting the actual application needs and helping to mitigate impersonation attacks by AI-driven avatars.

<div> 关键词：链接遍历查询、完整性、执行时间、超媒体控制词汇、链接修剪

总结:

本文主要探讨了链接遍历查询中的挑战，特别是由于网络规模导致的不完整性和长时间执行问题。传统的解决方法通过可达性标准来定义完整性，限制查询引擎遵循的链接数量，但这并未解决根本问题——即需要处理的链接数量仍然庞大。文章提出了一种基于规则的可达性标准，该标准能够捕捉链接数据文档中表示的逻辑语句，从而帮助精简无关的资源来源。

该策略通过修改Comunica链接遍历引擎，使其能够从超媒体控制词汇中获取提示，进一步优化链接修剪过程。实验结果表明，采用这种方法可以显著减少HTTP请求次数和查询执行时间，同时不影响结果的完整性。这表明研究链接修剪中对超媒体控制的利用，对于优化未索引的去中心化数据库的网络查询具有重要意义。 <div>

Abstract: Link Traversal queries face challenges in completeness and long execution time due to the size of the web. Reachability criteria define completeness by restricting the links followed by engines. However, the number of links to dereference remains the bottleneck of the approach. Web environments often have structures exploitable by query engines to prune irrelevant sources. Current criteria rely on using information from the query definition and predefined predicate. However, it is difficult to use them to traverse environments where logical expressions indicate the location of resources. We propose to use a rule-based reachability criterion that captures logical statements expressed in hypermedia descriptions within linked data documents to prune irrelevant sources. In this poster paper, we show how the Comunica link traversal engine is modified to take hints from a hypermedia control vocabulary, to prune irrelevant sources. Our preliminary findings show that by using this strategy, the query engine can significantly reduce the number of HTTP requests and the query execution time without sacrificing the completeness of results. Our work shows that the investigation of hypermedia controls in link pruning of traversal queries is a worthy effort for optimizing web queries of unindexed decentralized databases.

Abstract: The supply chain is a critical segment of the product manufacturing cycle, continuously influenced by risky, uncertain, and undesirable events. Optimizing flexibility in the supply chain presents a complex, multi-objective, and nonlinear programming challenge. In the poultry supply chain, the development of mass customization capabilities has led manufacturing companies to increasingly focus on offering tailored and customized services for individual products. To safeguard against data tampering and ensure the integrity of setup costs and overall profitability, a multi-signature decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, integrated with the IoT on a blockchain platform, is proposed. Managing the poultry supply chain involves uncertainties that may not account for parameters such as delivery time to retailers, reorder time, and the number of requested products. To address these challenges, this study employs an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), combining neural networks with fuzzy logic to compensate for the lack of data training in parameter identification. Through MATLAB simulations, the study investigates the average shop delivery duration, the reorder time, and the number of products per order. By implementing the proposed technique, the average delivery time decreases from 40 to 37 minutes, the reorder time decreases from five to four days, and the quantity of items requested per order grows from six to eleven. Additionally, the ANFIS model enhances overall supply chain performance by reducing transaction times by 15\% compared to conventional systems, thereby improving real-time responsiveness and boosting transparency in supply chain operations, effectively resolving operational issues.

Abstract: The popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven its usage in our homes and industries over the past 10-12 years. However, there have been some major issues related to identity management and ownership transfer involving IoT devices, particularly for consumer IoT devices, e. g. smart appliances such as smart TVs, smart refrigerators, and so on. There have been a few attempts to address this issue; however, user-centric and effective ownership and identity management of IoT devices have not been very successful so far. Recently, blockchain technology has been used to address these issues with limited success. This article presents a Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) based system that facilitates a secure and user-centric ownership management and transfer of consumer IoT devices. The system leverages a number of emerging technologies, such as blockchain and decentralized identifiers (DID), verifiable credentials (VC), under the umbrella of SSI. We present the architecture of the system based on a threat model and requirement analysis, discuss the implementation of a Proof-of-Concept based on the proposed system and illustrate a number of use-cases with their detailed protocol flows. Furthermore, we analyse its security using ProVerif, a state-of-the art protocol verification tool and examine its performance.

Abstract: Accurate electricity demand forecasting is essential for several reasons, especially as the integration of renewable energy sources and the transition to a decentralized network paradigm introduce greater complexity and uncertainty. The proposed methodology leverages graph-based representations to effectively capture the spatial distribution and relational intricacies inherent in this decentralized network structure. This research work offers a novel approach that extends beyond the conventional Generalized Additive Model framework by considering models like Graph Convolutional Networks or Graph SAGE. These graph-based models enable the incorporation of various levels of interconnectedness and information sharing among nodes, where each node corresponds to the combined load (i.e. consumption) of a subset of consumers (e.g. the regions of a country). More specifically, we introduce a range of methods for inferring graphs tailored to consumption forecasting, along with a framework for evaluating the developed models in terms of both performance and explainability. We conduct experiments on electricity forecasting, in both a synthetic and a real framework considering the French mainland regions, and the performance and merits of our approach are discussed.

Abstract: The remarkable growth of digital assets, starting from the inception of Bitcoin in 2009 into a 1 trillion market in 2024, underscores the momentum behind disruptive technologies and the global appetite for digital assets. This paper develops a framework to enhance actuaries' understanding of the cyber risks associated with the developing digital asset ecosystem, as well as their measurement methods in the context of digital asset insurance. By integrating actuarial perspectives, we aim to enhance understanding and modeling of cyber risks at both the micro and systemic levels. The qualitative examination sheds light on blockchain technology and its associated risks, while our quantitative framework offers a rigorous approach to modeling cyber risks in digital asset insurance portfolios. This multifaceted approach serves three primary objectives: i) offer a clear and accessible education on the evolving digital asset ecosystem and the diverse spectrum of cyber risks it entails; ii) develop a scientifically rigorous framework for quantifying cyber risks in the digital asset ecosystem; iii) provide practical applications, including pricing strategies and tail risk management. Particularly, we develop frequency-severity models based on real loss data for pricing cyber risks in digit assets and utilize Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the tail risks, offering practical insights for risk management strategies. As digital assets continue to reshape finance, our work serves as a foundational step towards safeguarding the integrity and stability of this rapidly evolving landscape.

总结:

本文主要探讨了Federated Learning（FL）领域的一个关键问题——如何在保证模型性能的同时，提高在非独立同分布数据下的模型收敛率，并减少隐私泄漏的风险。针对这一挑战，作者提出了FedAgg算法，一种通过改进传统的随机梯度下降方法来实现的自适应Federated学习策略。

首先，FedAgg算法引入了聚合梯度的概念，旨在减少本地模型参数与全局平均模型之间的差异，从而加速模型的收敛过程。同时，该算法通过动态调整学习率，进一步优化了训练效率，使得模型能够更快速地达到最优解。

其次，考虑到在FL中信息交换可能导致的数据泄露风险，作者设计了两个平均场项，用于近似计算每个客户端在不同时间点的平均局部参数和梯度。这不仅有助于减轻信息交换对隐私的影响，还为每个客户端提供了一个自适应的学习率，使系统能够根据当前状态灵活调整训练速度。

最后，理论分析表明，FedAgg算法在理论上是可行的，其收敛性得到了证明，并给出了一个关于算法收敛速度的上界。实验结果则验证了该算法在同分布和非同分布数据集上的有效性，相较于现有的先进FL策略，FedAgg算法在提升模型性能和加快收敛速度方面表现出明显优势。 <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a crucial distributed training paradigm, enabling discrete devices to collaboratively train a shared model under the coordination of a central server, while leveraging their locally stored private data. Nonetheless, the non-independent-and-identically-distributed (Non-IID) data generated on heterogeneous clients and the incessant information exchange among participants may significantly impede training efficacy, retard the model convergence rate and increase the risk of privacy leakage. To alleviate the divergence between the local and average model parameters and obtain a fast model convergence rate, we propose an adaptive FEDerated learning algorithm called FedAgg by refining the conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methodology with an AGgregated Gradient term at each local training epoch and adaptively adjusting the learning rate based on a penalty term that quantifies the local model deviation. To tackle the challenge of information exchange among clients during local training and design a decentralized adaptive learning rate for each client, we introduce two mean-field terms to approximate the average local parameters and gradients over time. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the existence and convergence of the mean-field terms and provide a robust upper bound on the convergence of our proposed algorithm. The extensive experimental results on real-world datasets substantiate the superiority of our framework in comparison with existing state-of-the-art FL strategies for enhancing model performance and accelerating convergence rate under IID and Non-IID datasets.

Abstract: Existing blockchain networks are often large-scale, requiring transactions to be synchronized across the entire network to reach consensus. On-chain computations can be prohibitively expensive, making many CPU-intensive computations infeasible. Inspired by the structure of IBM's token ring networks, we propose a lightweight consensus protocol called Monadring to address these issues. Monadring allows nodes within a large blockchain network to form smaller subnetworks, enabling faster and more cost-effective computations while maintaining the security guarantees of the main blockchain network.
  To further enhance Monadring's security, we introduce a node rotation mechanism based on Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and blind voting using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) within the smaller subnetwork. Unlike the common voting-based election of validator nodes, Monadring leverages FHE to conceal voting information, eliminating the advantage of the last mover in the voting process.
  This paper details the design and implementation of the Monadring protocol and evaluates its performance and feasibility through simulation experiments. Our research contributes to enhancing the practical utility of blockchain technology in large-scale application scenarios.

本文聚焦于合作多智能体系统中的集中训练与分散执行（CTDE）模式，指出该模式下智能体间行动分歧是提高训练效率的主要障碍。这种分歧源于智能体在CTDE过程中的信用分配阶段缺乏足够的团队共识相关指导信号。为解决这一问题，作者提出了一种名为“内在行动倾向一致性”的新方法，用于协同多智能体强化学习。

Abstract: Efficient collaboration in the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm remains a challenge in cooperative multi-agent systems. We identify divergent action tendencies among agents as a significant obstacle to CTDE's training efficiency, requiring a large number of training samples to achieve a unified consensus on agents' policies. This divergence stems from the lack of adequate team consensus-related guidance signals during credit assignments in CTDE. To address this, we propose Intrinsic Action Tendency Consistency, a novel approach for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. It integrates intrinsic rewards, obtained through an action model, into a reward-additive CTDE (RA-CTDE) framework. We formulate an action model that enables surrounding agents to predict the central agent's action tendency. Leveraging these predictions, we compute a cooperative intrinsic reward that encourages agents to match their actions with their neighbors' predictions. We establish the equivalence between RA-CTDE and CTDE through theoretical analyses, demonstrating that CTDE's training process can be achieved using agents' individual targets. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel method to combine intrinsic rewards and CTDE. Extensive experiments on challenging tasks in SMAC and GRF benchmarks showcase the improved performance of our method.

Abstract: With the development of blockchain technology, the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities is increasingly emphasized. However, when detecting vulnerabilities in inter-contract interactions (i.e., cross-contract vulnerabilities) using smart contract bytecode, existing tools often produce many false positives and false negatives due to insufficient recovery of semantic information and inadequate consideration of contract dependencies. We present CrossInspector, a novel framework for detecting cross-contract vulnerabilities at the bytecode level through static analysis. CrossInspector utilizes a trained Transformer model to recover semantic information and considers control flow, data flow, and dependencies related to smart contract state variables to construct a state dependency graph for fine-grained inter-procedural analysis. Additionally, CrossInspector incorporates a pruning method and two parallel optimization mechanisms to accelerate the vulnerability detection process. Experiments on our manually constructed dataset demonstrate that CrossInspector outperforms the state-of-the-art tools in both precision (97\%) and recall (96.75\%), while also significantly reducing the overall time from 16.34 seconds to 7.83 seconds, almost on par with the fastest tool that utilizes bytecode for detection. Additionally, we ran CrossInspector on a randomly selected set of 300 real-world smart contracts and identified 11 cross-contract vulnerabilities that were missed by prior tools.

Abstract: The pervasive adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly advanced healthcare digitization and modernization. Nevertheless, the sensitive nature of medical data presents security and privacy challenges. On the other hand, resource constraints of IoT devices often necessitates cloud services for data handling, introducing single points of failure, processing delays, and security vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, the blockchain technology offers potential solutions for enhancing security, decentralization, and data ownership. An ideal solution should ensure confidentiality, access control, and data integrity while being scalable, cost-effective, and integrable with the existing systems. However, current blockchain-based studies only address some of these requirements. Accordingly, this paper proposes EdgeLinker; a comprehensive solution incorporating Proof-of-Authority consensus, integrating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for access control, and advanced cryptographic algorithms for secure data communication between IoT edge devices and the fog layer in healthcare fog applications. This novel framework has been implemented in a real-world fog testbed, using COTS fog devices. Based on a comprehensive set of evaluations, EdgeLinker demonstrates significant improvements in security and privacy with reasonable costs, making it an affordable and practical system for healthcare fog applications. Compared with the state-of-the-art, without significant changes in the write-time to the blockchain, EdgeLinker achieves a 35% improvement in data read time. Additionally, it is able to provide better throughput in both reading and writing transactions compared to the existing studies. EdgeLinker has been also examined in terms of energy, resource consumption and channel latency in both secure and non-secure modes, which has shown remarkable improvements.

Abstract: Large language models have significantly transformed multiple fields with their exceptional performance in natural language tasks, but their deployment in resource-constrained environments like edge networks presents an ongoing challenge. Decentralized techniques for inference have emerged, distributing the model blocks among multiple devices to improve flexibility and cost effectiveness. However, energy limitations remain a significant concern for edge devices. We propose a sustainable model for collaborative inference on interconnected, battery-powered edge devices with energy harvesting. A semi-Markov model is developed to describe the states of the devices, considering processing parameters and average green energy arrivals. This informs the design of scheduling algorithms that aim to minimize device downtimes and maximize network throughput. Through empirical evaluations and simulated runs, we validate the effectiveness of our approach, paving the way for energy-efficient decentralized inference over edge networks.

总结:
本文提出了一种基于模糊聚类的新型异常检测方法，专门用于EDFA系统的泵电流时间序列。该方法通过结合熵分析（EA）和主成分分析（PCA）的优势，以及模糊聚类过程，形成了一种创新的框架——变化检测框架（CDF）。通过EA动态选择特征以减少特征空间并提高计算性能，PCA则从原始特征空间中提取特征，以增强后续模糊聚类过程的泛化能力。

本文评估了三种不同的模糊聚类方法：模糊聚类算法、概率聚类算法和可能性聚类算法，以比较它们的性能和泛化能力。与商业使用的EDFA中预先定义的警报不同，该框架能够早于任意操作点检测泵电流时间序列的变化。此外，该框架通过实验数据进行了实现和测试，并为进一步的光缆网络分散式预测性维护提供了可能途径。

该方法不仅提高了EDFA系统异常检测的精度和效率，还为光缆网络的预测性维护提供了一种新的策略，有助于提升网络的稳定性和可靠性。 <div>

Abstract: This article proposes a novel fuzzy clustering based anomaly detection method for pump current time series of EDFA systems. The proposed change detection framework (CDF) strategically combines the advantages of entropy analysis (EA) and principle component analysis (PCA) with fuzzy clustering procedures. In the framework, EA is applied for dynamic selection of features for reduction of the feature space and increase of computational performance. Furthermore, PCA is utilized to extract features from the raw feature space to enable generalization capability of the subsequent fuzzy clustering procedures. Three different fuzzy clustering methods, more precisely the fuzzy clustering algorithm, a probabilistic clustering algorithm and a possibilistic clustering algorithm are evaluated for performance and generalization. Hence, the proposed framework has the innovative feature to detect changes in pump current time series at an early stage for arbitrary points of operation, compared to state-of-the-art predefined alarms in commercially used EDFAs. Moreover, the approach is implemented and tested using experimental data. In addition, the proposed framework enables further approaches of applying decentralized predictive maintenance for optical fiber networks.

总结:

本文介绍了一种名为“Chop Chop”的新型拜占庭原子广播系统。该系统利用一种创新的认证内存池技术，实现了对消息的快速排序、验证和去重，即便处理小至8字节的消息也能达到“线速率”，即与无任何排序、验证或拜占庭容错性的协议相比，其复杂度几乎相同。Chop Chop通过一种称为“蒸馏”的新型批量处理方式实现这一目标，即创建一组易于认证、去重和排序的消息集合。

在一项地理分布式的部署中，包含64台中型服务器的情况下，Chop Chop每秒可处理高达4360万条消息，平均延迟为3.6秒。相比之下，当前最佳替代方案在同一条件下只能提供相同延迟下的处理能力，仅为Chop Chop的十分之一。此外，文章还展示了Chop Chop在支付系统、拍卖平台和像素战争游戏等三个简单应用中的实际表现，分别实现了32、2.3和35百万次操作/秒的性能。 <div>

Abstract: At the heart of state machine replication, the celebrated technique enabling decentralized and secure universal computation, lies Atomic Broadcast, a fundamental communication primitive that orders, authenticates, and deduplicates messages. This paper presents Chop Chop, a Byzantine Atomic Broadcast system that uses a novel authenticated memory pool to amortize the cost of ordering, authenticating and deduplicating messages, achieving "line rate" (i.e., closely matching the complexity of a protocol that does not ensure any ordering, authentication or Byzantine resilience) even when processing messages as small as 8 bytes. Chop Chop attains this performance by means of a new form of batching we call distillation. A distilled batch is a set of messages that are fast to authenticate, deduplicate, and order. Batches are distilled using a novel interactive protocol involving brokers, an untrusted layer of facilitating processes between clients and servers. In a geo-distributed deployment of 64 medium-sized servers, Chop Chop processes 43,600,000 messages per second with an average latency of 3.6 seconds. Under the same conditions, state-of-the-art alternatives offer two orders of magnitude less throughput for the same latency. We showcase three simple Chop Chop applications: a Payment system, an Auction house and a "Pixel war" game, respectively achieving 32, 2.3 and 35 million operations per second.

Abstract: With the surge in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, illegal mining for cryptocurrency has become a popular cyberthreat. Host-based cryptojacking, where malicious actors exploit victims systems to mine cryptocurrency without their knowledge, is on the rise. Regular cryptojacking is relatively well-known and well-studied threat, however, recently attackers started switching to GPU cryptojacking, which promises greater profits due to high GPU hash rates and lower detection chance. Additionally, GPU cryptojackers can easily propagate using, for example, modified graphic card drivers. This article considers question of GPU cryptojacking detection. First, we discuss brief history and definition of GPU cryptojacking as well as previous attempts to design a detection technique for such threats. We also propose complex exposure mechanism based on GPU load by an application and graphic card RAM consumption, which can be used to detect both browser-based and host-based cryptojacking samples. Then we design a prototype decision tree detection program based on our technique. It was tested in a controlled virtual machine environment with 80% successful detection rate against selected set of GPU cryptojacking samples and 20% false positive rate against selected number of legitimate GPU-heavy applications.

总结:

本文探讨了集中式训练与分散式执行在多智能体强化学习（MARL）中的应用，其中智能体在离线阶段以集中式方式训练，而在在线执行阶段则以分散式方式操作。特别地，研究了利用集中式批评家的方法，该批评家能够访问整个系统的真实状态信息。尽管此类方法在多个领域表现出色并成为MARL的标准实践，但集中式批评家的使用在理论上和实践中尚未得到充分分析。

文章首先对比了集中式与分散式批评家策略，以及在部分可观测环境中的状态值与历史值批评家的使用。理论分析揭示了与直觉相反的结果：集中式批评家并非绝对有益，反而可能引入意外的偏差和方差问题。特别是，状态值批评家可能会导致与基于历史的批评家相比出现不可预测的问题。

为了验证理论分析的实际影响，作者通过比较不同形式的批评家在广泛多智能体基准上的表现进行了实验。结果表明，特别是在部分可观测性环境中，代表学习的难度增加了理论问题的复杂性，这解释了为什么这些问题在文献中往往被忽视。 <div>

Abstract: Centralized Training for Decentralized Execution where agents are trained offline in a centralized fashion and execute online in a decentralized manner, has become a popular approach in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In particular, it has become popular to develop actor-critic methods that train decentralized actors with a centralized critic where the centralized critic is allowed access global information of the entire system, including the true system state. Such centralized critics are possible given offline information and are not used for online execution. While these methods perform well in a number of domains and have become a de facto standard in MARL, using a centralized critic in this context has yet to be sufficiently analyzed theoretically or empirically. In this paper, we therefore formally analyze centralized and decentralized critic approaches, and analyze the effect of using state-based critics in partially observable environments. We derive theories contrary to the common intuition: critic centralization is not strictly beneficial, and using state values can be harmful. We further prove that, in particular, state-based critics can introduce unexpected bias and variance compared to history-based critics. Finally, we demonstrate how the theory applies in practice by comparing different forms of critics on a wide range of common multi-agent benchmarks. The experiments show practical issues such as the difficulty of representation learning with partial observability, which highlights why the theoretical problems are often overlooked in the literature.

<div> 关键词：智能合约安全、交易恶意检测、实时验证、读取交易痕迹、过去时间线性时态逻辑

总结:
本文探讨了智能合约安全领域中的交易恶意检测技术，该技术通过利用交易痕迹的特性来实现对黑客攻击的高度准确识别。然而，这种方法无法在实际操作中即时回滚恶意交易，因此智能合约通常会集成一些可编程的安全特性以增强安全性。但这些可编程的安全特性存在局限性，无法阻止如读取重入等特定类型的攻击。

文章提出了对以太坊虚拟机（EVM）和以太坊客户端进行修改的建议，旨在使智能合约能够实时验证交易痕迹属性，而不会影响传统的EVM执行过程。通过使用过去时间线性时态逻辑（PLTL），可以正式化交易痕迹属性，表明大多数现有的检测指标都可以用PLTL表示。

此外，文章还讨论了所提议修改的潜在影响，强调了它们显著提升智能合约安全性的能力。改进后的系统将允许智能合约实时验证交易行为，从而有效防止特定类型的攻击，提高整体安全性，同时避免了因执行额外验证步骤而导致的高Gas消耗问题。 <div>

Abstract: In the realm of smart contract security, transaction malice detection has been able to leverage properties of transaction traces to identify hacks with high accuracy. However, these methods cannot be applied in real-time to revert malicious transactions. Instead, smart contracts are often instrumented with some safety properties to enhance their security. However, these instrumentable safety properties are limited and fail to block certain types of hacks such as those which exploit read-only re-entrancy. This limitation primarily stems from the Ethereum Virtual Machine's (EVM) inability to allow a smart contract to read transaction traces in real-time. Additionally, these instrumentable safety properties can be gas-intensive, rendering them impractical for on-the-fly validation. To address these challenges, we propose modifications to both the EVM and Ethereum clients, enabling smart contracts to validate these transaction trace properties in real-time without affecting traditional EVM execution. We also use past-time linear temporal logic (PLTL) to formalize transaction trace properties, showcasing that most existing detection metrics can be expressed using PLTL. We also discuss the potential implications of our proposed modifications, emphasizing their capacity to significantly enhance smart contract security.

Abstract: Machine anomalous sound detection (ASD) has emerged as one of the most promising applications in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) due to its unprecedented efficacy in mitigating risks of malfunctions and promoting production efficiency. Previous works mainly investigated the machine ASD task under centralized settings. However, developing the ASD system under decentralized settings is crucial in practice, since the machine data are dispersed in various factories and the data should not be explicitly shared due to privacy concerns. To enable these factories to cooperatively develop a scalable ASD model while preserving their privacy, we propose a novel framework named CoopASD, where each factory trains an ASD model on its local dataset, and a central server aggregates these local models periodically. We employ a pre-trained model as the backbone of the ASD model to improve its robustness and develop specialized techniques to stabilize the model under a completely non-iid and domain shift setting. Compared with previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained in centralized settings, CoopASD showcases competitive results with negligible degradation of 0.08%. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of CoopASD.

总结:

本文研究了多智能体路径规划问题的一个挑战性变种——匿名多智能体路径规划(AMAPF)，即一组智能体必须到达一组目标位置，但关键在于哪个智能体到达特定位置并不重要。当前的最优和次优AMAPF解决方案依赖于中心控制器，负责目标分配和路径查找。文章提出了一种新的方法，即TP-SWAP（目标交换与优先级调整），这是第一个能够以完全分布式方式解决该问题的AMAPF算法，每个智能体独立决策并仅依靠与其他智能体的局部通信。

TP-SWAP的核心是一个针对产生一致目标分配（确保没有两个智能体同时前往同一目标）的优先级和目标交换程序，结合了成熟的规则基路径规划策略。理论证明了TP-SWAP的完备性，即TP-SWAP能够保证每个目标由某个智能体到达。实验结果显示，TP-SWAP在广泛设置下优于现有的完全分布式基准，并且在某些情况下甚至超过了依赖初始一致目标分配的半分布式解决方案，特别是在考虑流时间（MAPF中广泛应用的成本指标）时。 <div>

Abstract: In this paper we study a challenging variant of the multi-agent pathfinding problem (MAPF), when a set of agents must reach a set of goal locations, but it does not matter which agent reaches a specific goal - Anonymous MAPF (AMAPF). Current optimal and suboptimal AMAPF solvers rely on the existence of a centralized controller which is in charge of both target assignment and pathfinding. We extend the state of the art and present the first AMAPF solver capable of solving the problem at hand in a fully decentralized fashion, when each agent makes decisions individually and relies only on the local communication with the others. The core of our method is a priority and target swapping procedure tailored to produce consistent goal assignments (i.e. making sure that no two agents are heading towards the same goal). Coupled with an established rule-based path planning, we end up with a TP-SWAP, an efficient and flexible approach to solve decentralized AMAPF. On the theoretical side, we prove that TP-SWAP is complete (i.e. TP-SWAP guarantees that each target will be reached by some agent). Empirically, we evaluate TP-SWAP across a wide range of setups and compare it to both centralized and decentralized baselines. Indeed, TP-SWAP outperforms the fully-decentralized competitor and can even outperform the semi-decentralized one (i.e. the one relying on the initial consistent goal assignment) in terms of flowtime (a widespread cost objective in MAPF

Abstract: A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a commitment between a client and provider that assures the quality of service (QoS) a client can expect to receive when purchasing a service. However, evidence of SLA violations in Internet of Things (IoT) service monitoring data can be manipulated by the provider or consumer, resulting in an issue of trust between contracted parties. The following research aims to explore the use of blockchain technology in monitoring IoT systems using smart contracts so that SLA violations captured are irrefutable amongst service providers and clients. The research focuses on the development of a Java library that is capable of generating a smart contract from a given SLA. A smart contract generated by this library is validated through a mock scenario presented in the form of a Remote Patient Monitoring IoT system. In this scenario, the findings demonstrate a 100 percent success rate in capturing all emulated violations.

Abstract: We consider the problem of encoding information in a system of N=K+R processors that operate in a decentralized manner, i.e., without a central processor which orchestrates the operation. The system involves K source processors, each holding some data modeled as a vector over a finite field. The remaining R processors are sinks, and each of which requires a linear combination of all data vectors. These linear combinations are distinct from one sink processor to another, and are specified by a generator matrix of a systematic linear error correcting code. To capture the communication cost of decentralized encoding, we adopt a linear network model in which the process proceeds in consecutive communication rounds. In every round, every processor sends and receives one message through each one of its p ports. Moreover, inspired by linear network coding literature, we allow processors to transfer linear combinations of their own data and previously received data. We propose a framework that addresses the decentralized encoding problem on two levels. On the universal level, we provide a solution to the decentralized encoding problem for any possible linear code. On the specific level, we further optimize our solution towards systematic Reed-Solomon codes, as well as their variant, Lagrange codes, for their prevalent use in coded storage and computation systems. Our solutions are based on a newly-defined collective communication operation we call all-to-all encode.

<div> 关键词：联邦学习、Matthew 效应、公平性、性能优化、多目标优化

总结:

本文研究了联邦学习（FL）中的Matthew效应问题，即全球模型性能的不均衡导致数据资源较少的客户端产生更大的数据资源差距。针对这一挑战，作者提出了反Matthew公平性概念，旨在使全球模型在各客户端上具有相同的准确性和决策偏差。为了解决性能优化与公平性之间的权衡问题，文章将反Matthew联邦学习（反Matthew FL）定义为一个多约束多目标优化（MCMOO）问题，并设计了一个三阶段多梯度下降算法来寻找帕累托最优解。

通过理论分析，证明了所提算法的收敛性和时间复杂性。实验结果表明，与现有联邦学习算法相比，提出的反Matthew FL不仅能够构建高性能的全局模型，还能有效缩小客户端之间的性能差距，从而促进数据资源的均衡分配，对提升社会福利有潜在贡献。此工作揭示了在联邦学习等分散式学习场景中Matthew效应的表现，并为设计更公平的学习机制提供了理论依据和实践指导。 <div>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) stands as a paradigmatic approach that facilitates model training across heterogeneous and diverse datasets originating from various data providers. However, conventional FLs fall short of achieving consistent performance, potentially leading to performance degradation for clients who are disadvantaged in data resources. Influenced by the Matthew effect, deploying a performance-imbalanced global model in applications further impedes the generation of high-quality data from disadvantaged clients, exacerbating the disparities in data resources among clients. In this work, we propose anti-Matthew fairness for the global model at the client level, requiring equal accuracy and equal decision bias across clients. To balance the trade-off between achieving anti-Matthew fairness and performance optimality, we formalize the anti-Matthew effect federated learning (anti-Matthew FL) as a multi-constrained multi-objectives optimization (MCMOO) problem and propose a three-stage multi-gradient descent algorithm to obtain the Pareto optimality. We theoretically analyze the convergence and time complexity of our proposed algorithms. Additionally, through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our proposed anti-Matthew FL outperforms other state-of-the-art FL algorithms in achieving a high-performance global model while effectively bridging performance gaps among clients. We hope this work provides valuable insights into the manifestation of the Matthew effect in FL and other decentralized learning scenarios and can contribute to designing fairer learning mechanisms, ultimately fostering societal welfare.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the non-fungible token (NFT) market has catalyzed new opportunities for artists, collectors, and investors, yet it has also unveiled critical challenges related to the storage and distribution of associated metadata. This paper examines the current landscape of NFT metadata storage, revealing a significant reliance on centralized platforms, which poses risks to the integrity, security, and decentralization of these digital assets. Through a detailed analysis of top-selling NFTs on the OpenSea marketplace, it was found that a substantial portion of metadata is hosted on centralized servers, making them susceptible to censorship, data breaches, and administrative alterations. Conversely, decentralized storage solutions, particularly the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), were identified as a more secure and resilient alternative, offering enhanced transparency, resistance to tampering, and greater control for creators and collectors. This study advocates for the widespread adoption of decentralized storage architectures, incorporating digital signatures to verify ownership, as a means to preserve the value and trustworthiness of NFTs in an increasingly digital world. The findings underscore the necessity for NFT platforms to prioritize decentralized methodologies to ensure the long-term sustainability and integrity of the NFT

总结:
本文提出了一种创新的区块链概念——生成式区块链，其核心目标是将交易的生成与记录集成到单一系统中，而非仅专注于记录交易。该理论引入了Proof-of-Merit（PoM）共识机制，旨在为需要解决复杂问题后才能记录交易的企业环境提供解决方案。与当前主要侧重于记录现有交易的共识机制不同，PoM将交易的生成和记录过程融合在一个统一的区块链框架内。

在具体应用层面，文章以即需即行的乘车服务平台为例，演示了PoM机制如何运作。在这个场景中，匹配者（问题解决者）被分配任务来匹配乘客与司机，他们的解决方案根据“功绩”进行评估，最佳方案的提出者负责将交易记录至区块链，并获得相应的奖励。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new paradigm: generative blockchain, which aims to transform conventional blockchain technology by combining transaction generation and recording, rather than focusing solely on transaction recording. Central to our design is a novel consensus mechanism, Proof-of-Merit (PoM), specifically crafted for environments where businesses must solve complex problems before transactions can be recorded. PoM integrates the generation and recording of transactions within a unified blockchain system, fundamentally differing from prevailing consensus mechanisms that primarily record existing transactions. We demonstrate PoM on a ride service on-demand platform, where the task of solving complex transaction-generating problems is delegated to a pool of independent problem solvers. These solvers generate transactions, and their solutions are selected based on merit. The winning solvers then register these transactions onto the blockchain and are rewarded accordingly. We introduce a Decentralized Control Parameter (DCP) to balance two key performance metrics: efficiency and equity. The applicability of our generative blockchain is illustrated through a ridesharing context, where matchers (solvers) are tasked with matching riders to drivers. We demonstrate PoM's performance and nuanced properties using agent-based simulation, exploring how to find the optimal DCP value to achieve a desirable balance of efficiency and equity in a generative blockchain.

Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving multi-task generalization to diverse agents and objectives presents significant challenges. Existing online MARL algorithms primarily focus on single-task performance, but their lack of multi-task generalization capabilities typically results in substantial computational waste and limited real-life applicability. Meanwhile, existing offline multi-task MARL approaches are heavily dependent on data quality, often resulting in poor performance on unseen tasks. In this paper, we introduce HyGen, a novel hybrid MARL framework, Hybrid Training for Enhanced Multi-Task Generalization, which integrates online and offline learning to ensure both multi-task generalization and training efficiency. Specifically, our framework extracts potential general skills from offline multi-task datasets. We then train policies to select the optimal skills under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm (CTDE). During this stage, we utilize a replay buffer that integrates both offline data and online interactions. We empirically demonstrate that our framework effectively extracts and refines general skills, yielding impressive generalization to unseen tasks. Comparative analyses on the StarCraft multi-agent challenge show that HyGen outperforms a wide range of existing solely online and offline methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a receding-horizon, game-theoretic charging planning mechanism for electric ride-hailing markets. As the demand for ride-hailing services continues to surge and governments advocate for stricter environmental regulations, integrating electric vehicles into these markets becomes inevitable. The proposed framework addresses the challenges posed by dynamic demand patterns, fluctuating energy costs, and competitive dynamics inherent in such markets. Leveraging the concept of receding-horizon games, we propose a method to optimize proactive dispatching of vehicles for recharging over a predefined time horizon. We integrate a modified Tullock contest that accounts for customer abandonment due to long waiting times to model the expected market share, and by factoring in the demand-based electricity charging, we construct a game capturing interactions between two companies over the time horizon. For this game, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium and then present a semi-decentralized, iterative method to compute it. Finally, the method is evaluated in an open-loop and a closed-loop manner in a simulated numerical case study.

Abstract: Microservice is a way of splitting the logic of an application into small blocks that can be run on different computing units and used by other applications. It has been successful for cloud applications and is now increasingly used for edge applications. This new architecture brings many benefits but it makes deciding where a given service request should be executed (i.e. its placement) more complex as every small block needed for the request has to be placed.
  In this paper, we investigate decentralized request placement (DRP) for services using the microservice architecture. We consider the DRP problem as an instance of a traveling purchaser problem and propose an integer linear programming formulation. This formulation aims at minimizing energy consumption while respecting latency requirements. We consider two different energy consumption metrics, namely overall or marginal energy, to study how optimizing towards these impacts the request placement decision.
  Our simulations show that the request placement decision can indeed be influenced by the energy metric chosen, leading to different energy reduction strategies.

Abstract: As the modern electrical grid shifts towards distributed systems, there is an increasing need for rapid decision-making tools. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies are now pivotal in enhancing the efficiency of power dispatch operations, effectively overcoming the constraints of traditional optimization solvers with long computation times. However, this increased efficiency comes at a high environmental cost, escalating energy consumption and carbon emissions from computationally intensive AI/ML models. Despite their potential to transform power systems management, the environmental impact of these technologies often remains an overlooked aspect. This paper introduces the first comparison of energy demands across centralized, distributed, and decentralized ML-driven power dispatch models. We provide a detailed analysis of the energy and carbon footprint required for continuous operations on an IEEE 33 bus system, highlighting the critical trade-offs between operational efficiency and environmental sustainability. This study aims to guide future AI implementations in energy systems, ensuring they enhance not only efficiency but also prioritize ecological integrity.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of Patricia tries, the fundamental data structure underlying Ethereum's state management system. We develop a probabilistic model characterizing the distribution of path lengths in Patricia tries containing random Ethereum addresses and validate this model through extensive computational experiments. Our findings reveal the logarithmic scaling of average path lengths with respect to the number of addresses, confirming a crucial property for Ethereum's scalability. The study demonstrates high precision in predicting average path lengths, with discrepancies between theoretical and experimental results not exceeding 0.01 across tested scales from 100 to 100,000 addresses. We identify and verify the right-skewed nature of path length distributions, providing insights into worst-case scenarios and informing optimization strategies. Statistical analysis, including chi-square goodness-of-fit tests, strongly supports the model's accuracy. The research offers structural insights into node concentration at specific trie levels, suggesting avenues for optimizing storage and retrieval mechanisms. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of Ethereum's fundamental data structures and provide a solid foundation for future optimizations. The study concludes by outlining potential directions for future research, including investigations into extreme-scale behavior, dynamic trie performance, and the applicability of the model to non-uniform address distributions and other blockchain systems.

Abstract: The Metaverse, a burgeoning collective virtual space merging augmented reality and persistent virtual worlds, necessitates advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and communication technologies to support immersive and interactive experiences. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising technique for collaboratively training AI models while preserving data privacy. However, FL faces challenges such as high communication overhead and substantial computational demands, particularly for neural network (NN) models. To address these issues, we propose an integrated federated split learning and hyperdimensional computing (FSL-HDC) framework for emerging foundation models. This novel approach reduces communication costs, computation load, and privacy risks, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices in the Metaverse, ensuring real-time responsive interactions. Additionally, we introduce an optimization algorithm that concurrently optimizes transmission power and bandwidth to minimize the maximum transmission time among all users to the server. The simulation results based on the MNIST dataset indicate that FSL-HDC achieves an accuracy rate of approximately 87.5%, which is slightly lower than that of FL-HDC. However, FSL-HDC exhibits a significantly faster convergence speed, approximately 3.733x that of FSL-NN, and demonstrates robustness to non-IID data distributions. Moreover, our proposed optimization algorithm can reduce the maximum transmission time by up to 64% compared with the baseline.

Abstract: Decentralized stochastic control problems are intrinsically difficult to study because of the inapplicability of standard tools from centralized control such as dynamic programming and the resulting computational complexity. In this paper, we address some of these challenges for decentralized stochastic control with Borel spaces under three different but tightly related information structures under a unified theme: the one-step delayed information sharing pattern, the K-step periodic information sharing pattern, and the completely decentralized information structure where no sharing of information occurs. We will show that the one-step delayed and K-step periodic problems can be reduced to a centralized MDP, generalizing prior results which considered finite, linear, or static models, by addressing several measurability questions. The separated nature of policies under both information structures is then established. We then provide sufficient conditions for the transition kernels of both centralized reductions to be weak-Feller, which facilitates rigorous approximation and learning theoretic results. We will then show that for the completely decentralized control problem finite memory local policies are near optimal under a joint conditional mixing condition. This is achieved by obtaining a bound for finite memory policies which goes to zero as memory size increases. We will also provide a performance bound for the K-periodic problem, which results from replacing the full common information by a finite sliding window of information. The latter will depend on the condition of predictor stability in expected total variation, which we will establish. We finally show that under the periodic information sharing pattern, a quantized Q-learning algorithm converges asymptotically towards a near optimal solution. Each of the above, to our knowledge, is a new contribution to the literature.

<div> 关键词：d-SVD、d-PCA、ELAA系统、低秩矩阵完成、被动雷达检测

<br />
<br />总结:

本文研究了分布式奇异值分解(d-SVD)和分布式主成分分析(d-PCA)，这两个方法在各种信号处理应用中是基础。文章提出了两种场景下的d-SVD算法，分别适用于数据矩阵在每个本地节点以行方式可用的情况，以及数据矩阵通过两个不同测量系列生成外积隐式形成的情况。为了应对这些场景，文章利用轻量级局部有理函数近似方法和并行平均一致性算法，设计了两种d-SVD算法。此外，还提出了一种非平凡的裁剪技术，通过使用与主信号子空间正交的代表向量来进一步降低通信成本。通过在极大规模天线阵列(ELAA)系统的两个应用示例中应用这些算法——分散式传感器定位通过低秩矩阵完成和分散式被动雷达检测——证明了算法的有效性。仿真结果表明，与现有技术支持的分散式功率方法相比，提出的d-SVD算法能够收敛到中心解决方案，并具有较低的通信成本。 <div>

Abstract: In this article, the problems of decentralized Singular Value Decomposition (d-SVD) and decentralized Principal Component Analysis (d-PCA) are studied, which are fundamental in various signal processing applications. Two scenarios of d-SVD are considered depending on the availability of the data matrix under consideration. In the first scenario, the matrix of interest is row-wisely available in each local node in the network. In the second scenario, the matrix of interest implicitly forms an outer product generated from two different series of measurements. Combining the lightweight local rational function approximation approach and parallel averaging consensus algorithms, two d-SVD algorithms are proposed to cope with the two aforementioned scenarios. We demonstrate the proposed algorithms with two respective application examples for Extremely Large-scale Antenna Array (ELAA) systems: decentralized sensor localization via low-rank matrix completion and decentralized passive radar detection. Moreover, a non-trivial truncation technique, which employs a representative vector that is orthonormal to the principal signal subspace, is proposed to further reduce the associated communication cost with the d-SVD algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed d-SVD algorithms converge to the centralized solution with reduced communication cost compared to those facilitated with the state-of-the-art decentralized power method.

Abstract: Automated market makers (AMMs) are pricing mechanisms utilized by decentralized exchanges (DEX). Traditional AMM approaches are constrained by pricing solely based on their own liquidity pool, without consideration of external markets or risk management for liquidity providers. In this paper, we propose a new approach known as UBET AMM (UAMM), which calculates prices by considering external market prices and the impermanent loss of the liquidity pool. Despite relying on external market prices, our method maintains the desired properties of a constant product curve when computing slippages. The key element of UAMM is determining the appropriate slippage amount based on the desired target balance, which encourages the liquidity pool to minimize impermanent loss. We demonstrate that our approach eliminates arbitrage opportunities when external market prices are efficient.

总结:本文提出了一种针对Web 3.0的创新性框架，旨在优化区块链中的区块传播过程。首先，引入了基于年龄信息概念的新鲜度指标——Block Information Age（AoBI），用于量化区块的时效性。AoBI衡量从最新交易生成到完成区块共识的时间间隔。其次，通过将矿工分为五种不同状态，并借鉴流行病模型构建了一个区块传播模型，以提高传播效率。考虑到矿工的有限理性，作者提出了基于演化博弈的激励机制，进一步优化区块传播。实验结果表明，与现有机制相比，所提出的方案提高了区块转发概率，降低了平均AoBI的最小值，从而提升了整体的区块传播效率。 <div>

Abstract: Web 3.0 is regarded as a revolutionary paradigm that enables users to securely manage data without a centralized authority. Blockchains, which enable data to be managed in a decentralized and transparent manner, are key technologies for achieving Web 3.0 goals. However, Web 3.0 based on blockchains is still in its infancy, such as ensuring block freshness and optimizing block propagation for improving blockchain performance. In this paper, we develop a freshness-aware block propagation optimization framework for Web 3.0. We first propose a novel metric called Age of Block Information (AoBI) based on the concept of age of information to quantify block freshness. AoBI measures the time elapsed from the freshest transaction generation to the completion of block consensus. To make block propagation optimization tractable, we classify miners into five different states and propose a block propagation model for public blockchains inspired by epidemic models. Moreover, considering that the miners are bounded rational, we propose an incentive mechanism based on the evolutionary game for block propagation to improve block propagation efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate that compared with other block propagation mechanisms in public blockchains, the proposed scheme has a higher block forwarding probability, which improves block propagation efficiency and decreases the minimum value of average AoBI.

<div> 关键词：大规模MIMO系统、分散式基带处理、线性最小均方误差接收机、随机矩阵理论、信号干扰与噪声比

<br />
总结:

本文针对大规模多输入多输出（MIMO）系统的全潜力实现，讨论了集中式基带处理（CBP）面临的数据互联和高维计算两大挑战。为解决这些问题，提出了分散式基带处理（DBP），通过将基站的天线分割成多个集群，每个集群连接独立的射频电路并配备独立的计算单元。然而，现有文献中缺乏适用于一般集群间空间相关性和不完整信道状态信息（CSI）的最优融合方案及性能分析。

文章首先构建了一个所有集群都采用线性最小均方误差（LMMSE）接收器的分散式MIMO系统模型，且考虑了不完善的CSI情况。通过利用随机矩阵理论（RMT），建立了最优线性融合方案，并分析了其高计算和数据I/O成本。为了降低成本，进一步提出了两种具有较低复杂性的次优融合方案。对所有三种方案，均推导了信号干扰与噪声比（SINR）的封闭形式表达式，并阐述了在何种条件下次优方案能成为最优选择。此外，确定了分散式LMMSE接收器的最优正则化参数，识别了最佳天线分区策略，并证明了随着集群数量的增加，SINR会下降。数值模拟验证了理论结果的准确性。 <div>

Abstract: Centralized baseband processing (CBP) is required to achieve the full potential of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, due to the large number of antennas, CBP suffers from two major issues: 1) Tremendous data interconnection between radio frequency (RF) circuitry and processing fabrics; and 2) high-dimensional computation. To this end, decentralized baseband processing (DBP) has been proposed, where the antennas at the BS are partitioned into clusters connected to separate RF circuits and equipped with separate computing units. Unfortunately, due to the decentralized structure, the optimal fusion scheme and performance analysis for DBP with general spatial correlation between clusters and imperfect channel state information (CSI) are not available in the literature. In this paper, we consider a decentralized MIMO system where all clusters adopt linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) receivers with imperfect CSI. Specifically, we first establish the optimal linear fusion scheme which has high computational and data input/output (I/O) costs. To reduce the costs, we further propose two sub-optimal fusion schemes with reduced complexity. For all three schemes, we derive the closed-form expressions for the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) by leveraging random matrix theory (RMT) and demonstrate the conditions under which the sub-optimal schemes are optimal. Furthermore, we determine the optimal regularization parameter for decentralized LMMSE receivers, identify the best antenna partitioning strategy, and prove that the SINR will decrease as the number of clusters increases. Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the theoretical results.

<div> 关键词：分散式执行、贝尔曼原则、价值函数、规划复杂度、单代理方法

总结:

本文提出了一种新的分散式执行范式——顺序行动集中训练，以解决分散式部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程中的ε最优问题。该范式在保持贝尔曼原则的适用性的同时，引入了三个关键特性：

1. **集中规划者视角转变**：允许集中规划者基于顺序行动统计数据进行决策，而非先前的并行行动统计数据。这为集中规划者提供了一种更有效的信息基础。

2. **ε最优价值函数性质**：证明了在充分的顺序行动统计数据下，ε最优价值函数具有分段线性和凸性。这一性质简化了对价值函数的分析和优化过程。

3. **降低规划复杂度**：通过采用顺序行动策略，将备份操作者的复杂度从双指数级降低至多项式级，尽管这可能需要更长的规划时间。

4. **兼容单代理方法**：这一范式使得现有的单代理学习算法，如增强SARSA，能够直接应用于多代理系统中，同时仍能保证收敛性。

5. **实验验证**：通过在两种及多种代理的领域与ε最优并行行动解决方案进行比较，实验证明了新方法的优越性。

这种新型范式为多代理系统的高效规划和强化学习方法开辟了新的路径，显著提高了处理复杂多代理环境的能力。 <div>

Abstract: Centralized training for decentralized execution paradigm emerged as the state-of-the-art approach to epsilon-optimally solving decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes. However, scalability remains a significant issue. This paper presents a novel and more scalable alternative, namely sequential-move centralized training for decentralized execution. This paradigm further pushes the applicability of Bellman's principle of optimality, raising three new properties. First, it allows a central planner to reason upon sufficient sequential-move statistics instead of prior simultaneous-move ones. Next, it proves that epsilon-optimal value functions are piecewise linear and convex in sufficient sequential-move statistics. Finally, it drops the complexity of the backup operators from double exponential to polynomial at the expense of longer planning horizons. Besides, it makes it easy to use single-agent methods, e.g., SARSA algorithm enhanced with these findings applies while still preserving convergence guarantees. Experiments on two- as well as many-agent domains from the literature against epsilon-optimal simultaneous-move solvers confirm the superiority of the novel approach. This paradigm opens the door for efficient planning and reinforcement learning methods for multi-agent systems.

Abstract: In contrast to proof-of-work replication, Byzantine quorum systems maintain consistency across replicas with higher throughput modest energy consumption, and deterministic liveness guarantees. If complemented with heterogeneous trust and open membership, they have the potential to serve as blockchains backbone. This paper presents a general model of heterogeneous quorum systems where each participant can declare its own quorums, and captures the consistency, availability and inclusion properties of these systems. In order to support open membership, it then presents reconfiguration protocols for heterogeneous quorum systems including joining and leaving of a process, and adding and removing of a quorum, and further, proves their correctness in the face of Byzantine attacks. The design of the protocols is informed by the trade-offs that the paper proves for the properties that reconfigurations can preserve. The paper further presents a graph characterization of heterogeneous quorum systems, and its application for reconfiguration optimization.

Abstract: The blockchain system has emerged as one of the focal points of research in recent years, particularly in applications and services such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. In this context, the hash value serves as a crucial element in linking blocks within the blockchain, ensuring the integrity of block contents. Therefore, hash algorithms represent a vital security technology for ensuring the integrity and security of blockchain systems. This study primarily focuses on analyzing the security and execution efficiency of mainstream hash algorithms in the Proof of Work (PoW) calculations within blockchain systems. It proposes an evaluation factor and conducts comparative experiments to evaluate each hash algorithm. The experimental results indicate that there are no significant differences in the security aspects among SHA-2, SHA-3, and BLAKE2. However, SHA-2 and BLAKE2 demonstrate shorter computation times, indicating higher efficiency in execution.

Abstract: The proliferation of blockchain entities (persons or enterprises) exposes them to potential regulatory actions (e.g., being litigated) by regulatory authorities. Regulatory frameworks for crypto assets are actively being developed and refined, increasing the likelihood of such actions. The lack of systematic analysis of the factors driving litigation against blockchain entities leaves companies in need of clarity to navigate compliance risks. This absence of insight also deprives investors of the information for informed decision-making. This study focuses on U.S. litigation against blockchain entities, particularly by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) given its influence on global crypto regulation. Utilizing frontier pretrained language models and large language models, we systematically map all SEC complaints against blockchain companies from 2012 to 2024 to thematic factors conceptualized by our study to delineate the factors driving SEC actions. We quantify the thematic factors and assess their influence on specific legal Acts cited within the complaints on an annual basis, allowing us to discern the regulatory emphasis, patterns and conduct trend analysis.

Abstract: The pitfalls of centralized social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter/X, have led to concerns about control, transparency, and accountability. Decentralized social networks have emerged as a result with the goal of empowering users. These decentralized approaches come with their own tradeoffs, and therefore multiple architectures exist. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale analysis of Bluesky, a prominent decentralized microblogging platform. In contrast to alternative approaches (e.g. Mastodon), Bluesky decomposes and opens the key functions of the platform into subcomponents that can be provided by third party stakeholders. We collect a comprehensive dataset covering all the key elements of Bluesky, study user activity and assess the diversity of providers for each sub-components.

Toward efficient wireless LLM inference in edge computing, this study comprehensively analyzes the impact of different splitting points in mainstream open-source LLMs. On this basis, this study introduces a framework taking inspiration from model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) to determine the optimal splitting point across the edge and user equipment (UE). By incorporating a reward surrogate model, our approach significantly reduces the computational cost of frequent performance evaluations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this method effectively balances inference performance and computational load under varying network conditions, providing a robust solution for LLM deployment in decentralized settings.

<div> 关键词：经济模型、执行票、MEV捕获、风险厌恶、中央化

<br /><br />
总结:

本文构建了一个经济模型来研究执行票（Execution Tickets）如何帮助以太坊协议从区块构建中捕获最大提取价值（MEV）。研究发现：

1. 当所有购买者在同质、无风险偏好和无资本成本的情况下，执行票能够完全捕获MEV。

2. 随着风险厌恶程度和资本成本的增加，MEV捕获能力会下降。

3. 在购买者存在异质性时，MEV捕获可能会非常低，单一主导购买者可以大量捕获MEV。然而，通过提案构建分离（Proposer-Builder Separation, PBS）机制，执行票购买者可以访问专业构建者的市场，这在一定程度上缓解了集中化问题。

4. 实际中，尽管引入了PBS机制，但仍然存在集中化趋势。在PBS机制下，执行票主要集中在那些具有最高前向MEV提取能力和最低资本成本的参与者手中。

5. 文章指出，即使非构建者的大投资者，如果在资本成本上有显著优势，也可能主导执行票市场。这揭示了以太坊生态系统中可能存在的集中化风险及其复杂性。 <div>

Abstract: We provide an economic model of Execution Tickets and use it to study the ability of the Ethereum protocol to capture MEV from block construction. We demonstrate that Execution Tickets extract all MEV when all buyers are homogeneous, risk neutral and face no capital costs. We also show that MEV capture decreases with risk aversion and capital costs. Moreover, when buyers are heterogeneous, MEV capture can be especially low and a single dominant buyer can extract much of the MEV. This adverse effect can be partially mitigated by the presence of a Proposer Builder Separation (PBS) mechanism, which gives ET buyers access to a market of specialized builders, but in practice centralization vectors still persist. With PBS, ETs are concentrated among those with the highest ex-ante MEV extraction ability and lowest cost of capital. We show how it is possible that large investors that are not builders but have substantial advantage in capital cost can come to dominate the ET market.

Abstract: Privacy-preservation policies are guidelines formulated to protect data providers private data. Previous privacy-preservation methodologies have addressed privacy in which data are permanently stored in repositories and disconnected from changing data provider privacy preferences. This occurrence becomes evident as data moves to another data repository. Hence, the need for data providers to control and flexibly update their existing privacy preferences due to changing data usage continues to remain a problem. This paper proposes a blockchain-based methodology for preserving data providers private and sensitive data. The research proposes to tightly couple data providers private attribute data element to privacy preferences and data accessor data element into a privacy tuple. The implementation presents a framework of tightly-coupled relational database and blockchains. This delivers secure, tamper-resistant, and query-efficient platform for data management and query processing. The evaluation analysis from the implementation validates efficient query processing of privacy-aware queries on the privacy infrastructure.

Abstract: The superiority of Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) in various complex environments is unquestionable. However, in complex situations such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and automated production, robots are often required to work collaboratively without a central control unit. This necessitates an efficient and robust decentralized control mechanism to process local information and guide the robots' behavior. In this work, we propose a new decentralized controller design method that utilizes the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm from deep reinforcement learning, aimed at improving the integration of local information and robustness of multi-robot systems. The designed controller allows each robot to make decisions independently based on its local observations while enhancing the overall system's collaborative efficiency and adaptability to dynamic environments through a shared learning mechanism. Through testing in simulated environments, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of this controller in improving task execution efficiency, strengthening system fault tolerance, and enhancing adaptability to the environment. Furthermore, we explored the impact of DQN parameter tuning on system performance, providing insights for further optimization of the controller design. Our research not only showcases the potential application of the DQN algorithm in the decentralized control of multi-robot systems but also offers a new perspective on how to enhance the overall performance and robustness of the system through the integration of local information.

Abstract: The circular economy has the potential to increase resource efficiency and minimize waste through the 4R framework of reducing, reusing, recycling, and recovering. Blockchain technology is currently considered a valuable aid in the transition to a circular economy. Its decentralized and tamper-resistant nature enables the construction of transparent and secure supply chain management systems, thereby improving product accountability and traceability. However, the full potential of blockchain technology in circular economy models will not be realized until a number of concerns, including scalability, interoperability, data protection, and regulatory and legal issues, are addressed. More research and stakeholder participation are required to overcome these limitations and achieve the benefits of blockchain technology in promoting a circular economy. This article presents a systematic literature review (SLR) that identified industry use cases for blockchain-driven circular economy models and offered architectures to minimize resource consumption, prices, and inefficiencies while encouraging the reuse, recycling, and recovery of end-of-life products. Three main outcomes emerged from our review of 41 documents, which included scholarly publications, Twitter-linked information, and Google results. The relationship between blockchain and the 4R framework for circular economy; discussion the terminology and various forms of blockchain and circular economy; and identification of the challenges and obstacles that blockchain technology may face in enabling a circular economy. This research shows how blockchain technology can help with the transition to a circular economy. Yet, it emphasizes the importance of additional study and stakeholder participation to overcome potential hurdles and obstacles in implementing blockchain-driven circular economy models.

总结:

文章主要探讨了医药非依从性的问题以及智能药盒在解决这一问题中的应用。非依从性指的是患者未能遵循医生开具的药物使用指导，这不仅降低了治疗效果，还可能增加死亡和住院风险。当前市场上已有诸如智能给药系统(IDAS)和智能药片等工具来帮助患者管理用药时间，但这些工具在商业推广中面临挑战。

为了解决这些问题，作者提出了一种基于物联网（IoT）原理的智能健康依从性工具——智能药盒。该药盒利用RFID进行数据记录和NFC进行数据提取，配备负载传感器以精确测量剂量，并配备Android应用程序监控用药情况、提供建议并发出警告。为了进一步提高工具的有效性和个性化，文章提出了将联邦学习整合到系统中。联邦学习允许智能药盒从多个用户的数据中学习，而不侵犯个人隐私。通过在不同智能药盒收集的分散数据上训练机器学习模型，系统可以不断改进其推荐和警报，适应用户的多样化需求和行为模式。这种方法不仅增强了工具支持用药依从性的能力，同时也确保了敏感用户数据的安全性和隐私性。 <div>

Abstract: Medication nonadherence significantly reduces the effectiveness of therapies, yet it remains prevalent among patients. Nonadherence has been linked to adverse outcomes, including increased risks of mortality and hospitalization. Although various methods exist to help patients track medication schedules, such as the Intelligent Drug Administration System (IDAS) and Smart Blister, these tools often face challenges that hinder their commercial viability. Building on the principles of dosage measurement and information communication in IoT, we introduce the Smart Pill Case a smart health adherence tool that leverages RFID-based data recording and NFC-based data extraction. This system incorporates a load cell for precise dosage measurement and features an Android app to monitor medication intake, offer suggestions, and issue warnings. To enhance the effectiveness and personalization of the Smart Pill Case, we propose integrating federated learning into the system. Federated learning allows the Smart Pill Case to learn from medication adherence patterns across multiple users without compromising individual privacy. By training machine learning models on decentralized data collected from various Smart Pill Cases, the system can continuously improve its recommendations and warnings, adapting to the diverse needs and behaviors of users. This approach not only enhances the tools ability to support medication adherence but also ensures that sensitive user data remains secure and private.

Abstract: With the development of blockchain technology, smart contracts have become an important component of blockchain applications. Despite their crucial role, the development of smart contracts may introduce vulnerabilities and potentially lead to severe consequences, such as financial losses. Meanwhile, large language models, represented by ChatGPT, have gained great attentions, showcasing great capabilities in code analysis tasks. In this paper, we presented an empirical study to investigate the performance of ChatGPT in identifying smart contract vulnerabilities. Initially, we evaluated ChatGPT's effectiveness using a publicly available smart contract dataset. Our findings discover that while ChatGPT achieves a high recall rate, its precision in pinpointing smart contract vulnerabilities is limited. Furthermore, ChatGPT's performance varies when detecting different vulnerability types. We delved into the root causes for the false positives generated by ChatGPT, and categorized them into four groups. Second, by comparing ChatGPT with other state-of-the-art smart contract vulnerability detection tools, we found that ChatGPT's F-score is lower than others for 3 out of the 7 vulnerabilities. In the case of the remaining 4 vulnerabilities, ChatGPT exhibits a slight advantage over these tools. Finally, we analyzed the limitation of ChatGPT in smart contract vulnerability detection, revealing that the robustness of ChatGPT in this field needs to be improved from two aspects: its uncertainty in answering questions; and the limited length of the detected code. In general, our research provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of employing large language models, specifically ChatGPT, for the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities.

总结:
本文提出了一种名为“双层协调学习”（Bi-CL）的新方法，旨在解决多机器人系统中协调任务的挑战。该方法通过在集中式训练和分布式执行框架下构建双层优化结构来实现这一目标。双层优化将原始问题分解为具有减小动作空间的强化学习层和从全局优化器获得示范的模仿学习层，从而提高了学习效率和可扩展性。然而，由于机器人信息不完整，导致了两个学习模型之间的不匹配。为了解决这个问题，Bi-CL引入了一个对齐惩罚机制，旨在最小化两层学习模型之间的差异，同时保持其训练效率。通过一个运行示例的概念化问题描述以及在基于路线和图的场景中的应用，文章展示了Bi-CL能够更高效地学习，并与传统的多代理强化学习基线在多机器人协调任务上达到相当的表现。 <div>

Abstract: In multi-robot systems, achieving coordinated missions remains a significant challenge due to the coupled nature of coordination behaviors and the lack of global information for individual robots. To mitigate these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach, Bi-level Coordination Learning (Bi-CL), that leverages a bi-level optimization structure within a centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. Our bi-level reformulation decomposes the original problem into a reinforcement learning level with reduced action space, and an imitation learning level that gains demonstrations from a global optimizer. Both levels contribute to improved learning efficiency and scalability. We note that robots' incomplete information leads to mismatches between the two levels of learning models. To address this, Bi-CL further integrates an alignment penalty mechanism, aiming to minimize the discrepancy between the two levels without degrading their training efficiency. We introduce a running example to conceptualize the problem formulation and apply Bi-CL to two variations of this example: route-based and graph-based scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that Bi-CL can learn more efficiently and achieve comparable performance with traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines for multi-robot coordination.

Abstract: The adoption of microservice architecture has seen a considerable upswing in recent years, mainly driven by the need to modernize legacy systems and address their limitations. Legacy systems, typically designed as monolithic applications, often struggle with maintenance, scalability, and deployment inefficiencies. This study investigates the motivations, activities, and challenges associated with migrating from monolithic legacy systems to microservices, aiming to shed light on common practices and challenges from a practitioner's point of view. We conducted a comprehensive study with 53 software practitioners who use microservices, expanding upon previous research by incorporating diverse international perspectives. Our mixed-methods approach includes quantitative and qualitative analyses, focusing on four main aspects: (i) the driving forces behind migration, (ii) the activities to conduct the migration, (iii) strategies for managing data consistency, and (iv) the prevalent challenges. Thus, our results reveal diverse practices and challenges practitioners face when migrating to microservices. Companies are interested in technical benefits, enhancing maintenance, scalability, and deployment processes. Testing in microservice environments remains complex, and extensive monitoring is crucial to managing the dynamic nature of microservices. Database management remains challenging. While most participants prefer decentralized databases for autonomy and scalability, challenges persist in ensuring data consistency. Additionally, many companies leverage modern cloud technologies to mitigate network overhead, showcasing the importance of cloud infrastructure in facilitating efficient microservice communication.

Abstract: A novel approach for achieving fast evasion in self-localized swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) threatened by an intruding moving object is presented in this paper. Motivated by natural self-organizing systems, the presented approach of fast and collective evasion enables the UAV swarm to avoid dynamic objects (interferers) that are actively approaching the group. The main objective of the proposed technique is the fast and safe escape of the swarm from an interferer ~discovered in proximity. This method is inspired by the collective behavior of groups of certain animals, such as schools of fish or flocks of birds. These animals use the limited information of their sensing organs and decentralized control to achieve reliable and effective group motion. The system presented in this paper is intended to execute the safe coordination of UAV swarms with a large number of agents. Similar to natural swarms, this system propagates a fast shock of information about detected interferers throughout the group to achieve dynamic and collective evasion. The proposed system is fully decentralized using only onboard sensors to mutually localize swarm agents and interferers, similar to how animals accomplish this behavior. As a result, the communication structure between swarm agents is not overwhelmed by information about the state (position and velocity) of each individual and it is reliable to communication dropouts. The proposed system and theory were numerically evaluated and verified in real-world experiments.

<div> 关键词：电力系统、边际排放率、分布式算法、稀疏矩阵、并行计算

总结:

本文研究了电力系统中计算边际排放率（LME）的方法，边际排放率衡量了碳排放对电力需求的敏感性，对于评估减排措施的影响至关重要。文章指出，与位置边际价格（LMPs）类似，LME在地理上可能有很大差异，甚至在同一区域内也会随时间变化，这主要是由于储能和调节限制等因素导致的时间耦合现象。这种时间耦合使得在大型电力网络中计算LME变得非常耗时。

为了解决这个问题，文章提出了一种基于分布式算法的并行计算方法，通过分解不同时间步骤来减少计算复杂度。然而，作者发现这种方法在实际应用中并未能有效提高效率，原因在于电力系统问题通常具有稀疏结构，这限制了分布式算法的性能提升潜力。

针对这一挑战，作者进一步引入了一种全新的并行、反向模式的分布式求导方案，该方案无需显式构建解决方案映射雅可比矩阵，从而实现了在计算电网排放敏感性时的高效并行化处理。理论分析和实验结果均表明，与集中式和传统分布式方法相比，这种方法可以实现超过10倍的加速效果。

总的来说，本文提出了一个创新的计算框架，旨在克服分布式算法在电力系统中计算边际排放率时面临的局限性，通过并行计算显著提高了计算效率，为电力系统的减排策略评估提供了更快速、准确的支持工具。 <div>

Abstract: Marginal emissions rates -- the sensitivity of carbon emissions to electricity demand -- are important for evaluating the impact of emissions mitigation measures. Like locational marginal prices, locational marginal emissions rates (LMEs) can vary geographically, even between nearby locations, and may be coupled across time periods because of, for example, storage and ramping constraints. This temporal coupling makes computing LMEs computationally expensive for large electricity networks with high storage and renewable penetrations. Recent work demonstrates that decentralized algorithms can mitigate this problem by decoupling timesteps during differentiation. Unfortunately, we show these potential speedups are negated by the sparse structure inherent in power systems problems. We address these limitations by introducing a parallel, reverse-mode decentralized differentiation scheme that never explicitly instantiates the solution map Jacobian. We show both theoretically and empirically that parallelization is necessary to achieve non-trivial speedups when computing grid emissions sensitivities. Numerical results on a 500 node system indicate that our method can achieve greater than 10x speedups over centralized and serial decentralized approaches.

Abstract: Crowd-sensing has emerged as a powerful data retrieval model, enabling diverse applications by leveraging active user participation. However, data availability and privacy concerns pose significant challenges. Traditional methods like data encryption and anonymization, while essential, may not fully address these issues. For instance, in sparsely populated areas, anonymized data can still be traced back to individual users. Additionally, the volume of data generated by users can reveal their identities. To develop credible crowd-sensing systems, data must be anonymized, aggregated and separated into uniformly sized chunks. Furthermore, decentralizing the data management process, rather than relying on a single server, can enhance security and trust. This paper proposes a system utilizing smart contracts and blockchain technologies to manage crowd-sensing campaigns. The smart contract handles user subscriptions, data encryption, and decentralized storage, creating a secure data marketplace. Incentive policies within the smart contract encourage user participation and data diversity. Simulation results confirm the system's viability, highlighting the importance of user participation for data credibility and the impact of geographical data scarcity on rewards. This approach aims to balance data origin and reduce cheating risks.

Abstract: The escalating prevalence of encryption protocols has led to a concomitant surge in the number of malicious attacks that hide in encrypted traffic. Power grid systems, as fundamental infrastructure, are becoming prime targets for such attacks. Conventional methods for detecting malicious encrypted packets typically use a static pre-trained model. We observe that these methods are not well-suited for blockchain-based power grid systems. More critically, they fall short in dynamic environments where new types of encrypted attacks continuously emerge. Motivated by this, in this paper we try to tackle these challenges from two aspects: (1) We present a novel framework that is able to automatically detect malicious encrypted traffic in blockchain-based power grid systems and incrementally learn from new malicious traffic. (2) We mathematically derive incremental learning losses to resist the forgetting of old attack patterns while ensuring the model is capable of handling new encrypted attack patterns. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three different benchmark datasets. We also constructed the first malicious encrypted traffic dataset for blockchain-based power grid scenario. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/PPPmzt/ETGuard, hoping to inspire future research.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a pivotal approach in decentralized machine learning, especially when data privacy is crucial and direct data sharing is impractical. While FL is typically associated with supervised learning, its potential in unsupervised scenarios is underexplored. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised federated learning methodology designed to identify the complete set of categories (global K) across multiple clients within label-free, non-uniform data distributions, a process known as Federated Clustering. Our approach, Federated Cluster-Wise Refinement (FedCRef), involves clients that collaboratively train models on clusters with similar data distributions. Initially, clients with diverse local data distributions (local K) train models on their clusters to generate compressed data representations. These local models are then shared across the network, enabling clients to compare them through reconstruction error analysis, leading to the formation of federated groups.In these groups, clients collaboratively train a shared model representing each data distribution, while continuously refining their local clusters to enhance data association accuracy. This iterative process allows our system to identify all potential data distributions across the network and develop robust representation models for each. To validate our approach, we compare it with traditional centralized methods, establishing a performance baseline and showcasing the advantages of our distributed solution. We also conduct experiments on the EMNIST and KMNIST datasets, demonstrating FedCRef's ability to refine and align cluster models with actual data distributions, significantly improving data representation precision in unsupervised federated settings.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into the electricity grid, which is essential for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The rapid increase in EV adoption poses significant challenges to the existing grid infrastructure, particularly in managing the increasing electricity demand and mitigating the risk of grid overloads. Centralized EV charging strategies are investigated due to their potential to optimize grid stability and efficiency, compared to decentralized approaches that may exacerbate grid stress. Utilizing a multi-agent based simulation model, the study provides a realistic representation of the electric vehicle home charging ecosystem in a case study of Strib, Denmark. The findings show that the Earliest-deadline-first and Round Robin perform best with 100% EV adoption in terms of EV user satisfaction. The simulation considers a realistic adoption curve, EV charging strategies, EV models, and driving patterns to capture the full ecosystem dynamics over a long-term period with high resolution (hourly). Additionally, the study offers detailed load profiles for future distribution grids, demonstrating how centralized charging strategies can efficiently manage grid loads and prevent overloads.

Abstract: The growing shift towards a Smart Grid involves integrating numerous new digital energy solutions into the energy ecosystems to address problems arising from the transition to carbon neutrality, particularly in linking the electricity and transportation sectors. Yet, this shift brings challenges due to mass electric vehicle adoption and the lack of methods to adequately assess various EV charging algorithms and their ecosystem impacts. This paper introduces a multi-agent based simulation model, validated through a case study of a Danish radial distribution network serving 126 households. The study reveals that traditional charging leads to grid overload by 2031 at 67% EV penetration, while decentralized strategies like Real-Time Pricing could cause overloads as early as 2028. The developed multi-agent based simulation demonstrates its ability to offer detailed, hourly analysis of future load profiles in distribution grids, and therefore, can be applied to other prospective scenarios in similar energy systems.

<div> 关键词：分布式计算、虚拟图着色、嵌入性、复杂度、去中心化操作

总结:
本文探讨了分布式计算中的虚拟图着色问题。虚拟图着色是在通信图中局部嵌套目标图进行的，这既扩展了经典分布式图着色的概念（即目标图与通信图相等），也涵盖了群集图和功率图等先前研究的场景。

文章的主要发现是，虚拟图的着色复杂度依赖于其嵌入的边缘拥塞。特别引人注目的是，对于具有常数拥塞的虚拟图，其着色速度几乎可以与普通图一样快。为此，作者提出了一种在O(log^4 log n)轮次内的算法解决deg+1着色问题，其中节点被分配的颜色数量多于其度数。

这一结果表明，即使在节点操作去中心化的条件下，某些分布式图问题也能得到解决。这不仅丰富了分布式计算领域的理论知识，也为实际网络设计和优化提供了新的视角。 <div>

Abstract: Graph coloring is fundamental to distributed computing. We give the first general treatment of the coloring of virtual graphs, where the graph $H$ to be colored is locally embedded within the communication graph $G$. Besides generalizing classical distributed graph coloring (where $H=G$), this captures other previously studied settings, including cluster graphs and power graphs.
  We find that the complexity of coloring a virtual graph depends on the edge congestion of its embedding. The main question of interest is how fast we can color virtual graphs of constant congestion. We find that, surprisingly, these graphs can be colored nearly as fast as ordinary graphs. Namely, we give a $O(\log^4\log n)$-round algorithm for the deg+1-coloring problem, where each node is assigned more colors than its degree.
  This can be viewed as a case where a distributed graph problem can be solved even when the operation of each node is decentralized.

总结:
文章探讨了在联邦学习(Federated Learning, FL)框架下，如何利用防御策略来对抗基于生成对抗网络(Generative Adversarial Network, GAN)的攻击。联邦学习旨在整合分散的数据孤岛同时保持数据隐私。然而，近期研究揭示了GAN攻击能够学习私人数据集的分布并重构可识别的图像。针对这一问题，本文提出了名为Anti-GAN的框架，旨在防止攻击者学习到受害者数据的真实分布。

Anti-GAN的核心理念是通过操纵私有训练图像的视觉特征，使得即使是攻击者也无法仅凭肉眼识别这些特征。具体实现上，Anti-GAN将私有数据集投影至GAN的生成器中，并将生成的假图像与实际图像结合，形成用于联邦模型训练的训练集。实验结果表明，Anti-GAN在有效防止攻击者学习到私有图像分布的同时，对联邦模型的准确性影响较小。这为在保护数据隐私的前提下进行模型训练提供了一种有效的方法。 <div>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized model training framework that aims to merge isolated data islands while maintaining data privacy. However, recent studies have revealed that Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based attacks can be employed in FL to learn the distribution of private datasets and reconstruct recognizable images. In this paper, we exploit defenses against GAN-based attacks in FL and propose a framework, Anti-GAN, to prevent attackers from learning the real distribution of the victim's data. The core idea of Anti-GAN is to manipulate the visual features of private training images to make them indistinguishable to human eyes even restored by attackers. Specifically, Anti-GAN projects the private dataset onto a GAN's generator and combines the generated fake images with the actual images to create the training dataset, which is then used for federated model training. The experimental results demonstrate that Anti-GAN is effective in preventing attackers from learning the distribution of private images while causing minimal harm to the accuracy of the federated model.

Abstract: Despite advances in artificial intelligence-enhanced trading methods, developing a profitable automated trading system remains challenging in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. This research focuses on developing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to tackle the complexities of trading five prominent altcoins: Binance Coin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Tether. To this end, we present the CausalReinforceNet~(CRN) framework, which integrates both Bayesian and dynamic Bayesian network techniques to empower the RL agent in trade decision-making. We develop two agents using the framework based on distinct RL algorithms to analyse performance compared to the Buy-and-Hold benchmark strategy and a baseline RL model. The results indicate that our framework surpasses both models in profitability, highlighting CRN's consistent superiority, although the level of effectiveness varies across different cryptocurrencies.

<div> 关键词：比特币、多链世界、安全、活络性、组合操作

总结:

本文研究了在多条区块链并存的环境中，如何构建具有更高安全性和活络性的叠加区块链。通过类比电子电路中的串行和并行连接，作者提出了两种基本的组合操作——串行和三角形组合，并使用这些操作作为构建块来构造通用的叠加区块链。

在部分同步环境下，本文给出了以下结果：
1. 串行组合两个区块链产生的叠加区块链在至少一个基础区块链安全的情况下保持安全性，在两个基础区块链都活络的情况下保持活络性。
2. 三角形组合三个区块链类似于电路中并行组合，产生的叠加区块链在所有基础区块链都安全的情况下保持安全性，在超过一半的基础区块链活络的情况下保持活络性。
3. 这些基本操作的重复组合可以产生任意数量基础区块链上构建的叠加区块链可能的安全性和活络性权衡。

此外，这些结果也扩展到了完全同步的环境。通过这种方式，文章提供了一种方法，允许在多链系统中创建具有特定安全性和活络性特性的叠加区块链，以适应不同的需求和场景。 <div>

Abstract: Since the creation of Bitcoin 15 years ago, there has been an explosion in the number of permissionless blockchains. Each of these blockchains provides an open ledger that anyone can read from and write to. In this multi-chain world, an important question emerges: how can we build a more secure overlay blockchain by reading from and writing to a given set of blockchains? Drawing an analogy with switching circuits, we approach the problem by defining two basic compositional operations between blockchains, serial and triangular compositions, and use these operations as building blocks to construct general overlay blockchains. Under the partially synchronous setting, we have the following results: 1) the serial composition, between two blockchains, yields an overlay blockchain that is safe if at least one of the two underlay blockchains is safe and that is live if both of them are live; 2) the triangular composition between three blockchains, akin to parallel composition of switching circuits, yields an overlay blockchain that is safe if all underlay blockchains are safe and that is live if over half of them are live; 3) repeated composition of these two basic operations can yield all possible tradeoffs of safety and liveness for an overlay blockchain built on arbitrary number of underlay chains. The results are also extended to the synchronous setting.

<div> 关键词：智能合约、区块链性能、并行执行、冲突图、状态机复制

总结:

本文研究了在区块链领域中，如何在保证数据一致性和系统安全的前提下，最大化利用多核计算资源来提升智能合约执行效率的问题。文章首先指出，当前区块链系统的性能瓶颈主要在于智能合约的执行过程，这涉及到大量的计算和存储需求。随着现代计算机硬件向多核心发展，提高程序执行的并行度成为提升性能的有效途径。

为了深入理解这一问题，作者引入了“冲突图”这一概念，用来表示同一区块中交易之间的依赖关系。文章发现，现有的区块链并发解决方案依赖于全序阶段来确保所有副本之间的一致性，但这种做法可能被区块创建者利用来降低整体性能。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了一种新的框架——Active State Machine Replication（ASMR），旨在实现严格可串行化的同时，允许一定程度的并行执行。

文章还定义了“图形调度”和“最小延迟调度问题”，并证明了该问题的NP难度。进一步地，作者将这个问题与经典的图顶点着色问题进行了对比，揭示了同质交易与异构交易场景下的复杂性差异。最后，文章讨论了这些理论成果对实际应用的影响，包括可能的技术挑战和改进方向。

通过以上分析，文章为区块链领域的并发执行优化提供了一个全新的视角，为后续研究和实践提供了理论基础和参考。 <div>

Abstract: Executing smart contracts is a compute and storage-intensive task, which currently dominates modern blockchain's performance. Given that computers are becoming increasingly multicore, concurrency is an attractive approach to improve programs' execution runtime. A unique challenge of blockchains is that all replicas (miners or validators) must execute all smart contracts in the same logical order to maintain the semantics of State Machine Replication (SMR).
  In this work, we study the maximal level of parallelism attainable when focusing on the conflict graph between transactions packaged in the same block. This exposes a performance vulnerability that block creators may exploit against existing blockchain concurrency solutions, which rely on a total ordering phase for maintaining consistency amongst all replicas. To facilitate the formal aspects of our study, we develop a novel generic framework for Active State Machine Replication (ASMR) that is strictly serializable. We introduce the concept of graph scheduling and the definition of the minimal latency scheduling problem, which we prove to be NP-hard. We show that the restricted version of this problem for homogeneous transactions is equivalent to the classic Graph Vertex Coloring Problem, yet show that the heterogeneous case is more complex. We discuss the practical implications of these results.

<div> 关键词：Byzantine协议、同步性、最优复杂度、HashExt、ErrorFreeExt

总结:

本文探讨了在同步环境中，即使存在最多t个任意故障，n个进程如何达成一致的L位值问题，即Byzantine协议。文章指出，长期以来，研究者一直在努力优化这一协议在同步环境下的位复杂度，最终成果是COOL，这是一种在计算能力无限的对手面前具有确定安全性的无错误解决方案，其最坏情况下的位复杂度为O(nL + n^2 logn)，这是根据Dolev-Reischuk下界对于L >= n logn来说的最优结果。然而，COOL满足的强一致性条件并不适用于现代状态机复制（SMR）和区块链协议，这些系统更看重进度，要求决定的值始终有效，而不仅仅是当有共识时才有效。

为了满足这些系统的需求，文章提出了两个新的同步算法：HashExt和ErrorFreeExt。HashExt仅使用哈希函数，复杂度为O(nL + n^3 kappa)，其中kappa为哈希大小，对于L >= n^2 kappa来说是最佳选择。ErrorFreeExt则完全不使用任何加密技术，实现无错误的解决方案，其复杂度接近O((nL + n^2) logn)，对于任何L来说都是接近最优的。这两个算法都具有最佳鲁棒性（容忍最多t < n/3的故障），并能在实际故障数f + 1轮内停止运行。 <div>

Abstract: Byzantine agreement enables n processes to agree on a common L-bit value, despite up to t > 0 arbitrary failures. A long line of work has been dedicated to improving the bit complexity of Byzantine agreement in synchrony. This has culminated in COOL, an error-free (deterministically secure against a computationally unbounded adversary) solution that achieves O(nL + n^2 logn) worst-case bit complexity (which is optimal for L >= n logn according to the Dolev-Reischuk lower bound). COOL satisfies strong unanimity: if all correct processes propose the same value, only that value can be decided. Strong unanimity is, however, not sufficient for today's state machine replication (SMR) and blockchain protocols. These systems value progress and require a decided value to always be valid, excluding default decisions (such as EMPTY) even in cases where there is no unanimity a priori. Validated Byzantine agreement satisfies this property (called external validity). Yet, the best error-free (or even signature-free) validated agreement solutions achieve only O(n^2L) bit complexity, a far cry from the Omega(nL + n^2) Dolev-Reishcuk lower bound. In this paper, we present two new synchronous algorithms for validated Byzantine agreement, HashExt and ErrorFreeExt, with different trade-offs. Both algorithms are (1) signature-free, (2) optimally resilient (tolerate up to t < n / 3 failures), and (3) early-stopping (terminate in O(f+1) rounds, where f <= t is the actual number of failures). On the one hand, HashExt uses only hashes and achieves O(nL + n^3 kappa) bit complexity, which is optimal for L >= n^2 kappa (where kappa is the size of a hash). On the other hand, ErrorFreeExt is error-free, using no cryptography whatsoever, and achieves O( (nL + n^2) logn ) bit complexity, which is near-optimal for any L.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has exploded in popularity in recent years. Many approaches have been developed but they can be divided into three main types: centralized training and execution (CTE), centralized training for decentralized execution (CTDE), and Decentralized training and execution (DTE). Decentralized training and execution methods make the fewest assumptions and are often simple to implement. In fact, as I'll discuss, any single-agent RL method can be used for DTE by just letting each agent learn separately. Of course, there are pros and cons to such approaches. It is worth noting that DTE is required if no offline coordination is available. That is, if all agents must learn during online interactions without prior coordination, learning and execution must both be decentralized. DTE methods can be applied in cooperative, competitive, or mixed cases but this text will focus on the cooperative MARL case.
  This text is an introduction to the field of decentralized, cooperative MARL. As such, I will first give a brief description of the cooperative MARL problem in the form of the Dec-POMDP. Then, I will discuss value-based DTE methods starting with independent Q-learning and its extensions and then discuss the extension to the deep case with DQN, the additional complications this causes, and methods that have been developed to (attempt to) address these issues. Next, I will discuss policy gradient DTE methods starting with independent REINFORCE (i.e., vanilla policy gradient), and then extending to the actor-critic case and deep variants (such as independent PPO). Finally, I will discuss some general topics related to DTE and future directions.

Abstract: This work focuses on the decentralized deep learning optimization framework. We propose Adjacent Leader Decentralized Gradient Descent (AL-DSGD), for improving final model performance, accelerating convergence, and reducing the communication overhead of decentralized deep learning optimizers. AL-DSGD relies on two main ideas. Firstly, to increase the influence of the strongest learners on the learning system it assigns weights to different neighbor workers according to both their performance and the degree when averaging among them, and it applies a corrective force on the workers dictated by both the currently best-performing neighbor and the neighbor with the maximal degree. Secondly, to alleviate the problem of the deterioration of the convergence speed and performance of the nodes with lower degrees, AL-DSGD relies on dynamic communication graphs, which effectively allows the workers to communicate with more nodes while keeping the degrees of the nodes low. Experiments demonstrate that AL-DSGD accelerates the convergence of the decentralized state-of-the-art techniques and improves their test performance especially in the communication constrained environments. We also theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed scheme. Finally, we release to the community a highly general and concise PyTorch-based library for distributed training of deep learning models that supports easy implementation of any distributed deep learning approach ((a)synchronous, (de)centralized).

总结:

本文研究了在分布式多代理系统中进行协作推理和决策的框架——分布式优化。主要关注的是如何通过迭代结合本地计算和消息交换来最小化共享目标函数的问题。其中，D-ADMM算法是一个常用的解决方法，但其面临的主要挑战是需要大量的通信来达成共识，这在实际应用中可能会消耗大量的功率、延迟和信道资源。

为了解决这个问题，作者提出了“展开D-ADMM”（Unfolded D-ADMM），这是一种利用深度学习技术来优化D-ADMM算法的方法。通过数据驱动调整算法的超参数，使得每个代理只需要预定义数量的消息即可可靠地运行D-ADMM。这种展开方式不仅保持了原始D-ADMM的可解释性和灵活性，还显著减少了通信量，而不会影响性能。

具体而言，展开D-ADMM适用于两种典型场景：分布式估计任务，如稀疏恢复；以及分布式学习情景，多个代理合作学习机器学习模型。数值结果表明，该方法能够大幅度降低D-ADMM的通信需求，同时保持其性能。 <div>

Abstract: Distributed optimization is a fundamental framework for collaborative inference and decision making in decentralized multi-agent systems. The operation is modeled as the joint minimization of a shared objective which typically depends on observations gathered locally by each agent. Distributed optimization algorithms, such as the common D-ADMM, tackle this task by iteratively combining local computations and message exchanges. One of the main challenges associated with distributed optimization, and particularly with D-ADMM, is that it requires a large number of communications, i.e., messages exchanged between the agents, to reach consensus. This can make D-ADMM costly in power, latency, and channel resources. In this work we propose unfolded D-ADMM, which follows the emerging deep unfolding methodology to enable D-ADMM to operate reliably with a predefined and small number of messages exchanged by each agent. Unfolded D-ADMM fully preserves the operation of D-ADMM, while leveraging data to tune the hyperparameters of each iteration of the algorithm. These hyperparameters can either be agent-specific, aiming at achieving the best performance within a fixed number of iterations over a given network, or shared among the agents, allowing to learn to distributedly optimize over different networks. For both settings, our unfolded D-ADMM operates with limited communications, while preserving the interpretability and flexibility of the original D-ADMM algorithm. We specialize unfolded D-ADMM for two representative settings: a distributed estimation task, considering a sparse recovery setup, and a distributed learning scenario, where multiple agents collaborate in learning a machine learning model. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach dramatically reduces the number of communications utilized by D-ADMM, without compromising on its performance.

Abstract: This study investigates a decentralized linear-quadratic optimal control problem, and several approximate separable constrained optimization problems are formulated for the first time based on the selection of sparsity promoting functions. First, for the optimization problem with weighted $\ell_1$ sparsity promoting function, a two-timescale algorithm is adopted that is based on the BSUM (Block Successive Upper-bound Minimization) framework and a differential equation solver. Second, a piecewise quadratic sparsity promoting function is introduced, and the induced optimization problem demonstrates an accelerated convergence rate by performing the same two-timescale algorithm. Finally, the optimization problem with $\ell_0$ sparsity promoting function is considered that is nonconvex and discontinuous, and can be approximated by successive coordinatewise convex optimization problems.

Abstract: Blockchain-based games have introduced novel economic models that blend traditional gaming with decentralized ownership and financial incentives, leading to the rapid emergence of the GameFi sector. However, despite their innovative appeal, these games face significant challenges, particularly in terms of market stability, player retention, and the sustainability of token value. This paper explores the evolution of blockchain games and identifies key shortcomings in current tokenomics models using entropy increase theory. We propose two new models - ServerFi, which emphasizes Privatization through Asset Synthesis, and a model focused on Continuous Rewards for High-Retention Players. These models are formalized into mathematical frameworks and validated through group behavior simulation experiments. Our findings indicate that the ServerFi is particularly effective in maintaining player engagement and ensuring the long-term viability of the gaming ecosystem, offering a promising direction for future blockchain game development.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) represents a significant advancement in distributed machine learning, enabling multiple participants to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. This decentralized approach enhances privacy by keeping data on local devices. However, FL introduces new privacy challenges, as model updates shared during training can inadvertently leak sensitive information. This chapter delves into the core privacy concerns within FL, including the risks of data reconstruction, model inversion attacks, and membership inference. It explores various privacy-preserving techniques, such as Differential Privacy (DP) and Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), which are designed to mitigate these risks. The chapter also examines the trade-offs between model accuracy and privacy, emphasizing the importance of balancing these factors in practical implementations. Furthermore, it discusses the role of regulatory frameworks, such as GDPR, in shaping the privacy standards for FL. By providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of privacy in FL, this chapter aims to equip researchers and practitioners with the knowledge necessary to navigate the complexities of secure federated learning environments. The discussion highlights both the potential and limitations of existing privacy-enhancing techniques, offering insights into future research directions and the development of more robust solutions.

Abstract: Supply Chain Finance is very important for supply chain competition, which is an important tool to activate the capital flow in the supply chain. Supply Chain Finance-related research can support multiple applications and services, such as providing accounts receivable financing, enhancing risk management, and optimizing supply chain management. For more than a decade, the development of Blockchain has attracted widely attention in various fields, especially in finance. With the characteristics of data tamper-proof, forgery-proof, cryptography, consensus verification, and decentralization, Blockchain fits well with the realistic needs of Supply Chain Finance, which requires data integrity, authenticity, privacy, and information sharing. Therefore, it is time to summarize the applications of Blockchain technology in the field of Supply Chain Finance. What Blockchain technology brings to Supply Chain Finance is not only to alleviate the problems of information asymmetry, credit disassembly, and financing cost, but also to improve Supply Chain Finance operations through smart contracts to intelligent Supply Chain Finance and in combination with other technologies, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and data mining, jointly. So there has been some work in Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance research for different Supply Chain Finance oriented applications, but most of these work are at the management level to propose conceptual frameworks or simply use Blockchain without exploiting its deep applications. Moreover, there are few systematic reviews providing a comprehensive summary of current work in the area of Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance. In this paper, we ...

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized approach, enabling multiple participants to collaboratively train a model while ensuring the protection of data privacy. The transmission of updates from numerous edge clusters to the server creates a significant communication bottleneck in FL. Quantization is an effective compression technology, showcasing immense potential in addressing this bottleneck problem. The Non-IID nature of FL renders it sensitive to quantization. Existing quantized FL frameworks inadequately balance high compression ratios and superior convergence performance by roughly employing a uniform quantization bit-width on the client-side. In this work, we propose a communication-efficient FL algorithm with a fine-grained adaptive quantization strategy (FedFQ). FedFQ addresses the trade-off between achieving high communication compression ratios and maintaining superior convergence performance by introducing parameter-level quantization. Specifically, we have designed a Constraint-Guided Simulated Annealing algorithm to determine specific quantization schemes. We derive the convergence of FedFQ, demonstrating its superior convergence performance compared to existing quantized FL algorithms. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and demonstrated that, while maintaining lossless performance, FedFQ achieves a compression ratio of 27 times to 63 times compared to the baseline experiment.

Abstract: The aim of the work is to present an alternative approach to recording and evaluating student performance that enables sustainable performance recording with the possibility of integrating practical components in particular. The intended result is a digital portfolio with work samples - and not just certificates, which can be understood as a portfolio examination in the context of academic assessment. This is more about the recording, evaluation and certification of learning progress and competencies than the selective evaluation of a performance review, as is the case today, for example, with the submission of final theses. The idea is to expand and later replace final papers and performance tests, particularly in higher semesters, and instead introduce electronically recorded portfolio examinations - based on the example of teaching projects.
  Technologically, the approach is based on blockchain and wallets/repositories and, in the broadest sense, on an implementation of smart contracts. The technological approach of smart contracts enables a high degree of traceability and transparency with little administrative effort. It also offers secure certification of services by the provider. It should be clearly stated that neither the portfolio examination nor the administration of academic achievements with smart contracts is the original idea, but rather the change in the recording of academic achievements towards an alternative approach to the recording and evaluation of student performance, which enables sustainable performance recording with the possibility of integrating practical components in particular. The desired result is a digital portfolio with work samples.
  The primary aim of this idea sketch is to develop an individualized performance record for students, which can also contribute to making performance more transparent and comprehensible.

Abstract: This study introduces the Federated Medical Knowledge Injection (FEDMEKI) platform, a new benchmark designed to address the unique challenges of integrating medical knowledge into foundation models under privacy constraints. By leveraging a cross-silo federated learning approach, FEDMEKI circumvents the issues associated with centralized data collection, which is often prohibited under health regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the USA. The platform is meticulously designed to handle multi-site, multi-modal, and multi-task medical data, which includes 7 medical modalities, including images, signals, texts, laboratory test results, vital signs, input variables, and output variables. The curated dataset to validate FEDMEKI covers 8 medical tasks, including 6 classification tasks (lung opacity detection, COVID-19 detection, electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormal detection, mortality prediction, sepsis prediction, and enlarged cardiomediastinum detection) and 2 generation tasks (medical visual question answering (MedVQA) and ECG noise clarification). This comprehensive dataset is partitioned across several clients to facilitate the decentralized training process under 16 benchmark approaches. FEDMEKI not only preserves data privacy but also enhances the capability of medical foundation models by allowing them to learn from a broader spectrum of medical knowledge without direct data exposure, thereby setting a new benchmark in the application of foundation models within the healthcare sector.

Abstract: Fake News are a contemporary phenomenon with potential devastating effects. For inquiry and auditability purposes, it is essential that the news, once classified as false, can be persisted in an immutable means so that interested parties can query it. Although Blockchain clearly satisfies the main requirements for Fake News Management Software Systems, the prescriptive architectural solutions for that domain that cohabit Blockchain with other technologies in a single proposal still need to be made available. This paper's main contribution is presenting a prescriptive architectural solution for blockchain-based fake news management software systems. The Hoffmeister process for software architecture design is systematically followed to culminate in a software solution for that domain. The implementation of two candidate architectures and a brief simulation-based evaluation show the feasibility of the solution to satisfy the functional and quality requirements.

Abstract: In partially observable multi-agent systems, agents typically only have access to local observations. This severely hinders their ability to make precise decisions, particularly during decentralized execution. To alleviate this problem and inspired by image outpainting, we propose State Inference with Diffusion Models (SIDIFF), which uses diffusion models to reconstruct the original global state based solely on local observations. SIDIFF consists of a state generator and a state extractor, which allow agents to choose suitable actions by considering both the reconstructed global state and local observations. In addition, SIDIFF can be effortlessly incorporated into current multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms to improve their performance. Finally, we evaluated SIDIFF on different experimental platforms, including Multi-Agent Battle City (MABC), a novel and flexible multi-agent reinforcement learning environment we developed. SIDIFF achieved desirable results and outperformed other popular algorithms.

总结:

本文探讨了Federated Learning（FL）系统中整合新客户端所面临的挑战与机遇。FL作为一种分散式训练模型的新范式，允许在众多设备上进行学习，同时保护本地数据隐私。然而，FL系统的动态特性，包括不断加入具有不同数据分布和计算能力的新客户端，对系统稳定性和效率构成了重大挑战。文章深入分析了数据异质性如何影响模型训练、系统效能、可扩展性和稳定性。

尽管面临这些挑战，将新客户端集成到FL系统中提供了增强数据多样性、提高学习性能以及利用分布式计算资源的机会。相较于其他领域，如Gboard等应用中的分布式优化，生产环境中通常只有少数客户端，因此每个新客户端的信息变得尤为重要。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) represents a paradigm shift in the field of machine learning, offering an approach for a decentralized training of models across a multitude of devices while maintaining the privacy of local data. However, the dynamic nature of FL systems, characterized by the ongoing incorporation of new clients with potentially diverse data distributions and computational capabilities, poses a significant challenge to the stability and efficiency of these distributed learning networks. The seamless integration of new clients is imperative to sustain and enhance the performance and robustness of FL systems. This paper looks into the complexities of integrating new clients into existing FL systems and explores how data heterogeneity and varying data distribution (not independent and identically distributed) among them can affect model training, system efficiency, scalability and stability. Despite these challenges, the integration of new clients into FL systems presents opportunities to enhance data diversity, improve learning performance, and leverage distributed computational power. In contrast to other fields of application such as the distributed optimization of word predictions on Gboard (where federated learning once originated), there are usually only a few clients in the production environment, which is why information from each new client becomes all the more valuable. This paper outlines strategies for effective client selection strategies and solutions for ensuring system scalability and stability. Using the example of images from optical quality inspection, it offers insights into practical approaches. In conclusion, this paper proposes that addressing the challenges presented by new client integration is crucial to the advancement and efficiency of distributed learning networks, thus paving the way for the adoption of Federated Learning in production environments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach to training machine learning models across decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy, particularly in manufacturing and shared production environments. However, the presence of data heterogeneity variations in data distribution, quality, and volume across different or clients and production sites, poses significant challenges to the effectiveness and efficiency of FL. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of heterogeneity in FL within the context of manufacturing, detailing the types and sources of heterogeneity, including non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, unbalanced data, variable data quality, and statistical heterogeneity. We discuss the impact of these types of heterogeneity on model training and review current methodologies for mitigating their adverse effects. These methodologies include personalized and customized models, robust aggregation techniques, and client selection techniques. By synthesizing existing research and proposing new strategies, this paper aims to provide insight for effectively managing data heterogeneity in FL, enhancing model robustness, and ensuring fair and efficient training across diverse environments. Future research directions are also identified, highlighting the need for adaptive and scalable solutions to further improve the FL paradigm in the context of Industry 4.0.

Abstract: Decentralized learning recently has received increasing attention in machine learning due to its advantages in implementation simplicity and system robustness, data privacy. Meanwhile, the adaptive gradient methods show superior performances in many machine learning tasks such as training neural networks. Although some works focus on studying decentralized optimization algorithms with adaptive learning rates, these adaptive decentralized algorithms still suffer from high sample complexity. To fill these gaps, we propose a class of faster adaptive decentralized algorithms (i.e., AdaMDOS and AdaMDOF) for distributed nonconvex stochastic and finite-sum optimization, respectively. Moreover, we provide a solid convergence analysis framework for our methods. In particular, we prove that our AdaMDOS obtains a near-optimal sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution of nonconvex stochastic optimization. Meanwhile, our AdaMDOF obtains a near-optimal sample complexity of $O(\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-2})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution of nonconvex finite-sum optimization, where $n$ denotes the sample size. To the best of our knowledge, our AdaMDOF algorithm is the first adaptive decentralized algorithm for nonconvex finite-sum optimization. Some experimental results demonstrate efficiency of our algorithms.

Abstract: Smart contracts are widely utilized in cross-chain interactions, where their results are transmitted from one blockchain (the producer blockchain) to another (the consumer blockchain). Unfortunately, the consumer blockchain often accepts these results without executing the smart contracts for validation, posing potential security risks. To address this, we propose a method for validating cross-chain smart contract results. Our approach emphasizes consumer blockchain execution of cross-chain smart contracts of producer blockchain, allowing comparison of results with the transmitted ones to detect potential discrepancies and ensure data integrity during cross-chain data dissemination. Additionally, we introduce the confirmation with proof method, which involves incorporating the chain of blocks and relevant cross-chain smart contract data from the producer blockchain into the consumer blockchain as evidence (or proof), establishing a unified and secure perspective of cross-chain smart contract results. Our verification results highlight the feasibility of cross-chain validation at the smart contract level.

总结:

本文基于近期的人类学研究，揭示了芝加哥南区帮派动态的新变化，主要表现为分散的微帮派“组”以及跨帮派的人际网络成为当代社会的特征。然而，传统警方数据集缺乏深度，难以进行细致的帮派暴力分析。为解决这一问题，研究团队采用了自然语言处理技术，分析了一个芝加哥帮派论坛的文本信息。通过识别专有名词、概率链接到帮派“组”，并假设提及名字之间的社会联系，他们构建了一个包含271个体和11个帮派“组”的社交网络数据集。

进一步的研究利用Louvain社区检测方法发现，这些个体往往与来自地理位置相近帮派“组”的帮派关联同伴建立联系。通过层次逻辑回归分析，研究指出，与被谋杀者有联系以及在整体帮派网络中处于中心位置的个体，不论其所属帮派，都面临更高的被害风险。这项研究证明了利用在线社群信息可以探索以往难以触及的话题和群体，从而为深入理解帮派活动提供了一种新的研究途径。 <div>

Abstract: Recent ethnographic research reveals that gang dynamics in Chicago's Southside have evolved with decentralized micro-gang "set" factions and cross-gang interpersonal networks marking the contemporary landscape. However, standard police datasets lack the depth to analyze gang violence with such granularity. To address this, we employed a natural language processing strategy to analyze text from a Chicago gangs message board. By identifying proper nouns, probabilistically linking them to gang sets, and assuming social connections among names mentioned together, we created a social network dataset of 271 individuals across 11 gang sets. Using Louvain community detection, we found that these individuals often connect with gang-affiliated peers from various gang sets that are physically proximal. Hierarchical logistic regression revealed that individuals with ties to homicide victims and central positions in the overall gang network were at increased risk of victimization, regardless of gang affiliation. This research demonstrates that utilizing crowd-sourced information online can enable the study of otherwise inaccessible topics and populations.

本文针对当前智能合约模糊测试工具在效率和资源利用方面存在的问题，提出了一种名为Vulseye的状态导向灰盒模糊测试方法。Vulseye通过引入代码目标和状态目标，以及设计一种结合了代码空间和状态空间反馈的新型适应度度量，实现了对智能合约的高效、精准测试。与现有最先进的模糊测试工具相比，Vulseye在效果和效率上均表现出了显著优势。

Vulseye的主要创新点在于其状态导向的模糊测试策略。它通过优先测试更有可能存在漏洞的代码区域和状态，从而有效减少了对无害代码区域的资源浪费。此外，Vulseye利用静态分析和模式匹配来识别代码目标，采用可扩展的反向分析算法来指定状态目标。这种策略不仅提高了测试的针对性，还增强了模糊测试的全面性。

通过这些改进，Vulseye成功地解决了智能合约模糊测试中常见的资源分配不均和覆盖率不足的问题，为智能合约的安全性评估提供了更为高效和准确的手段。这将有助于提升用户资产的安全性和整体对去中心化系统的信任度。 <div>

Abstract: Smart contracts, the cornerstone of decentralized applications, have become increasingly prominent in revolutionizing the digital landscape. However, vulnerabilities in smart contracts pose great risks to user assets and undermine overall trust in decentralized systems. But current smart contract fuzzers fall short of expectations in testing efficiency for two primary reasons. Firstly, smart contracts are stateful programs, and existing approaches, primarily coverage-guided, lack effective feedback from the contract state. Consequently, they struggle to effectively explore the contract state space. Secondly, coverage-guided fuzzers, aiming for comprehensive program coverage, may lead to a wastage of testing resources on benign code areas. This wastage worsens in smart contract testing, as the mix of code and state spaces further complicates comprehensive testing.
  To address these challenges, we propose Vulseye, a stateful directed graybox fuzzer for smart contracts guided by vulnerabilities. Different from prior works, Vulseye achieves stateful directed fuzzing by prioritizing testing resources to code areas and contract states that are more prone to vulnerabilities. We introduce Code Targets and State Targets into fuzzing loops as the testing targets of Vulseye. We use static analysis and pattern matching to pinpoint Code Targets, and propose a scalable backward analysis algorithm to specify State Targets. We design a novel fitness metric that leverages feedback from both the contract code space and state space, directing fuzzing toward these targets. With the guidance of code and state targets, Vulseye alleviates the wastage of testing resources on benign code areas and achieves effective stateful fuzzing. In comparison with state-of-the-art fuzzers, Vulseye demonstrated superior effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Natural or man-made disasters pose significant challenges for delivering critical relief to affected populations due to disruptions in critical infrastructures and logistics networks. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-aided disaster relief networks (UDRNs) leverage UAVs to assist existing ground relief networks by swiftly assessing affected areas and timely delivering lifesaving supplies. To meet the growing demands for collaborative, trust-free, and transparent UDRN services, blockchain-based UDRNs emerge as a promising approach through immutable ledgers and distributed smart contracts. However, several efficiency and security challenges hinder the deployment of blockchain-based UDRNs, including the lack of cooperation between smart contracts, lack of dynamic audit for smart contract vulnerabilities, and low forensics robustness against transaction malleability attacks. Towards efficient and secure blockchain-based UDRNs, this paper presents potential solutions: (i) a series of collaborative smart contracts for coordinated relief management, (ii) a dynamic contract audit mechanism to prevent known/unknown contract vulnerabilities; and (iii) a robust transaction forensics strategy with on/off-chain cooperation to resist transaction malleability attacks. Our prototype implementation and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Lastly, we outline key open research issues crucial to advancing this emerging field.

Abstract: Vast industrial investment along with increased academic research on hydraulic heavy-duty manipulators has unavoidably paved the way for their automatization, necessitating the design of robust and high-precision controllers. In this study, an orchestrated robust controller is designed to address the mentioned issue for a generic manipulator with an anthropomorphic arm and spherical wrist. To do so, the entire robotic system is decomposed into subsystems, and a robust controller is designed at each local subsystem by considering unknown model uncertainties, unknown disturbances, and compound input nonlinearities, thanks to virtual decomposition control (VDC). As such, radial basic function neural networks (RBFNNs) are incorporated into VDC to tackle unknown disturbances and uncertainties, resulting in novel decentralized RBFNNs. All robust local controllers designed at each local subsystem, then, are orchestrated to accomplish high-precision control. In the end, for the first time in the context of VDC, a semi-globally uniformly ultimate boundedness is achieved under the designed controller. The validity of the theoretical results is verified by performing extensive simulations and experiments on a 6-degrees-of-freedom industrial manipulator with a nominal lifting capacity of 600 kg at 5 meters reach. Comparing the simulation result to the state-of-the-art controller along with provided experimental results, demonstrates that proposed method established all promises and performed excellently.

总结:

本文探讨了在快速发展的区块链系统背景下，高效智能合约开发与维护的重要性。随着技术进步，对智能合约进行有效管理的需求日益凸显，而智能合约代码摘要能够显著提升这一过程的效率并降低潜在风险。然而，当前大型语言模型（LLMs）如GPT-4和Gemini-1.5-Pro在生成代码摘要方面仍存在局限性，其性能低于通过微调构建的模型（如CodeT5+、CodeBERT）。针对此问题，本文提出了一种名为SCLA的框架，该框架结合了LLM与语义增强技术，旨在提升代码摘要性能。

SCLA通过构建智能合约的抽象语法树（AST）来提取潜在语义信息，并以此为基础形成具有语义增强的提示。为了评估其效果，研究者利用了一个由4万份真实世界智能合约组成的大型数据集。实验结果显示，SCLA在生成高质量代码摘要方面表现出色，其BLEU-4、METEOR、ROUGE-L以及BLEURT指标分别达到37.53%、52.54%、56.97%和63.44%，远超当前领先模型（如CodeBERT、CodeT5和CodeT5+）的表现。这表明，SCLA框架通过改进提示策略，显著提升了大型语言模型在智能合约代码摘要任务上的表现。 <div>

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving world of blockchain systems, the efficient development and maintenance of smart contracts has become a critical task. Smart contract code summarization can significantly facilitate the maintenance of smart contracts and mitigate their vulnerabilities. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro, possess the capability to generate code summarizations from code examples embedded in prompts. However, the performance of LLMs in code summarization remains suboptimal compared to fine-tuning-based models (e.g., CodeT5+, CodeBERT). Therefore, we propose SCLA, a framework leveraging LLMs and semantic augmentation to improve code summarization performance. SCLA constructs the smart contract's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to extract latent semantics, thereby forming a semantically augmented prompt. For evaluation, we utilize a large-scale dataset comprising 40,000 real-world contracts. Experimental results demonstrate that SCLA, with its enhanced prompt, significantly improves the quality of code summarizations. SCLA surpasses other state-of-the-art models (e.g., CodeBERT, CodeT5, and CodeT5+), achieving 37.53% BLEU-4, 52.54% METEOR, 56.97% ROUGE-L, and 63.44% BLEURT, respectively.

<div> 关键词：智能合约、大型语言模型、审计、细调、iAudit框架

总结:
本文提出了一种名为iAudit的通用框架，旨在通过结合细调和基于大型语言模型（LLM）的代理来实现直观的智能合约审计及原因说明。iAudit灵感来源于专家审计员的审计流程，即首先感知潜在问题，然后深入分析代码以识别漏洞原因。该框架采用两阶段细调策略：首先对决策模型进行细调，然后对原因生成模型进行细调。然而，单纯的细调面临准确识别漏洞根本原因的挑战。因此，引入了两个LLM代理——排序器和批评者——通过迭代选择并辩论最合适的漏洞原因，基于细调后原因生成模型的输出。为了评估iAudit的效果，研究团队收集了一个平衡的数据集，包含1,734个正样本和1,810个负样本，用于细调iAudit。与传统的细调模型（如CodeBERT、GraphCodeBERT、CodeT5和UnixCoder）以及基于提示学习的LLM（如GPT4、GPT-3.5和CodeLlama-13b/34b）进行了对比。在包含263个真实智能合约漏洞的数据集上，iAudit实现了91.21%的F1得分和91.11%的准确性。iAudit生成的原因与真实原因的一致性约为38%。通过这一框架，研究团队展示了如何利用LLM和细调技术提升智能合约审计的效率和精确度。 <div>

Abstract: Smart contracts are decentralized applications built atop blockchains like Ethereum. Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) have potential in auditing smart contracts, but the state-of-the-art indicates that even GPT-4 can achieve only 30% precision (when both decision and justification are correct). This is likely because off-the-shelf LLMs were primarily pre-trained on a general text/code corpus and not fine-tuned on the specific domain of Solidity smart contract auditing.
  In this paper, we propose iAudit, a general framework that combines fine-tuning and LLM-based agents for intuitive smart contract auditing with justifications. Specifically, iAudit is inspired by the observation that expert human auditors first perceive what could be wrong and then perform a detailed analysis of the code to identify the cause. As such, iAudit employs a two-stage fine-tuning approach: it first tunes a Detector model to make decisions and then tunes a Reasoner model to generate causes of vulnerabilities. However, fine-tuning alone faces challenges in accurately identifying the optimal cause of a vulnerability. Therefore, we introduce two LLM-based agents, the Ranker and Critic, to iteratively select and debate the most suitable cause of vulnerability based on the output of the fine-tuned Reasoner model. To evaluate iAudit, we collected a balanced dataset with 1,734 positive and 1,810 negative samples to fine-tune iAudit. We then compared it with traditional fine-tuned models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, and UnixCoder) as well as prompt learning-based LLMs (GPT4, GPT-3.5, and CodeLlama-13b/34b). On a dataset of 263 real smart contract vulnerabilities, iAudit achieves an F1 score of 91.21% and an accuracy of 91.11%. The causes generated by iAudit achieved a consistency of about 38% compared to the ground truth causes.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Semi-Centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (SCMARL) approach for irrigation scheduling in spatially variable agricultural fields, where management zones address spatial variability. The SCMARL framework is hierarchical in nature, with a centralized coordinator agent at the top level and decentralized local agents at the second level. The coordinator agent makes daily binary irrigation decisions based on field-wide conditions, which are communicated to the local agents. Local agents determine appropriate irrigation amounts for specific management zones using local conditions. The framework employs state augmentation approach to handle non-stationarity in the local agents' environments. An extensive evaluation on a large-scale field in Lethbridge, Canada, compares the SCMARL approach with a learning-based multi-agent model predictive control scheduling approach, highlighting its enhanced performance, resulting in water conservation and improved Irrigation Water Use Efficiency (IWUE). Notably, the proposed approach achieved a 4.0% savings in irrigation water while enhancing the IWUE by 6.3%.

Abstract: In the era of advanced artificial intelligence, highlighted by large-scale generative models like GPT-4, ensuring the traceability, verifiability, and reproducibility of datasets throughout their lifecycle is paramount for research institutions and technology companies. These organisations increasingly rely on vast corpora to train and fine-tune advanced AI models, resulting in intricate data supply chains that demand effective data governance mechanisms. In addition, the challenge intensifies as diverse stakeholders may use assorted tools, often without adequate measures to ensure the accountability of data and the reliability of outcomes. In this study, we adapt the concept of ``Software Bill of Materials" into the field of data governance and management to address the above challenges, and introduce ``Data Bill of Materials" (DataBOM) to capture the dependency relationship between different datasets and stakeholders by storing specific metadata. We demonstrate a platform architecture for providing blockchain-based DataBOM services, present the interaction protocol for stakeholders, and discuss the minimal requirements for DataBOM metadata. The proposed solution is evaluated in terms of feasibility and performance via case study and quantitative analysis respectively.

Abstract: Business process simulation (BPS) is a versatile technique for estimating process performance across various scenarios. Traditionally, BPS approaches employ a control-flow-first perspective by enriching a process model with simulation parameters. Although such approaches can mimic the behavior of centrally orchestrated processes, such as those supported by workflow systems, current control-flow-first approaches cannot faithfully capture the dynamics of real-world processes that involve distinct resource behavior and decentralized decision-making. Recognizing this issue, this paper introduces AgentSimulator, a resource-first BPS approach that discovers a multi-agent system from an event log, modeling distinct resource behaviors and interaction patterns to simulate the underlying process. Our experiments show that AgentSimulator achieves state-of-the-art simulation accuracy with significantly lower computation times than existing approaches while providing high interpretability and adaptability to different types of process-execution scenarios.

Abstract: Decentralized optimization has become a standard paradigm for solving large-scale decision-making problems and training large machine learning models without centralizing data. However, this paradigm introduces new privacy and security risks, with malicious agents potentially able to infer private data or impair the model accuracy. Over the past decade, significant advancements have been made in developing secure decentralized optimization and learning frameworks and algorithms. This survey provides a comprehensive tutorial on these advancements. We begin with the fundamentals of decentralized optimization and learning, highlighting centralized aggregation and distributed consensus as key modules exposed to security risks in federated and distributed optimization, respectively. Next, we focus on privacy-preserving algorithms, detailing three cryptographic tools and their integration into decentralized optimization and learning systems. Additionally, we examine resilient algorithms, exploring the design and analysis of resilient aggregation and consensus protocols that support these systems. We conclude the survey by discussing current trends and potential future directions.

本文研究了分散式双侧匹配市场的在线学习问题，其中需求方（玩家）与供给方（臂）进行匹配。与以往工作相比，本文不假设手臂预先知道其对玩家的偏好排序（单向学习），并且不假设任何结构化问题假设。主要贡献包括：

3. **对比分析**：文章还提出了一种基于黑板通信的基线算法，该算法在$T$的对数级别上实现了后悔。

4. **创新点**：该研究解决了没有预设手臂偏好排序的情况下分散式双侧匹配市场的在线学习问题，提供了高效的学习策略，同时通过比较分析展示了不同方法的性能差异。

Abstract: Online learning in a decentralized two-sided matching markets, where the demand-side (players) compete to match with the supply-side (arms), has received substantial interest because it abstracts out the complex interactions in matching platforms (e.g. UpWork, TaskRabbit). However, past works assume that each arm knows their preference ranking over the players (one-sided learning), and each player aim to learn the preference over arms through successive interactions. Moreover, several (impractical) assumptions on the problem are usually made for theoretical tractability such as broadcast player-arm match Liu et al. (2020; 2021); Kong & Li (2023) or serial dictatorship Sankararaman et al. (2021); Basu et al. (2021); Ghosh et al. (2022). In this paper, we study a decentralized two-sided matching market, where we do not assume that the preference ranking over players are known to the arms apriori. Furthermore, we do not have any structural assumptions on the problem. We propose a multi-phase explore-then-commit type algorithm namely epoch-based CA-ETC (collision avoidance explore then commit) (\texttt{CA-ETC} in short) for this problem that does not require any communication across agents (players and arms) and hence decentralized. We show that for the initial epoch length of $T_{\circ}$ and subsequent epoch-lengths of $2^{l/\gamma} T_{\circ}$ (for the $l-$th epoch with $\gamma \in (0,1)$ as an input parameter to the algorithm), \texttt{CA-ETC} yields a player optimal expected regret of $\mathcal{O}\left(T_{\circ} (\frac{K \log T}{T_{\circ} \Delta^2})^{1/\gamma} + T_{\circ} (\frac{T}{T_{\circ}})^\gamma\right)$ for the $i$-th player, where $T$ is the learning horizon, $K$ is the number of arms and $\Delta$ is an appropriately defined problem gap. Furthermore, we propose a blackboard communication based baseline achieving logarithmic regret in $T$.

Abstract: Smart contracts are a major tool in Ethereum transactions. Therefore hackers can exploit them by adding code vulnerabilities to their sources and using these vulnerabilities for performing malicious transactions. This paper presents two successful approaches for detecting malicious contracts: one uses opcode and relies on GPT2 and the other uses the Solidity source and a LORA fine-tuned CodeLlama. Finally, we present an XGBOOST model that combines gas properties and Hexa-decimal signatures for detecting malicious transactions. This approach relies on early assumptions that maliciousness is manifested by the uncommon usage of the contracts' functions and the effort to pursue the transaction.

总结:

本文探讨了在需要作出大量决策的环境中实现公平集体决策的问题，特别关注于二元决策（是/否）及其对参与个体的个体保障。研究引入了一种新颖的概念，灵感来源于公平分配中的最大化最小份额（MMS）。这一概念设想每个参与者都希望获得与他们最佳划分决策给其他参与者相匹配的数量，而决策的分配则由假设的对手决定。

研究中提出了针对3名参与者的在线算法以确保MMS原则，以及针对4名参与者的离线算法。然而，对于7名或更多参与者的情况，证明了没有在线算法能够确保适应性MMS原则。此外，研究还揭示了最大纳什福利（MNW）结果在最坏情况下的表现只能达到MMS原则的大约1/n。

总的来说，这篇论文为理解复杂决策环境中的公平性提供了新的视角和方法，特别是通过引入和分析最大化最小份额概念，以及探讨在线和离线算法在不同参与者数量下的性能，为设计更公平的决策机制提供了理论基础和实践指导。 <div>

We focus our attention on the binary case (YES/NO decisions) and \textit{individual} guarantees for each of the participating agents. We introduce a novel notion, inspired by the popular maxi-min-share (MMS) for fair allocation. The agent expects to get as many decisions as if they were to optimally partition the decisions among the agents, with an adversary deciding which of the agents decides on what bundle. We show an online algorithm that guarantees the MMS notion for $n=3$ agents, an offline algorithm for $n=4$ agents, and show that no online algorithm can guarantee the $MMS^{adapt}$ for $n\geq 7$ agents. We also show that the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) outcome can only guarantee $O(\frac{1}{n})$ of the MMS notion in the worst case.

<div> 关键词：Uniswap v3、战略流动性提供、神经网络优化框架、动态流动性提供问题、经济环境差异

总结:
本文探讨了Uniswap v3中流动性提供者（LP）的战略流动性提供问题。Uniswap v3允许LP将流动性分配到资产价格的特定区间，而非全价范围，这种设计引入了如何在风险与收益之间做出权衡的问题。当价格保持在指定区间内，流动性集中在该区间会带来较高的费用奖励，但同时也伴随着价格跳出该区间的高风险，导致可能无费用收入。

为了优化LP的收益，文章提出了一个基于神经网络的优化框架，用于解决动态流动性提供问题。该框架旨在为LP设计策略，以最大化其收益。通过模拟LP面临的历史价格变化序列，研究揭示了在不同经济环境下，最优LP行为的质性差异，并展示了与现有分配策略基线相比，该方法能显著提高LP的收益。

此研究不仅提供了对动态流动性管理的深入理解，也为LP在不确定市场环境中优化资源分配提供了实用工具。通过实验验证，证明了所提出的神经网络优化框架的有效性和实用性，为DeFi领域流动性管理策略的发展提供了新的视角和方法。 <div>

Abstract: Uniswap v3 is the largest decentralized exchange for digital currencies. A novelty of its design is that it allows a liquidity provider (LP) to allocate liquidity to one or more closed intervals of the price of an asset instead of the full range of possible prices. An LP earns fee rewards proportional to the amount of its liquidity allocation when prices move in this interval. This induces the problem of {\em strategic liquidity provision}: smaller intervals result in higher concentration of liquidity and correspondingly larger fees when the price remains in the interval, but with higher risk as prices may exit the interval leaving the LP with no fee rewards. Although reallocating liquidity to new intervals can mitigate this loss, it comes at a cost, as LPs must expend gas fees to do so. We formalize the dynamic liquidity provision problem and focus on a general class of strategies for which we provide a neural network-based optimization framework for maximizing LP earnings. We model a single LP that faces an exogenous sequence of price changes that arise from arbitrage and non-arbitrage trades in the decentralized exchange. We present experimental results informed by historical price data that demonstrate large improvements in LP earnings over existing allocation strategy baselines. Moreover we provide insight into qualitative differences in optimal LP behaviour in different economic environments.

<div> 关键词：联邦强化学习、多任务设置、私有奖励函数、过渡核共享、全局最优策略

总结:

本文研究了联邦强化学习（Federated Reinforcement Learning, FRL）在多任务场景下的应用。在多任务设置中，每个代理拥有其特定的任务奖励函数，但共享相同的环境过渡核。目标是在分布式环境下，通过不共享本地数据轨迹的方式，学习能够最大化所有代理总奖励之和的全局最优策略。

首先，针对无限时区马尔科夫决策过程，文章提出了一种基于softmax参数化的联邦范式和熵正则化自然策略梯度方法。为了减轻信息共享不完美的影响，采用了梯度跟踪技术来估计全局Q函数。通过理论分析，文章给出了在精确策略评估下非渐进收敛的保证，并揭示了网络规模和连通性对收敛速度的影响。这是首次在联邦多任务强化学习中使用策略优化方法建立接近维度无关的全局收敛性。

其次，文章超越了表格设置，提出了联邦自然演员评论者（Federated Natural Actor Critic, FNAC）方法，用于具有功能近似的多任务强化学习。考虑到函数逼近误差，该方法建立了其有限时间样本复杂性。通过这一方法，文章为多任务强化学习提供了更广泛的应用场景，特别是当涉及复杂环境或大规模状态空间时，能够有效利用有限的数据资源进行策略学习。

总的来说，本文为联邦多任务强化学习领域提供了重要的理论基础和实践指导，不仅丰富了强化学习的分布式学习框架，也为解决实际世界中的大规模、分布式决策问题提供了新的思路和方法。 <div>

Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (RL) enables collaborative decision making of multiple distributed agents without sharing local data trajectories. In this work, we consider a multi-task setting, in which each agent has its own private reward function corresponding to different tasks, while sharing the same transition kernel of the environment. Focusing on infinite-horizon Markov decision processes, the goal is to learn a globally optimal policy that maximizes the sum of the discounted total rewards of all the agents in a decentralized manner, where each agent only communicates with its neighbors over some prescribed graph topology.
  We develop federated vanilla and entropy-regularized natural policy gradient (NPG) methods in the tabular setting under softmax parameterization, where gradient tracking is applied to estimate the global Q-function to mitigate the impact of imperfect information sharing. We establish non-asymptotic global convergence guarantees under exact policy evaluation, where the rates are nearly independent of the size of the state-action space and illuminate the impacts of network size and connectivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that near dimension-free global convergence is established for federated multi-task RL using policy optimization. We further go beyond the tabular setting by proposing a federated natural actor critic (NAC) method for multi-task RL with function approximation, and establish its finite-time sample complexity taking the errors of function approximation into account.

<div> 关键词：Verifiable Delay Function（VDF）、Pietrzak VDF、Ethereum Virtual Machine（EVM）、优化、区块链环境

总结:

本文针对Verifiable Delay Function（VDF）在区块链环境中的应用进行了深入研究，特别关注了Pietrzak提出的VDF协议。传统上，该协议存在证明大小长和递归协议计算复杂的问题。为了克服这些问题，作者在以太坊虚拟机（EVM）上对Pietrzak VDF的验证过程进行了实施研究。

首先，通过仔细分析Pietrzak原始论文中关于计算成本的讨论，作者发现EVM中可以实现清晰的优化，因为计算成本是预先定义的，与特定的气体量相对应。这种优化使VDF验证的成本从4M降低到2M气体单位，显著提高了效率。

其次，通过优化计算流程，作者成功将使用2048位RSA密钥长度的VDF证明长度压缩至8KB以内，远低于预期。这一成果不仅降低了存储需求，还提高了整体系统性能，对于区块链等资源受限环境尤为关键。

综上所述，本文通过在EVM上的实施研究，展示了如何优化Pietrzak VDF协议，使其在区块链环境中更加高效、经济，为VDF技术的实际应用提供了有价值的参考。 <div>

Abstract: Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) is a cryptographic concept that ensures a minimum delay before output through sequential processing, which is resistant to parallel computing. One of the significant VDF protocols academically reviewed is the VDF protocol proposed by Pietrzak. However, for the blockchain environment, the Pietrzak VDF has drawbacks including long poof size and recursive protocol computation. In this paper, we present an implementation study of Pietrzak VDF verification on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). We found that the discussion in the Pietrzak's original paper can help a clear optimization in EVM where the costs of computation are predefined as the specific amounts of gas. In our results, the cost of VDF verification can be reduced from 4M to 2M gas, and the proof length can be generated under 8 KB with the 2048-bit RSA key length, which is much smaller than the previous expectation.

总结:
本文探讨了一种基于分散式系统的公平分割模型，灵感源自社区导向的目标设定、互助网络与社区资源管理。这种模型与传统的集中式公平分割框架相对比，旨在评估在分散与集中策略下资源分配的公平性与社会福利保障。研究指出，现有文献中关于序列交换的模型由于无法实现理想结果而受到限制，而分散式模型则被视为这些约束条件下的放松。在模拟现实世界场景的设定下，两种资源分配模式展现出不同的公平性和社会福利保障。特别地，该分散式模型在满足特定条件时，能够以高效的方式确保高质量的分配决策。这一发现强调了在实际应用中考虑分散式策略的重要性，尤其是在追求高效和公平的资源管理情境中。 <div>

Abstract: Fair division is typically framed from a centralized perspective. We study a decentralized variant of fair division inspired by the dynamics observed in community-based targeting, mutual aid networks, and community resource management paradigms. We develop an approach for decentralized fair division and compare it with a centralized approach with respect to fairness and social welfare guarantees. In the context of the existing literature, our decentralized model can be viewed as a relaxation of previous models of sequential exchange in light of impossibility results concerning the inability of those models to achieve desirable outcomes. We find that in settings representative of many real world situations, the two models of resource allocation offer contrasting fairness and social welfare guarantees. In particular, we show that under appropriate conditions, our model of decentralized allocation can ensure high-quality allocative decisions in an efficient fashion.

总结:

本文探讨了在线环境下平衡匿名性和信任度的挑战。随着AI能力的增强，恶意行为者能够通过创建误导性的身份进行欺诈、传播虚假信息等行为，这加剧了平衡匿名性和信任度的难度。文章提出了一种新的解决方案——“人身份证明”(PHCs)，这是一种数字凭证，用户可以在不泄露个人信息的情况下证明自己是真实的人，而不是AI，以此向在线服务提供商展示其可信度。

与当前针对自动化欺骗的防御措施如CAPTCHAs相比，PHCs更有效地应对了高度拟人化的AI和可扩展性问题。然而，实施PHC系统也面临部署风险和设计挑战，包括隐私保护、安全性和用户接受度等问题。文章强调了在政策制定者、技术专家和标准机构考虑实施前，需要与公众进行充分讨论的重要性。 <div>

Abstract: Anonymity is an important principle online. However, malicious actors have long used misleading identities to conduct fraud, spread disinformation, and carry out other deceptive schemes. With the advent of increasingly capable AI, bad actors can amplify the potential scale and effectiveness of their operations, intensifying the challenge of balancing anonymity and trustworthiness online. In this paper, we analyze the value of a new tool to address this challenge: "personhood credentials" (PHCs), digital credentials that empower users to demonstrate that they are real people -- not AIs -- to online services, without disclosing any personal information. Such credentials can be issued by a range of trusted institutions -- governments or otherwise. A PHC system, according to our definition, could be local or global, and does not need to be biometrics-based. Two trends in AI contribute to the urgency of the challenge: AI's increasing indistinguishability (i.e., lifelike content and avatars, agentic activity) from people online, and AI's increasing scalability (i.e., cost-effectiveness, accessibility). Drawing on a long history of research into anonymous credentials and "proof-of-personhood" systems, personhood credentials give people a way to signal their trustworthiness on online platforms, and offer service providers new tools for reducing misuse by bad actors. In contrast, existing countermeasures to automated deception -- such as CAPTCHAs -- are inadequate against sophisticated AI, while stringent identity verification solutions are insufficiently private for many use-cases. After surveying the benefits of personhood credentials, we also examine deployment risks and design challenges. We conclude with actionable next steps for policymakers, technologists, and standards bodies to consider in consultation with the public.

总结:
本文研究了在软件定义网络(SDN)环境下，网络流量管理和资源分配的网络效能最大化(NUM)问题。针对大型企业管理和运营的云网络和数据中心网络中流量规模的日益增长，现有的集中式NUM算法主要关注于算法对流量数量的可扩展性，而忽略了效率问题。为此，作者设计了一种高效且可扩展的集中式NUM算法。

首先，通过构建平滑的效用函数和惩罚函数，将NUM问题转化为具有平滑目标函数的形式，从而可以应用Nesterov加速梯度法进行求解。理论分析证明了所提出方法的收敛速度为O(d/t^2)，这是在迭代次数t上最快的收敛速率，并且该方法在流量数量d上也表现出良好的可扩展性。

实验结果表明，该方法能够以更少的迭代次数获得准确的解决方案，并且在网络效能方面接近最优值，充分体现了其高效性和可扩展性的优势。 <div>

Abstract: Network utility maximization (NUM) is a well-studied problem for network traffic management and resource allocation. Because of the inherent decentralization and complexity of networks, most researches develop decentralized NUM algorithms.In recent years, the Software Defined Networking (SDN) architecture has been widely used, especially in cloud networks and inter-datacenter networks managed by large enterprises, promoting the design of centralized NUM algorithms. To cope with the large and increasing number of flows in such SDN networks, existing researches about centralized NUM focus on the scalability of the algorithm with respect to the number of flows, however the efficiency is ignored. In this paper, we focus on the SDN scenario, and derive a centralized, efficient and scalable algorithm for the NUM problem. By the designing of a smooth utility function and a smooth penalty function, we formulate the NUM problem with a smooth objective function, which enables the use of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method. We prove that the proposed method has $O(d/t^2)$ convergence rate, which is the fastest with respect to the number of iterations $t$, and our method is scalable with respect to the number of flows $d$ in the network. Experiments show that our method obtains accurate solutions with less iterations, and achieves close-to-optimal network utility.

<div> 关键词：燃气发电单元、快速调节能力、电力系统、天然气系统、实时经济调度

总结:

本文研究了具有快速调节能力的燃气发电单元（GFUs）在缓解可再生能源发电波动及增强电力系统（EPS）与天然气系统（NGS）耦合方面的作用。然而，这种紧密耦合也带来了不确定性传播的问题，对集成电气系统的实时调度构成了挑战。同时，NGS中的管道泄漏可能威胁到EPS的供电可靠性。针对这些问题，作者首先构建了一个考虑了NGS动态特性的燃气管道在不确定泄漏故障下的运行模型。

接着，提出了一种考虑不确定传播和管道泄漏不确定性的集成电气系统（IEGSs）实时经济调度（RTED）模型。为了解决复杂的大规模随机优化问题，提出了耦合边界动态调整区域（LCBDAR）的概念，用于描述连接GFUs的NGS边界动态特性。基于LCBDAR，提出了一种非迭代的分散式解决方案，将原始的随机RTED模型分解为两个子问题，分别由EPS和NGS操作者独立解决，以保护数据隐私。特别地，只需要NGS向EPS进行一次数据交互。

通过在不同规模的IEGS案例研究，验证了所提出方法的有效性。 <div>

Abstract: Gas-fired units (GFUs) with rapid regulation capabilities are considered an effective tool to mitigate fluctuations in the generation of renewable energy sources and have coupled electricity power systems (EPSs) and natural gas systems (NGSs) more tightly. However, this tight coupling leads to uncertainty propagation, a challenge for the real-time dispatch of such integrated electric and gas systems (IEGSs). Moreover, pipeline leakage failures in the NGS may threaten the electricity supply reliability of the EPS through GFUs. To address these problems, this paper first establishes an operational model considering gas pipeline dynamic characteristics under uncertain leakage failures for the NGS and then presents a stochastic IEGS real-time economic dispatch (RTED) model considering both uncertainty propagation and pipeline leakage uncertainty. To quickly solve this complicated large-scale stochastic optimization problem, a novel notion of the coupling boundary dynamic adjustment region considering pipeline leakage failure (LCBDAR) is proposed to characterize the dynamic characteristics of the NGS boundary connecting GFUs. Based on the LCBDAR, a noniterative decentralized solution is proposed to decompose the original stochastic RTED model into two subproblems that are solved separately by the EPS and NGS operators, thus preserving their data privacy. In particular, only one-time data interaction from the NGS to the EPS is required. Case studies on several IEGSs at different scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Point cloud streaming is increasingly getting popular, evolving into the norm for interactive service delivery and the future Metaverse. However, the substantial volume of data associated with point clouds presents numerous challenges, particularly in terms of high bandwidth consumption and large storage capacity. Despite various solutions proposed thus far, with a focus on point cloud compression, upsampling, and completion, these reconstruction-related methods continue to fall short in delivering high fidelity point cloud output. As a solution, in DiffPMAE, we propose an effective point cloud reconstruction architecture. Inspired by self-supervised learning concepts, we combine Masked Auto-Encoding and Diffusion Model mechanism to remotely reconstruct point cloud data. By the nature of this reconstruction process, DiffPMAE can be extended to many related downstream tasks including point cloud compression, upsampling and completion. Leveraging ShapeNet-55 and ModelNet datasets with over 60000 objects, we validate the performance of DiffPMAE exceeding many state-of-the-art methods in-terms of auto-encoding and downstream tasks considered.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Segmentation of medical data, concerns about personal health information (PHI) breaches, and the direct and indirect costs of consolidating and managing such segmented date should motivate diagnostic machine learning (DML) researchers to identify privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms that can train on distributed or decentralized datasets of different modalities. Federated learning models provide such a decentralized machine learning framework in which multiple investigators in possession of disparate datasets and working on different devices or servers can train collaboratively a global machine learning models without ever having to exchange local data and thus can meet statutory PHI protections. To this end, a vertical federate learning model is devised and tested for efficacy in the detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
  METHODS: The second version of Open Access Series of Imaging Studies -- with its panoply of demographic, imaging, and clinical assessment datasets -- was used to test a multimodal vertical federated learning (VFL) model for AD detection.
  RESULTS: By training and validating this VFL model on the demographic, clinical, and MRI data in OASIS-2, an 82.9\% accuracy rate is achieved, consistent with previously reported results.
  CONCLUSIONS: The VFL architecture proposed herein offers a novel distributed architecture, enabling collaborative learning across diverse sources of medical data while respecting statutory privacy constraints. By leveraging multiple modalities of data, the robustness and accuracy of AD detection can be enhanced. This model not only contributes to the advancement of federated learning techniques but also holds promise for overcoming the hurdles posed by data segmentation in medical research.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) addresses the challenges posed by data silos, which arise from privacy, security regulations, and ownership concerns. Despite these barriers, FL enables these isolated data repositories to participate in collaborative learning without compromising privacy or security. Concurrently, the advancement of blockchain technology and decentralized applications (DApps) within Web 3.0 heralds a new era of transformative possibilities in web development. As such, incorporating FL into Web 3.0 paves the path for overcoming the limitations of data silos through collaborative learning. However, given the transaction speed constraints of core blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH) and the latency in smart contracts, employing one-shot FL, which minimizes client-server interactions in traditional FL to a single exchange, is considered more apt for Web 3.0 environments. This paper presents a practical one-shot FL system for Web 3.0, termed OFL-W3. OFL-W3 capitalizes on blockchain technology by utilizing smart contracts for managing transactions. Meanwhile, OFL-W3 utilizes the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) coupled with Flask communication, to facilitate backend server operations to use existing one-shot FL algorithms. With the integration of the incentive mechanism, OFL-W3 showcases an effective implementation of one-shot FL on Web 3.0, offering valuable insights and future directions for AI combined with Web 3.0 studies.

Abstract: In the era of Web3, decentralized technologies have emerged as the cornerstone of a new digital paradigm. Backed by a decentralized blockchain architecture, the Web3 space aims to democratize all aspects of the web. From data-sharing to learning models, outsourcing computation is an established, prevalent practice. Verifiable computation makes this practice trustworthy as clients/users can now efficiently validate the integrity of a computation. As verifiable computation gets considered for applications in the Web3 space, decentralization is crucial for system reliability, ensuring that no single entity can suppress clients. At the same time, however, decentralization needs to be balanced with efficiency: clients want their computations done as quickly as possible.
  Motivated by these issues, we study the trade-off between decentralization and efficiency when outsourcing computational tasks to strategic, rational solution providers. Specifically, we examine this trade-off when the client employs (1) revelation mechanisms, i.e. auctions, where solution providers bid their desired reward for completing the task by a specific deadline and then the client selects which of them will do the task and how much they will be rewarded, and (2) simple, non-revelation mechanisms, where the client commits to the set of rules she will use to map solutions at specific times to rewards and then solution providers decide whether they want to do the task or not. We completely characterize the power and limitations of revelation and non-revelation mechanisms in our model.

Abstract: Microgrids offer increased self-reliance and resilience at the grid's edge. They promote a significant transition to decentralized and renewable energy production by optimizing the utilization of local renewable sources. However, to maintain stable operations under all conditions and harness microgrids' full economic and technological potential, it is essential to integrate with the bulk grid and neighboring microgrids seamlessly. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of Back-to-Back (BTB) converters as a pivotal technology for interfacing microgrids, hybrid AC/DC grids, and bulk grids, by leveraging a comprehensive phasor-domain model integrated into GridLAB-D. The phasor-domain model is computationally efficient for simulating BTB with bulk grids and networked microgrids. We showcase the versatility of BTB converters (an integrated Microgrid Building Block) by configuring a two-microgrid network from a modified IEEE 13-node distribution system. These microgrids are equipped with diesel generators, photovoltaic units, and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). The simulation studies are focused on use cases demonstrating dynamic decoupling and controlled support that a microgrid can provide via a BTB converter.

<div> 关键词：SigmaRL、多智能体强化学习、交通场景、信息密集观察、零射泛化

总结:

这篇论文提出了一种名为SigmaRL的开源、去中心化的框架，旨在提高连接和自动化车辆的运动规划中多智能体强化学习的样本效率与泛化能力。大多数强化学习代理在泛化方面存在局限性，往往只专注于特定情境。为了改善这一状况，作者引入了五种设计信息密集型观察的策略，这些策略适用于大多数交通场景的一般特征。通过在交叉路口对RL代理进行训练，并在完全未见过的交通场景（如新的交叉路口、上坡道和环岛）进行评估，以验证其泛化能力。

实验结果表明，使用信息密集型观察训练的RL代理能够在不到一小时的时间内完成单CPU训练，并且能够实现有效的零射泛化，即在未见过的情境下也能表现良好。此外，该研究还强调了观察设计在影响样本效率和泛化能力方面的关键作用，为未来的研究提供了一个重要的研究方向。 <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces an open-source, decentralized framework named SigmaRL, designed to enhance both sample efficiency and generalization of multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) for motion planning of connected and automated vehicles. Most RL agents exhibit a limited capacity to generalize, often focusing narrowly on specific scenarios, and are usually evaluated in similar or even the same scenarios seen during training. Various methods have been proposed to address these challenges, including experience replay and regularization. However, how observation design in RL affects sample efficiency and generalization remains an under-explored area. We address this gap by proposing five strategies to design information-dense observations, focusing on general features that are applicable to most traffic scenarios. We train our RL agents using these strategies on an intersection and evaluate their generalization through numerical experiments across completely unseen traffic scenarios, including a new intersection, an on-ramp, and a roundabout. Incorporating these information-dense observations reduces training times to under one hour on a single CPU, and the evaluation results reveal that our RL agents can effectively zero-shot generalize.

<div> 关键词：联邦学习、区块链、去学习、双链结构、继承模型

总结:
本文提出了Blockchained Federated Unlearning（BlockFUL）框架，旨在解决在联邦学习（FL）中进行去学习（unlearning）的挑战。BlockFUL采用了双链结构，包括实时链和归档链，以实现区块链环境下FL的去学习能力。该框架引入了并行和序列两种新的去学习范式，通过基于梯度上升的方法和重新训练的方法来执行去学习操作。

首先，BlockFUL通过在多个继承模型间建立高效共识操作，减少了数据依赖和操作开销，从而提高了去学习过程的性能。其次，基于梯度上升的去学习方法允许模型直接从历史记录中删除特定数据，而无需重建整个模型，进一步减少了计算成本。最后，重新训练的方法则侧重于在去除不希望的数据后，对模型进行局部调整，以保持其准确性。

通过在CIFAR-10和Fashion-MNIST数据集上使用AlexNet、ResNet18和MobileNetV2模型的广泛实验，验证了这些方法的有效性，证明了它们能够成功减少对数据的依赖和操作开销，从而显著提升BlockFUL整体性能。 <div>

Abstract: Unlearning in Federated Learning (FL) presents significant challenges, as models grow and evolve with complex inheritance relationships. This complexity is amplified when blockchain is employed to ensure the integrity and traceability of FL, where the need to edit multiple interlinked blockchain records and update all inherited models complicates the process.In this paper, we introduce Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a novel framework with a dual-chain structure comprising a live chain and an archive chain for enabling unlearning capabilities within Blockchained FL. BlockFUL introduces two new unlearning paradigms, i.e., parallel and sequential paradigms, which can be effectively implemented through gradient-ascent-based and re-training-based unlearning methods. These methods enhance the unlearning process across multiple inherited models by enabling efficient consensus operations and reducing computational costs. Our extensive experiments validate that these methods effectively reduce data dependency and operational overhead, thereby boosting the overall performance of unlearning inherited models within BlockFUL on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and MobileNetV2 models.

Abstract: This article describes a novel game structure for autonomously optimizing decentralized manufacturing systems with multi-objective optimization challenges, namely Distributed Stackelberg Strategies in State-Based Potential Games (DS2-SbPG). DS2-SbPG integrates potential games and Stackelberg games, which improves the cooperative trade-off capabilities of potential games and the multi-objective optimization handling by Stackelberg games. Notably, all training procedures remain conducted in a fully distributed manner. DS2-SbPG offers a promising solution to finding optimal trade-offs between objectives by eliminating the complexities of setting up combined objective optimization functions for individual players in self-learning domains, particularly in real-world industrial settings with diverse and numerous objectives between the sub-systems. We further prove that DS2-SbPG constitutes a dynamic potential game that results in corresponding converge guarantees. Experimental validation conducted on a laboratory-scale testbed highlights the efficacy of DS2-SbPG and its two variants, such as DS2-SbPG for single-leader-follower and Stack DS2-SbPG for multi-leader-follower. The results show significant reductions in power consumption and improvements in overall performance, which signals the potential of DS2-SbPG in real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper presents BFTBrain, a reinforcement learning (RL) based Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) system that provides significant operational benefits: a plug-and-play system suitable for a broad set of hardware and network configurations, and adjusts effectively in real-time to changing fault scenarios and workloads. BFTBrain adapts to system conditions and application needs by switching between a set of BFT protocols in real-time. Two main advances contribute to BFTBrain's agility and performance. First, BFTBrain is based on a systematic, thorough modeling of metrics that correlate the performance of the studied BFT protocols with varying fault scenarios and workloads. These metrics are fed as features to BFTBrain's RL engine in order to choose the best-performing BFT protocols in real-time. Second, BFTBrain coordinates RL in a decentralized manner which is resilient to adversarial data pollution, where nodes share local metering values and reach the same learning output by consensus. As a result, in addition to providing significant operational benefits, BFTBrain improves throughput over fixed protocols by $18\%$ to $119\%$ under dynamic conditions and outperforms state-of-the-art learning based approaches by $44\%$ to $154\%$.

<div> 关键词：智能合约、安全漏洞、陷阱门、定理携带交易（TCT）、静态代码验证

总结:

本文聚焦于解决智能合约领域中长期存在的安全问题，特别是针对以太坊社区的智能合约。研究发现，这些合约构成了一个庞大的程序，其行为由复杂的引用拓扑结构决定，这使得确保该程序符合设计级别的安全属性变得极为挑战。由于静态代码验证在面对如此大规模且高度多态的程序时显得力不从心，作者提出了一种名为“定理携带交易”（TCT）的技术路线图。

TCT结合了实际执行和符号证明的优点。在TCT协议下，每个交易都携带一个证明其遵循调用合约中指定属性的定理。运行时系统会在执行交易前检查此定理。一旦在合同中指定某个属性，它便被视为合同提供的无条件保证。通过这一方法，无需预见到代码层面的复杂性如整数溢出或重入等问题，就能确保令牌合约的安全性。此外，TCT成功应用于Uniswap代码库，展示了在复杂去中心化金融（DeFi）场景中的应用案例。

文章最后指出，尽管引入了TCT，但实际运行时的开销仅微乎其微，远低于当前最先进的方法，从而为智能合约领域的安全提供了显著的提升。 <div>

Abstract: Security bugs and trapdoors in smart contracts have been impacting the Ethereum community since its inception. Conceptually, the 1.45-million Ethereum's contracts form a single "gigantic program" whose behaviors are determined by the complex reference-topology between the contracts. Can the Ethereum community be assured that this gigantic program conforms to its design-level safety properties, despite unforeseeable code-level intricacies? Static code verification is inadequate due to the program's gigantic scale and high polymorphism. In this paper, we present a viable technological roadmap for the community toward this ambitious goal. Our technology, called Theorem-Carrying-Transaction (TCT), combines the benefits of concrete execution and symbolic proofs. Under the TCT protocol, every transaction carries a theorem that proves its adherence to the specified properties in the invoked contracts, and the runtime system checks the theorem before executing the transaction. Once a property is specified in a contract, it can be treated confidently as an unconditional guarantee made by the contract. As case studies, we demonstrate that TCT secures token contracts without foreseeing code-level intricacies like integer overflow and reentrancy. TCT is also successfully applied to a Uniswap codebase, showcasing a complex decentralized finance (DeFi) scenario. Our prototype incurs a negligible runtime overhead, two orders of magnitude lower than a state-of-the-art approach.

<br />
总结:

本文聚焦于多智能体强化学习（MARL）领域，针对多智能体系统中合作的重要性及其实现挑战。在现实世界应用中，多智能体系统的部署往往需要分散训练、多样化的智能体以及从稀疏环境奖励信号中学习的能力。特别是在部分可观测性和缺乏对智能体异质性先验知识的情况下，这些挑战更加突出。已有研究通过内在动机（IM）来解决分散设置中的奖励稀疏性或合作问题，但处理异质性时通常假设集中式训练、参数共享和智能体索引。

为了克服上述局限，本文提出了一种名为CoHet的算法。该算法利用基于图神经网络（GNN）的内在动机机制，旨在分散环境中学习异质智能体策略。CoHet在多智能体粒子环境（MPE）和向量化多智能体模拟器（VMAS）基准测试中，展示了在一系列合作多智能体场景中的优越性能，与现有最佳实践相比。

研究还深入分析了智能体动力学模型对内在动机模块的影响、不同CoHet变体的表现及其对增加的异质智能体数量的鲁棒性。这为理解如何有效设计和优化多智能体系统提供了宝贵的见解，特别是当面临异质性和部分可观测性等复杂挑战时。 <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is emerging as a key framework for various sequential decision-making and control tasks. Unlike their single-agent counterparts, multi-agent systems necessitate successful cooperation among the agents. The deployment of these systems in real-world scenarios often requires decentralized training, a diverse set of agents, and learning from infrequent environmental reward signals. These challenges become more pronounced under partial observability and the lack of prior knowledge about agent heterogeneity. While notable studies use intrinsic motivation (IM) to address reward sparsity or cooperation in decentralized settings, those dealing with heterogeneity typically assume centralized training, parameter sharing, and agent indexing. To overcome these limitations, we propose the CoHet algorithm, which utilizes a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) based intrinsic motivation to facilitate the learning of heterogeneous agent policies in decentralized settings, under the challenges of partial observability and reward sparsity. Evaluation of CoHet in the Multi-agent Particle Environment (MPE) and Vectorized Multi-Agent Simulator (VMAS) benchmarks demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art in a range of cooperative multi-agent scenarios. Our research is supplemented by an analysis of the impact of the agent dynamics model on the intrinsic motivation module, insights into the performance of different CoHet variants, and its robustness to an increasing number of heterogeneous agents.

总结:
本文通过物理仿真的多机器人环境ARGoS，研究了分散控制与集中控制在多机器人覆盖任务中的权衡。研究发现，分散控制提供了更好的可扩展性，但与预期相反，在随机障碍物环境中，分散控制的表现并不优于集中控制。通过将无人机作为监督者加入地面机器人的队伍，并逐步增加监督者使用集中控制的程度（包括全球信息访问和中央协调实体），研究比较了四种控制方法：分散控制、混合控制、集中控制和预设控制。

Abstract: In swarm robotics, decentralized control is often proposed as a more scalable and fault-tolerant alternative to centralized control. However, centralized behaviors are often faster and more efficient than their decentralized counterparts. In any given application, the goals and constraints of the task being solved should guide the choice to use centralized control, decentralized control, or a combination of the two. Currently, the tradeoffs that exist between centralization and decentralization have not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we investigate these tradeoffs for multi-robot coverage, and find that they are more nuanced than expected. For instance, our findings reinforce the expectation that more decentralized control will provide better scalability, but contradict the expectation that more decentralized control will perform better in environments with randomized obstacles. Beginning with a group of fully independent ground robots executing coverage, we add unmanned aerial vehicles as supervisors and progressively increase the degree to which the supervisors use centralized control, in terms of access to global information and a central coordinating entity. We compare, using the multi-robot physics-based simulation environment ARGoS, the following four control approaches: decentralized control, hybrid control, centralized control, and predetermined control. In comparing the ground robots performing the coverage task, we assess the speed and efficiency advantages of centralization -- in terms of coverage completeness and coverage uniformity -- and we assess the scalability and fault tolerance advantages of decentralization. We also assess the energy expenditure disadvantages of centralization due to different energy consumption rates of ground robots and unmanned aerial vehicles, according to the specifications of robots available off-the-shelf.

Abstract: The decentralized Federated Learning (FL) paradigm built upon blockchain architectures leverages distributed node clusters to replace the single server for executing FL model aggregation. This paradigm tackles the vulnerability of the centralized malicious server in vanilla FL and inherits the trustfulness and robustness offered by blockchain. However, existing blockchain-enabled schemes face challenges related to inadequate confidentiality on models and limited computational resources of blockchains to perform large-scale FL computations. In this paper, we present Voltran, an innovative hybrid platform designed to achieve trust, confidentiality, and robustness for FL based on the combination of the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and blockchain technology. We offload the FL aggregation computation into TEE to provide an isolated, trusted and customizable off-chain execution, and then guarantee the authenticity and verifiability of aggregation results on the blockchain. Moreover, we provide strong scalability on multiple FL scenarios by introducing a multi-SGX parallel execution strategy to amortize the large-scale FL workload. We implement a prototype of Voltran and conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Voltran incurs minimal additional overhead while guaranteeing trust, confidentiality, and authenticity, and it significantly brings a significant speed-up compared to state-of-the-art ciphertext aggregation schemes.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) aim to generate diverse trajectories from a distribution in which the final states of the trajectories are proportional to the reward, serving as a powerful alternative to reinforcement learning for exploratory control tasks. However, the individual-flow matching constraint in GFlowNets limits their applications for multi-agent systems, especially continuous joint-control problems. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Agent generative Continuous Flow Networks (MACFN) method to enable multiple agents to perform cooperative exploration for various compositional continuous objects. Technically, MACFN trains decentralized individual-flow-based policies in a centralized global-flow-based matching fashion. During centralized training, MACFN introduces a continuous flow decomposition network to deduce the flow contributions of each agent in the presence of only global rewards. Then agents can deliver actions solely based on their assigned local flow in a decentralized way, forming a joint policy distribution proportional to the rewards. To guarantee the expressiveness of continuous flow decomposition, we theoretically derive a consistency condition on the decomposition network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields results superior to the state-of-the-art counterparts and better exploration capability.

Abstract: Securely and efficiently procuring energy balancing services in distribution networks remains challenging, especially within a privacy-preserving environment. This paper proposes a network-constrained demand response game, i.e., a Generalized Nash Game (GNG), to incentivize energy consumers to offer balancing services. Specifically, we adopt a supply function-based bidding method for our demand response problem, where a requisite load adjustment must be met. To ensure the secure operation of distribution networks, we incorporate physical network constraints, including line capacity and bus voltage limits, into the game formulation. In addition, we analytically evaluate the efficiency loss of this game. Previous approaches to steer energy consumers toward the Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) of the game often necessitated sharing some private information, which might not be practically feasible or desired. To overcome this limitation, we propose a decentralized market clearing algorithm with analytical convergence guarantees, which only requires the participants to share limited, non-sensitive information with others. Numerical analyses illustrate that the proposed market mechanism exhibits a low market efficiency loss. Moreover, these analyses highlight the critical role of integrating physical network constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our proposed algorithm by conducting simulations on the IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus test systems.

Abstract: Logical clocks are a fundamental tool to establish causal ordering of events in a distributed system. They have been applied in weakly consistent storage systems, causally ordered broadcast, distributed snapshots, deadlock detection, and distributed system debugging. However, prior logical clock constructs fail to work in an open network with Byzantine participants. In this work, we present Chrono, a novel logical clock system that targets such challenging environment. We first redefine causality properties among distributed processes under the Byzantine failure model. To enforce these properties, Chrono defines a new validator abstraction for building fault-tolerant logical clocks. Furthermore, our validator abstraction is customizable: Chrono includes multiple backend implementations for the abstraction, each with different security-performance trade-offs. We have applied Chrono to build two decentralized applications, a mutual exclusive service and a weakly consistent key-value store. Chrono adds only marginal overhead compared to systems that tolerate no Byzantine faults. It also out-performs state-of-the-art BFT total order protocols by significant margins.

文章通过研究从2023年2月到2024年5月的五百万用户数据，对Bluesky这个新兴的去中心化社交媒体平台进行了深入分析。Bluesky在设计上具有独特性，并提供了前所未有的数据访问能力。研究发现，其互动网络展现出与大型社交网络相似的特征，如重尾分布、高聚类性和短路径连接。Bluesky引入了定制化的“feeds”功能，用于个性化内容推荐，但用户对此的采纳程度有限。在内容分享方面，Bluesky用户倾向于分享左中立场的新闻来源，避开了争议性或可疑新闻。然而，在涉及以色列-巴勒斯坦冲突的问题上，出现了明显的基于议题的分歧，支持巴勒斯坦的声音超过支持以色列的用户，并且比例有所增加。尽管Bluesky拥有创新特性，但其网络结构与现有的大型社交平台并无本质差异，为社会科学家、网络科学家和政治科学家提供了宝贵的研究机会。 <div>

Abstract: Bluesky is a nascent Twitter-like and decentralized social media network with novel features and unprecedented data access. This paper provides a characterization of its interaction network, studying the political leaning, polarization, network structure, and algorithmic curation mechanisms of five million users. The dataset spans from the website's first release in February of 2023 to May of 2024. We investigate the replies, likes, reposts, and follows layers of the Bluesky network. We find that all networks are characterized by heavy-tailed distributions, high clustering, and short connection paths, similar to other larger social networks. Bluesky introduced feeds - algorithmic content recommenders created for and by users. We analyze all feeds and find that while a large number of custom feeds have been created, users' uptake of them appears to be limited. We analyze the hyperlinks shared by Bluesky's users and find no evidence of polarization in terms of the political leaning of the news sources they share. They share predominantly left-center news sources and little to no links associated with questionable news sources. In contrast to the homogeneous political ideology, we find significant issues-based divergence by studying opinions related to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Two clear homophilic clusters emerge: Pro-Palestinian voices outnumber pro-Israeli users, and the proportion has increased. We conclude by claiming that Bluesky-for all its novel features - is very similar in its network structure to existing and larger social media sites and provides unprecedented research opportunities for social scientists, network scientists, and political scientists alike.

Abstract: Air pollutant exposure kills over 6,700,000 people it per annum, yet there remains a systemic lack of accurate ground level data reporting the concentrations of the leading causes of such fatalities. Ambient particulate matter is a primary driver of this effect. Namely, PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10.0 display a systemic lack of accurate and high-definition reporting. This project suggests and implements a prototype for a distributed and low cost model for reporting such data and designs a novel framework in order to remedy three main shortfalls of previously implemented systems. First, their central operation and distribution, and therefore their requirement of trust in a central governing body. Second, their requirement of the purchase of comparatively high-cost devices for ordinary consumers. Finally, their high degree of error and accordingly low functional certainty. This project explores the creation of AirChain, a prototype system utilizing blockchain technology that will demonstrate the effectiveness of low-cost sensors when paired with simple microcontroller devices.

总结:

本文系统地描述了自2019年至2023年间针对隐私导向加密货币Monero出现的追踪策略。文章重点分析了两种钱包应用漏洞——“差一”和“10区块诱饵漏洞”，以及一个名为P2Pool的去中心化挖矿池的兴起，还有Mordinals——一种有争议的UTXO NFT尝试。通过与实际数据对比和相互比较，研究评估了这些追踪策略的质量。结果表明大多数策略具有高精度，其中“10区块诱饵漏洞”和Coinbase诱饵识别策略在这段时间内影响最大。该研究还展示了随着时间推移，这些策略的有效性如何变化，以及在去除诱饵后剩余的有效环大小。最后，研究指出，“10区块诱饵漏洞”可用于评估未来策略，前提是它们在2019年至2023年期间同样适用。

Abstract: Privacy-focused cryptoassets like Monero are intentionally difficult to trace. Over the years, several traceability heuristics have been proposed, most of which have been rendered ineffective with subsequent protocol upgrades. Between 2019 and 2023, Monero wallet application bugs "Differ By One" and "10 Block Decoy Bug" have been observed and identified and discussed in the Monero community. In addition, a decentralized mining pool named P2Pool has proliferated, and a controversial UTXO NFT imitation known as Mordinals has been tried for Monero. In this paper, we systematically describe the traceability heuristics that have emerged from these developments, and evaluate their quality based on ground truth, and through pairwise comparisons. We also explore the temporal perspective, and show which of these heuristics have been applicable over the past years, what fraction of decoys could be eliminated and what the remaining effective ring size is. Our findings illustrate that most of the heuristics have a high precision, that the "10 Block Decoy Bug" and the Coinbase decoy identification heuristics have had the most impact between 2019 and 2023, and that the former could be used to evaluate future heuristics, if they are also applicable during that time frame.

<div> 关键词：区块链、投票委托、二元集体决策、投票权重分布、多数优势

<br /><br />
总结:

本文探讨了区块链中二元集体决策中投票委托的替代性好处。研究首先对比了两种极端的投票权重分布情况：等权重（EW），即每位投票者拥有相等的投票权重；与主导权重（DW），即在任何委托发生前，单一投票者持有投票权重的多数。研究揭示了在等权重情况下，投票委托倾向于使初始获胜概率较低的选项（即前验少数）受益。相反，在主导权重下，情况则相反。通过数值模拟，研究将发现扩展到任意的投票权重分布，表明在投票权重分布更加均衡时，投票委托使初始获胜概率较高的选项（即前验多数）受益。最后，在所有参与者都具有相同投票权重的大规模社区中，投票委托对结果的影响微乎其微。这些见解为区块链治理决策提供了实用指导。 <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates which alternative benefits from vote delegation in binary collective decisions within blockchains. We begin by examining two extreme cases of voting weight distributions: Equal-Weight (EW), where each voter has equal voting weight, and Dominant-Weight (DW), where a single voter holds a majority of the voting weights before any delegation occurs. We show that vote delegation tends to benefit the ex-ante minority under EW, i.e., the alternative with a lower initial probability of winning. The converse holds under DW distribution. Through numerical simulations, we extend our findings to arbitrary voting weight distributions, showing that vote delegation benefits the ex-ante majority when it leads to a more balanced distribution of voting weights. Finally, in large communities where all agents have equal voting weight, vote delegation has a negligible impact on the outcome. These insights provide practical guidance for governance decisions in blockchains.

<div> 关键词：Symbiotic Communication、Blockchain、6G、Energy Efficiency、Symbiotic Blockchain Network

<br /><br />
总结:

本文探讨了一种新型无线通信范式——共生通信（SC），它类似于自然生态系统中的物种相互依存关系，旨在使多个通信系统通过服务交换和资源共享实现合作与互惠。SC被视为解决第六代（6G）通信中频谱资源稀缺和能效低问题的重要潜在技术。然而，不同通信系统之间缺乏建立信任关系构成了确保SC框架内资源和服务交换高效可信的主要障碍。

针对这一挑战，作者提出了一种结合SC与区块链技术的解决方案——共生区块链网络（SBN）。首先，利用认知回波通信对区块链共识机制进行改造，形成共生区块链共识（SBC），使其更适应无线网络环境。接着，为SBC设计了一种高度节能的分片方案，以满足6G网络极低功耗的需求。最后，该区块链方案保证了SC中通信服务交易的可信性。

通过消融实验，所提出的SBN方案在对抗网络中显著降低了能量消耗和处理延迟，有望实现可持续和可信的6G无线网络。 <div>

Abstract: Symbiotic communication (SC) is known as a new wireless communication paradigm, similar to the natural ecosystem population, and can enable multiple communication systems to cooperate and mutualize through service exchange and resource sharing. As a result, SC is seen as an important potential technology for future sixth-generation (6G) communications, solving the problem of lack of spectrum resources and energy inefficiency. Symbiotic relationships among communication systems can complement radio resources in 6G. However, the absence of established trust relationships among diverse communication systems presents a formidable hurdle in ensuring efficient and trusted resource and service exchange within SC frameworks. To better realize trusted SC services in 6G, in this paper, we propose a solution that converges SC and blockchain, called a symbiotic blockchain network (SBN). Specifically, we first use cognitive backscatter communication to transform blockchain consensus, that is, the symbiotic blockchain consensus (SBC), so that it can be better suited for the wireless network. Then, for SBC, we propose a highly energy-efficient sharding scheme to meet the extremely low power consumption requirements in 6G. Finally, such a blockchain scheme guarantees trusted transactions of communication services in SC. Through ablation experiments, our proposed SBN demonstrates significant efficacy in mitigating energy consumption and reducing processing latency in adversarial networks, which is expected to achieve a sustainable and trusted 6G wireless network.

<div> 关键词：区块链平台、DApps、前端描述、后端智能合约、HYPERION

总结:

本文研究了区块链平台的快速发展对去中心化应用(DApps)的影响。主要关注的是DApps前端描述与后端智能合约之间的一致性问题。研究首先通过实证分析识别了七种类型的一致性差异，并以真实世界中的DApp为例进行了说明。然后，提出了一种名为HYPERION的方法，用于自动检测DApps中前端描述与后端代码实现之间的不一致。

HYPERION利用细调后的大型语言模型LLaMA2来分析DApp描述，并结合数据流导向的符号执行技术来解析合约字节码。该方法通过预定义的检测模式报告不一致性。在由54个DApps组成的基准数据集上的实验表明，HYPERION在报告DApp不一致性的总体召回率和精确度上分别达到了84.06%和92.06%。

为了验证其有效性，HYPERION还被应用于分析835个实际的DApps。结果发现，至少存在一种不一致性的DApps有459个。这一研究有助于提高用户对DApps的信任，并为开发者提供了一个有效的工具来确保前端描述与后端实现的一致性，从而提升DApps的质量和用户体验。 <div>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of blockchain platforms has significantly accelerated the growth of decentralized applications (DApps). Similar to traditional applications, DApps integrate front-end descriptions that showcase their features to attract users, and back-end smart contracts for executing their business logic. However, inconsistencies between the features promoted in front-end descriptions and those actually implemented in the contract can confuse users and undermine DApps's trustworthiness. In this paper, we first conducted an empirical study to identify seven types of inconsistencies, each exemplified by a real-world DApp. Furthermore, we introduce HYPERION, an approach designed to automatically identify inconsistencies between front-end descriptions and back-end code implementation in DApps. This method leverages a fine-tuned large language model LLaMA2 to analyze DApp descriptions and employs dataflow-guided symbolic execution for contract bytecode analysis. Finally, HYPERION reports the inconsistency based on predefined detection patterns. The experiment on our ground truth dataset consisting of 54 DApps shows that HYPERION reaches 84.06% overall recall and 92.06% overall precision in reporting DApp inconsistencies. We also implement HYPERION to analyze 835 real-world DApps. The experimental results show that HYPERION discovers 459 real-world DApps containing at least one inconsistency.

Abstract: While the blockchain-based smart contract has become a hot topic of research over the last decade, not the least in the context of Industry 4.0, it now has well-known legal and technical shortcomings that currently prohibit its real-world application. These shortcomings come from (1) that a smart contract is a computer program, not a document describing legal obligations, and (2) that blockchain-based systems are complicated to use and operate. In this paper, we present a refined and extended summary of our work taking key technologies from the blockchain sphere and applying them to the ricardian contract, which is a traditional contract in digital form with machine-readable parameters. By putting the ricardian contract in the context of our contract network architecture, we facilitate the infrastructure required for contracts to be offered, negotiated, performed, renegotiated and terminated in a completely digital and automatable fashion. Our architecture circumvents the legal issues of blockchains by facilitating an artifact very much alike a traditional contract, as well as its operational complexity by requiring consensus only between nodes representing directly involved parties. To demonstrate its utility, we also present how it could be used for (1) private data purchasing, (2) treasury management, (3) order-driven manufacturing and (4) automated device on-boarding.

<div> 关键词：Decentralized Intelligence Health Network（DIHN）、自主权、联邦学习（FL）、区块链、激励机制

总结:

《Decentralized Intelligence Health Network: 自主健康智能网络》一文提出了一种全新的理论框架——Decentralized Intelligence Health Network (DIHN)，旨在解决医疗数据主权和人工智能在医疗领域利用过程中因数据碎片化而产生的挑战。该框架首先构建了一个基于自主权的健康服务体系基础架构，以确保健康数据的主权性。其次，通过在公共区块链上实现可扩展的联邦学习协议，它克服了访问多样化的医疗数据来源的障碍，实现了分散的人工智能训练，同时确保了参与者的数据安全和隐私。

此外，DIHN还引入了一种可扩展、无信任的奖励机制，激励参与者的积极性，并确保奖励的公平分配。这一机制使得任何实体都无法阻止或控制对参与者提供的健康数据进行的训练过程，也无法决定由此产生的财务收益，因为这些操作都在不可篡改的公共区块链上进行。

患者通过参与联邦学习协议获得奖励，这不仅激励了他们的参与，还为他们提供了经济上的收益。长期规划还包括利用这种分散的生态系统为患者提供分散式保险解决方案的可能性。DIHN的实施将为医疗数据管理和人工智能应用带来变革，同时赋予患者控制权，从而实现更个性化、互补现有系统并重新定义全民覆盖的新型医疗保健模式。 <div>
arXiv:2408.06240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Intelligence Health Network (DIHN) is a theoretical framework addressing significant challenges of health data sovereignty and AI utilization in healthcare caused by data fragmentation across providers and institutions. It establishes a sovereign architecture for healthcare provision as a prerequisite to a sovereign health network, then facilitates effective AI utilization by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse medical data sources. This comprehensive framework leverages: 1) self-sovereign identity architecture coupled with a personal health record (PHR) as a prerequisite for health data sovereignty; 2) a scalable federated learning (FL) protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training in healthcare, where health data remains with participants and only model parameter updates are shared; and 3) a scalable, trustless rewards mechanism to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution. This framework ensures that no entity can prevent or control access to training on health data offered by participants or determine financial benefits, as these processes operate on a public blockchain with an immutable record and without a third party. It supports effective AI training in healthcare, allowing patients to maintain control over their health data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial healthcare algorithms. Patients receive rewards into their digital wallets as an incentive to opt-in to the FL protocol, with a long-term roadmap to funding decentralized insurance solutions. This approach introduces a novel, self-financed healthcare model that adapts to individual needs, complements existing systems, and redefines universal coverage. It highlights the potential to transform healthcare data management and AI utilization while empowering patients.

Abstract: The internet of things (IoT) and other emerging ubiquitous technologies are supporting the rapid spread of smart systems, which has underlined the need for safe, open, and decentralized data storage solutions. With its inherent decentralization and immutability, blockchain offers itself as a potential solution for these requirements. However, the practicality of incorporating blockchain into real-time sensor data storage systems is a topic that demands in-depth examination. While blockchain promises unmatched data security and auditability, some intrinsic qualities, namely scalability restrictions, transactional delays, and escalating storage demands, impede its seamless deployment in high-frequency, voluminous data contexts typical of real-time sensors. This essay launches a methodical investigation into these difficulties, illuminating their underlying causes, potential effects, and potential countermeasures. In addition, we present a novel pragmatic experimental setup and analysis of blockchain for smart system applications, with an extended discussion of the benefits and disadvantages of deploying blockchain based solutions for smart system ecosystems.

本文针对图神经网络（GNN）在节点分类任务中普遍采用的端到端训练方法所引发的对攻击者利用其开放输入输出接口进行边缘扰动攻击的脆弱性问题。文中提出了一种名为“图代理网络”（GAgN）的解决方案。GAgN设计为具有1跳视角的图结构代理网络，通过代理之间的分散交互，它们能够学习获取全局感知以执行包括推断节点嵌入、度量和邻居关系的任务。这一机制使节点能够在执行分类任务的同时过滤掉攻击性的边。此外，代理的有限视野防止了恶意信息在全球范围内传播，从而抵御基于全局优化的次级攻击。文章证明单隐藏层多层感知器（MLP）理论上足以实现上述功能。实验结果表明，GAgN成功实现了其所有预期的功能，并与现有最先进的防御策略相比，在被扰动的数据集上达到了最优的分类准确率。 <div>

Abstract: End-to-end training with global optimization have popularized graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification, yet inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities to adversarial edge-perturbing attacks. Adversaries can exploit the inherent opened interfaces of GNNs' input and output, perturbing critical edges and thus manipulating the classification results. Current defenses, due to their persistent utilization of global-optimization-based end-to-end training schemes, inherently encapsulate the vulnerabilities of GNNs. This is specifically evidenced in their inability to defend against targeted secondary attacks. In this paper, we propose the Graph Agent Network (GAgN) to address the aforementioned vulnerabilities of GNNs. GAgN is a graph-structured agent network in which each node is designed as an 1-hop-view agent. Through the decentralized interactions between agents, they can learn to infer global perceptions to perform tasks including inferring embeddings, degrees and neighbor relationships for given nodes. This empowers nodes to filtering adversarial edges while carrying out classification tasks. Furthermore, agents' limited view prevents malicious messages from propagating globally in GAgN, thereby resisting global-optimization-based secondary attacks. We prove that single-hidden-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are theoretically sufficient to achieve these functionalities. Experimental results show that GAgN effectively implements all its intended capabilities and, compared to state-of-the-art defenses, achieves optimal classification accuracy on the perturbed datasets.

Abstract: With the escalating prevalence of malicious activities exploiting vulnerabilities in blockchain systems, there is an urgent requirement for robust attack detection mechanisms. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel collaborative learning framework designed to detect attacks in blockchain transactions and smart contracts by analyzing transaction features. Our framework exhibits the capability to classify various types of blockchain attacks, including intricate attacks at the machine code level (e.g., injecting malicious codes to withdraw coins from users unlawfully), which typically necessitate significant time and security expertise to detect. To achieve that, the proposed framework incorporates a unique tool that transforms transaction features into visual representations, facilitating efficient analysis and classification of low-level machine codes. Furthermore, we propose an advanced collaborative learning model to enable real-time detection of diverse attack types at distributed mining nodes. Our model can efficiently detect attacks in smart contracts and transactions for blockchain systems without the need to gather all data from mining nodes into a centralized server. In order to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, we deploy a pilot system based on a private Ethereum network and conduct multiple attack scenarios to generate a novel dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our dataset is the most comprehensive and diverse collection of transactions and smart contracts synthesized in a laboratory for cyberattack detection in blockchain systems. Our framework achieves a detection accuracy of approximately 94% through extensive simulations and 91% in real-time experiments with a throughput of over 2,150 transactions per second.

<div> 关键词：Sui Lutris、智能合约平台、次秒级确认、无共识协议、持续运行

总结:

Sui Lutris 是一款智能合约平台，它实现了低于一秒的最终确认时间，这是行业内的首次。它通过在简单支付之外，将无共识协议应用于多种交易中，达到了这一目标。与以往的工作不同，Sui Lutris 在不牺牲表达力和吞吐量的前提下，实现了持续运行而无需重启。其创新之处在于安全地将无共识协议与一个高吞吐量的共识协议结合，后者虽不在关键的最终性路径上运行，但确保了当交易面临不一致的并发访问风险时，其结算会在解决总排序问题后延迟进行。

为了处理重构事件中的系统安全性和长期活动生成潜在错误配置客户端的问题，Sui Lutris 开发了一种新型重构协议，这是首个证明了无共识区块链安全高效重构的协议。此外，Sui Lutris 目前已经在生产环境中运行，支撑着 Sui 智能合约平台。通过使用对象而非账户，它使得智能合约能够安全地执行，将对象作为第一类资源暴露。实验结果显示，Sui Lutris 的延迟低于 0.5 秒，吞吐量可达每秒 5000 证书（以每秒 150,000 操作为基准）。同时，它能够优雅地处理验证器崩溃恢复，且在重构期间不会出现明显的性能下降。 <div>

Abstract: Sui Lutris is the first smart-contract platform to sustainably achieve sub-second finality. It achieves this significant decrease by employing consensusless agreement not only for simple payments but for a large variety of transactions. Unlike prior work, Sui Lutris neither compromises expressiveness nor throughput and can run perpetually without restarts. Sui Lutris achieves this by safely integrating consensuless agreement with a high-throughput consensus protocol that is invoked out of the critical finality path but ensures that when a transaction is at risk of inconsistent concurrent accesses, its settlement is delayed until the total ordering is resolved. Building such a hybrid architecture is especially delicate during reconfiguration events, where the system needs to preserve the safety of the consensusless path without compromising the long-term liveness of potentially misconfigured clients. We thus develop a novel reconfiguration protocol, the first to provably show the safe and efficient reconfiguration of a consensusless blockchain. Sui Lutris is currently running in production and underpins the Sui smart-contract platform. Combined with the use of Objects instead of accounts it enables the safe execution of smart contracts that expose objects as a first-class resource. In our experiments Sui Lutris achieves latency lower than 0.5 seconds for throughput up to 5,000 certificates per second (150k ops/s with transaction blocks), compared to the state-of-the-art real-world consensus latencies of 3 seconds. Furthermore, it gracefully handles validators crash-recovery and does not suffer visible performance degradation during reconfiguration.

Abstract: Exploration in decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning faces two challenges. One is that the novelty of global states is unavailable, while the novelty of local observations is biased. The other is how agents can explore in a coordinated way. To address these challenges, we propose MACE, a simple yet effective multi-agent coordinated exploration method. By communicating only local novelty, agents can take into account other agents' local novelty to approximate the global novelty. Further, we newly introduce weighted mutual information to measure the influence of one agent's action on other agents' accumulated novelty. We convert it as an intrinsic reward in hindsight to encourage agents to exert more influence on other agents' exploration and boost coordinated exploration. Empirically, we show that MACE achieves superior performance in three multi-agent environments with sparse rewards.

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to transform, interpret, and comprehend vast quantities of heterogeneous data presents a significant opportunity to enhance data-driven care delivery. However, the sensitive nature of protected health information (PHI) raises valid concerns about data privacy and trust in remote LLM platforms. In addition, the cost associated with cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) services continues to impede widespread adoption. To address these challenges, we propose a shift in the LLM execution environment from opaque, centralized cloud providers to a decentralized and dynamic fog computing architecture. By executing open-weight LLMs in more trusted environments, such as the user's edge device or a fog layer within a local network, we aim to mitigate the privacy, trust, and financial challenges associated with cloud-based LLMs. We further present SpeziLLM, an open-source framework designed to facilitate rapid and seamless leveraging of different LLM execution layers and lowering barriers to LLM integration in digital health applications. We demonstrate SpeziLLM's broad applicability across six digital health applications, showcasing its versatility in various healthcare settings.

Abstract: The emerging machine learning paradigm of decentralized federated learning (DFL) has the promise of greatly boosting the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) by directly learning across distributed agents without centralized coordination. Despite significant efforts on improving the communication efficiency of DFL, most existing solutions were based on the simplistic assumption that neighboring agents are physically adjacent in the underlying communication network, which fails to correctly capture the communication cost when learning over a general bandwidth-limited network, as encountered in many edge networks. In this work, we address this gap by leveraging recent advances in network tomography to jointly design the communication demands and the communication schedule for overlay-based DFL in bandwidth-limited networks without requiring explicit cooperation from the underlying network. By carefully analyzing the structure of our problem, we decompose it into a series of optimization problems that can each be solved efficiently, to collectively minimize the total training time. Extensive data-driven simulations show that our solution can significantly accelerate DFL in comparison with state-of-the-art designs.

Abstract: In the digital era, where innovative technologies like blockchain are revolutionizing traditional organizational paradigms, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) emerge as avant-garde models of collective governance. However, their unique structure challenges existing legal frameworks, especially concerning the liability of participants. This study focuses on analyzing the legal implications of the decentralized nature of DAOs, with a particular emphasis on the aspects of participant liability. Such considerations are essential for understanding how current legal systems might be adapted or reformed to effectively address these novel challenges.
  The paper examines the specificity of DAOs, highlighting their decentralized governance structure and reliance on smart contracts, which introduce unique issues related to the blurring of liability boundaries. It underscores how the anonymity of DAO participants and the automatic execution of smart contracts complicate the traditional concept of legal liability, both within the DAO context and in interactions with external parties.
  The analysis also includes a comparison between DAOs and traditional organizational forms, such as corporations and associations, to identify potential analogies and differences in participant liability. It explores how existing regulations on partner liability might be insufficient or inapplicable in the DAO context, prompting the search for new, innovative legal solutions.

Abstract: Given the rise in cyber threats to networked systems, coupled with the proliferation of AI techniques and enhanced processing capabilities, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and easily executable. They target system availability, compromising entire systems without breaking underlying security protocols. Consequently, numerous studies have focused on preventing, detecting, and mitigating DoS attacks. However, state-of-the-art systematization efforts have limitations such as isolated DoS countermeasures, shortcomings of AI-based studies, and a lack of DoS integration features like privacy, anonymity, authentication, and transparency. Additionally, the emergence of quantum computers is a game changer for DoS from attack and defense perspectives, yet it has remained largely unexplored. This study aims to address these gaps by examining (counter)-DoS in the AI era while also considering post-quantum (PQ) security when it applies. We highlight the deficiencies in the current literature and provide insights into synergistic techniques to bridge these gaps. We explore AI mechanisms for DoS intrusion detection, evaluate cybersecurity properties in cutting-edge machine learning models, and analyze weaponized AI in the context of DoS. We also investigate collaborative and distributed counter-DoS frameworks via federated learning and blockchains. Finally, we assess proactive approaches such as honeypots, puzzles, and authentication schemes that can be integrated into next-generation network systems for DoS prevention and mitigation.

Abstract: In recent years, LiDAR-based localization and mapping methods have achieved significant progress thanks to their reliable and real-time localization capability. Considering single LiDAR odometry often faces hardware failures and degradation in practical scenarios, Multi-LiDAR Odometry (MLO), as an emerging technology, is studied to enhance the performance of LiDAR-based localization and mapping systems. However, MLO can suffer from high computational complexity introduced by dense point clouds that are fused from multiple LiDARs, and the continuous-time measurement characteristic is constantly neglected by existing LiDAR odometry. This motivates us to develop a Continuous-Time and Efficient MLO, namely CTE-MLO, which can achieve accurate and real-time state estimation using multi-LiDAR measurements through a continuous-time perspective. In this paper, the Gaussian process estimation is naturally combined with the Kalman filter, which enables each LiDAR point in a point stream to query the corresponding continuous-time trajectory within its time instants. A decentralized multi-LiDAR synchronization scheme also be devised to combine points from separate LiDARs into a single point cloud without the requirement for primary LiDAR assignment. Moreover, with the aim of improving the real-time performance of MLO without sacrificing robustness, a point cloud sampling strategy is designed with the consideration of localizability. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through various scenarios, including public datasets and real-world autonomous driving experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed CTE-MLO can achieve high-accuracy continuous-time state estimations in real-time and is demonstratively competitive compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Efficient emergency response systems are crucial for smart cities. But their implementation is highly challenging, particularly in regions like Chad where infrastructural constraints are prevalent. The urgency for optimized response times and resource allocation in emergency scenarios is magnified in these contexts, yet existing solutions often assume robust infrastructure and uninterrupted connectivity, which is not always available. Most of the time, they are based on system architectures pre-designed for other purposes. This paper addresses these critical challenges by proposing a comprehensive system architecture that integrates Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Dijkstra's algorithm, and Edge Computing. The objective is to enhance emergency response through accelerated route planning and resource allocation, addressing gaps left by traditional cloud-based systems. Methodologically, key characteristics of the desired system are identified, then its components are described and their integration is explained; the system leverages FPGA-based computations and a distributed implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest paths rapidly, while Edge Computing ensures decentralized and resilient processing. A theoretical analysis highlights promising improvements in response times and resource management. The proposed system architecture not only enhances emergency response efficiency but is also adaptable to infrastructural constraints of Chadian-like environments.

Abstract: Ethereum has officially provided a set of system-level cryptographic APIs to enhance smart contracts with cryptographic capabilities. These APIs have been utilized in over 10% of Ethereum transactions, motivating developers to implement various on-chain cryptographic tasks, such as digital signatures. However, since developers may not always be cryptographic experts, their ad-hoc and potentially defective implementations could compromise the theoretical guarantees of cryptography, leading to real-world security issues. To mitigate this threat, we conducted the first study aimed at demystifying and detecting cryptographic defects in smart contracts. Through the analysis of 2,406 real-world security reports, we defined nine types of cryptographic defects in smart contracts with detailed descriptions and practical detection patterns. Based on this categorization, we proposed CrySol, a fuzzing-based tool to automate the detection of cryptographic defects in smart contracts. It combines transaction replaying and dynamic taint analysis to extract fine-grained crypto-related semantics and employs crypto-specific strategies to guide the test case generation process. Furthermore, we collected a large-scale dataset containing 25,745 real-world crypto-related smart contracts and evaluated CrySol's effectiveness on it. The result demonstrated that CrySol achieves an overall precision of 95.4% and a recall of 91.2%. Notably, CrySol revealed that 5,847 (22.7%) out of 25,745 smart contracts contain at least one cryptographic defect, highlighting the prevalence of these defects.

总结:
本文提出了一种名为CRAMP的新颖方法，这是一种基于图神经网络（GNNs）的、考虑人群的分散式强化学习策略，旨在解决拥挤环境中多代理路径规划（MAPF）问题。CRAMP通过促进代理之间的高效局部通信，增强其对复杂环境的适应性，从而提高决策能力。与当前最先进的分散式MAPF方法相比，CRAMP在多个指标上表现出色：在模拟环境中，它在完成时间（makespan）和碰撞计数方面提高了59%，在成功率方面提高了35%。

CRAMP的关键特性在于其利用GNNs来实现高效的局部通信，这使得代理能够获取周围环境的即时信息，进而做出更明智的决策，以避免碰撞并优化路径。这种方法不仅克服了集中式规划中随代理数量增加而加剧的维数灾难问题，也弥补了分散式规划在密集环境中收敛速度慢和性能下降的问题。通过实验验证，CRAMP证明了其在处理复杂、拥挤场景时的有效性和优越性，为多代理系统在实际应用中的路径规划提供了有力的支持。 <div>

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) in crowded environments presents a challenging problem in motion planning, aiming to find collision-free paths for all agents in the system. MAPF finds a wide range of applications in various domains, including aerial swarms, autonomous warehouse robotics, and self-driving vehicles. Current approaches to MAPF generally fall into two main categories: centralized and decentralized planning. Centralized planning suffers from the curse of dimensionality when the number of agents or states increases and thus does not scale well in large and complex environments. On the other hand, decentralized planning enables agents to engage in real-time path planning within a partially observable environment, demonstrating implicit coordination. However, they suffer from slow convergence and performance degradation in dense environments. In this paper, we introduce CRAMP, a novel crowd-aware decentralized reinforcement learning approach to address this problem by enabling efficient local communication among agents via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), facilitating situational awareness and decision-making capabilities in congested environments. We test CRAMP on simulated environments and demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art decentralized methods for MAPF on various metrics. CRAMP improves the solution quality up to 59% measured in makespan and collision count, and up to 35% improvement in success rate in comparison to previous methods.

文章提出了一种名为JANUS的开放性和鲁棒性更强的远程验证（RA）方案，以解决现有可信执行环境（TEE）RA设计中集中式信任模型的脆弱性和固定流程的局限性。JANUS通过引入物理不可克隆功能（PUF）作为TEE中的内在根信任（RoT），提供直接的物理可信度量，从而分散了信任。同时，设计了基于智能合约的去中心化验证功能，包括结果审计和RA会话快照，增强了系统的透明性和可追溯性。此外，JANUS还设计了一个自动切换机制，允许系统在不同情况下保持鲁棒性并提供灵活的RA服务。

JANUS的创新之处在于其去中心化的信任模型、利用PUF增强TEE的安全性、智能合约的引入以实现验证过程的自动化和透明性，以及自动化切换机制以适应不断变化的安全需求。文章还提供了基于UC的安全性证明，展示了JANUS在实施原型中的可扩展性和通用性，证明了该方案在实际应用中的潜力和优势。 <div>

Abstract: Remote Attestation (RA) enables the integrity and authenticity of applications in Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to be verified. Existing TEE RA designs employ a centralized trust model where they rely on a single provisioned secret key and a centralized verifier to establish trust for remote parties. This model is however brittle and can be untrusted under advanced attacks nowadays. Besides, most designs only have fixed procedures once deployed, making them hard to adapt to different emerging situations and provide resilient functionalities.
  Therefore, we propose JANUS, an open and resilient TEE RA scheme. To decentralize trust, we, on one hand, introduce Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) as an intrinsic root of trust (RoT) in TEE to directly provide physical trusted measurements. On the other hand, we design novel decentralized verification functions on smart contract with result audits and RA session snapshot. Furthermore, we design an automated switch mechanism that allows JANUS to remain resilient and offer flexible RA services under various situations. We provide a UC-based security proof and demonstrate the scalability and generality of JANUS by implementing an complete prototype.

Abstract: To enhance straggler resilience in federated learning (FL) systems, a semi-decentralized approach has been recently proposed, enabling collaboration between clients. Unlike the existing semi-decentralized schemes, which adaptively adjust the collaboration weight according to the network topology, this letter proposes a deterministic coded network that leverages wireless diversity for semi-decentralized FL without requiring prior information about the entire network. Furthermore, the theoretical analyses of the outage and the convergence rate of the proposed scheme are provided. Finally, the superiority of our proposed method over benchmark methods is demonstrated through comprehensive simulations.

Abstract: Credit assignment is a core problem that distinguishes agents' marginal contributions for optimizing cooperative strategies in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Current credit assignment methods usually assume synchronous decision-making among agents. However, a prerequisite for many realistic cooperative tasks is asynchronous decision-making by agents, without waiting for others to avoid disastrous consequences. To address this issue, we propose an asynchronous credit assignment framework with a problem model called ADEX-POMDP and a multiplicative value decomposition (MVD) algorithm. ADEX-POMDP is an asynchronous problem model with extra virtual agents for a decentralized partially observable markov decision process. We prove that ADEX-POMDP preserves both the task equilibrium and the algorithm convergence. MVD utilizes multiplicative interaction to efficiently capture the interactions of asynchronous decisions, and we theoretically demonstrate its advantages in handling asynchronous tasks. Experimental results show that on two asynchronous decision-making benchmarks, Overcooked and POAC, MVD not only consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MARL methods but also provides the interpretability for asynchronous cooperation.

Abstract: The metaverse, envisioned as the next digital frontier for avatar-based virtual interaction, involves high-performance models. In this dynamic environment, users' tasks frequently shift, requiring fast model personalization despite limited data. This evolution consumes extensive resources and requires vast data volumes. To address this, meta-learning emerges as an invaluable tool for metaverse users, with federated meta-learning (FML), offering even more tailored solutions owing to its adaptive capabilities. However, the metaverse is characterized by users heterogeneity with diverse data structures, varied tasks, and uneven sample sizes, potentially undermining global training outcomes due to statistical difference. Given this, an urgent need arises for smart coalition formation that accounts for these disparities. This paper introduces a dual game-theoretic framework for metaverse services involving meta-learners as workers to manage FML. A blockchain-based cooperative coalition formation game is crafted, grounded on a reputation metric, user similarity, and incentives. We also introduce a novel reputation system based on users' historical contributions and potential contributions to present tasks, leveraging correlations between past and new tasks. Finally, a Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism is presented to attract reliable workers to participate in meta-learning, minimizing users' energy costs, increasing payoffs, boosting FML efficacy, and improving metaverse utility. Results show that our dual game framework outperforms best-effort, random, and non-uniform clustering schemes - improving training performance by up to 10%, cutting completion times by as much as 30%, enhancing metaverse utility by more than 25%, and offering up to 5% boost in training efficiency over non-blockchain systems, effectively countering misbehaving users.

Abstract: The ability of a peer-to-peer (P2P) system to effectively host decentralized applications often relies on the availability of a peer-sampling service, which provides each participant with a random sample of other peers. Despite the practical effectiveness of existing peer samplers, their ability to produce random samples within a reasonable time frame remains poorly understood from a theoretical standpoint. This paper contributes to bridging this gap by introducing PeerSwap, a peer-sampling protocol with provable randomness guarantees. We establish execution time bounds for PeerSwap, demonstrating its ability to scale effectively with the network size. We prove that PeerSwap maintains the fixed structure of the communication graph while allowing sequential peer position swaps within this graph. We do so by showing that PeerSwap is a specific instance of an interchange process, a renowned model for particle movement analysis. Leveraging this mapping, we derive execution time bounds, expressed as a function of the network size N. Depending on the network structure, this time can be as low as a polylogarithmic function of N, highlighting the efficiency of PeerSwap. We implement PeerSwap and conduct numerical evaluations using regular graphs with varying connectivity and containing up to 32768 (2^15) peers. Our evaluation demonstrates that PeerSwap quickly provides peers with uniform random samples of other peers.

Abstract: The computational study of equilibria involving constraints on players' strategies has been largely neglected. However, in real-world applications, players are usually subject to constraints ruling out the feasibility of some of their strategies, such as, e.g., safety requirements and budget caps. Computational studies on constrained versions of the Nash equilibrium have lead to some results under very stringent assumptions, while finding constrained versions of the correlated equilibrium (CE) is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce and computationally characterize constrained Phi-equilibria -- a more general notion than constrained CEs -- in normal-form games. We show that computing such equilibria is in general computationally intractable, and also that the set of the equilibria may not be convex, providing a sharp divide with unconstrained CEs. Nevertheless, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a constrained (approximate) Phi-equilibrium maximizing a given linear function, when either the number of constraints or that of players' actions is fixed. Moreover, in the special case in which a player's constraints do not depend on other players' strategies, we show that an exact, function-maximizing equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time, while one (approximate) equilibrium can be found with an efficient decentralized no-regret learning algorithm.

Abstract: Data mesh is an emerging domain-driven decentralized data architecture that aims to minimize or avoid operational bottlenecks associated with centralized, monolithic data architectures in enterprises. The topic has picked the practitioners' interest, and there is considerable gray literature on it. At the same time, we observe a lack of academic attempts at defining and building upon the concept. Hence, in this article, we aim to start from the foundations and characterize the data mesh architecture regarding its design principles, architectural components, capabilities, and organizational roles. We systematically collected, analyzed, and synthesized 114 industrial gray literature articles. The review provides insights into practitioners' perspectives on the four key principles of data mesh: data as a product, domain ownership of data, self-serve data platform, and federated computational governance. Moreover, due to the comparability of data mesh and SOA (service-oriented architecture), we mapped the findings from the gray literature into the reference architectures from the SOA academic literature to create the reference architectures for describing three key dimensions of data mesh: organization of capabilities and roles, development, and runtime. Finally, we discuss open research issues in data mesh, partially based on the findings from the gray literature.

总结:
本文研究了在医疗数据分析中如何处理来自不同医疗机构的数据，这些数据可能因地理位置或设施差异而产生偏倚，违反了独立同分布（i.i.d.）原则。针对这一问题，作者提出了一种名为“分布式集群谐波化”的新方法，通过利用不同机构间数据的聚类模式来提高ComBat算法的兼容性和实用性。

首先，ComBat算法是一种流行的谐波化方法，用于校正来自不同地点的数据偏倚。然而，当需要处理新加入的机构或未知机构的数据时，传统的ComBat算法需要重新训练，这带来了巨大的计算和物流负担。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了“分布式集群谐波化”算法，该算法在保持ComBat算法优势的同时，提高了对新数据的适应性。

接着，通过广泛的模拟实验和ADNI（阿尔茨海默病神经影像学倡议）的真实医疗影像数据，证明了新方法的有效性。实验结果表明，与传统ComBat算法相比，分布式集群谐波化在保持数据一致性的同时，显著提高了处理新数据的能力，从而减少了重训的必要性。

最后，为了方便研究者和实践者使用，作者提供了实现该算法的代码库，以促进其在实际应用中的推广和应用。

总的来说，本文提出的分布式集群谐波化算法为处理医疗领域中来自不同机构的数据提供了一种有效且高效的方法，不仅解决了数据偏倚问题，还降低了计算和物流成本，具有重要的理论价值和实际应用前景。 <div>

Abstract: Independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data is essential to many data analysis and modeling techniques. In the medical domain, collecting data from multiple sites or institutions is a common strategy that guarantees sufficient clinical diversity, determined by the decentralized nature of medical data. However, data from various sites are easily biased by the local environment or facilities, thereby violating the i.i.d. rule. A common strategy is to harmonize the site bias while retaining important biological information. The ComBat is among the most popular harmonization approaches and has recently been extended to handle distributed sites. However, when faced with situations involving newly joined sites in training or evaluating data from unknown/unseen sites, ComBat lacks compatibility and requires retraining with data from all the sites. The retraining leads to significant computational and logistic overhead that is usually prohibitive. In this work, we develop a novel Cluster ComBat harmonization algorithm, which leverages cluster patterns of the data in different sites and greatly advances the usability of ComBat harmonization. We use extensive simulation and real medical imaging data from ADNI to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. Our codes are provided in https://github.com/illidanlab/distributed-cluster-harmonization.

Abstract: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are blockchain-based organizations that facilitate decentralized governance. Today, DAOs not only hold billions of dollars in their treasury but also govern many of the most popular Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. This paper systematically analyses security threats to DAOs, focusing on the types of attacks they face. We study attacks on DAOs that took place in the past, attacks that have been theorized to be possible, and potential attacks that were uncovered and prevented in audits. For each of these (potential) attacks, we describe and categorize the attack vectors utilized into four categories. This reveals that while many attacks on DAOs take advantage of the less tangible and more complex human nature involved in governance, audits tend to focus on code and protocol vulnerabilities. Thus, additionally, the paper examines empirical data on DAO vulnerabilities, outlines risk factors contributing to these attacks, and suggests mitigation strategies to safeguard against such vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Federated learning has become an emerging technology for data analysis for IoT applications. This paper implements centralized and decentralized federated learning frameworks for crop yield prediction based on Long Short-Term Memory Network. For centralized federated learning, multiple clients and one server is considered, where the clients exchange their model updates with the server that works as the aggregator to build the global model. For the decentralized framework, a collaborative network is formed among the devices either using ring topology or using mesh topology. In this network, each device receives model updates from the neighbour devices, and performs aggregation to build the upgraded model. The performance of the centralized and decentralized federated learning frameworks are evaluated in terms of prediction accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and training time. The experimental results present that $\geq$97% and $>$97.5% prediction accuracy are achieved using the centralized and decentralized federated learning-based frameworks respectively. The results also show that the using centralized federated learning the response time can be reduced by $\sim$75% than the cloud-only framework. Finally, the future research directions of the use of federated learning in crop yield prediction are explored in this paper.

Abstract: The Multi-agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem involves finding collision-free paths for a team of agents in a known, static environment, with important applications in warehouse automation, logistics, or last-mile delivery. To meet the needs of these large-scale applications, current learning-based methods often deploy the same fully trained, decentralized network to all agents to improve scalability. However, such parameter sharing typically results in homogeneous behaviors among agents, which may prevent agents from breaking ties around symmetric conflict (e.g., bottlenecks) and might lead to live-/deadlocks. In this paper, we propose SYLPH, a novel learning-based MAPF framework aimed to mitigate the adverse effects of homogeneity by allowing agents to learn and dynamically select different social behaviors (akin to individual, dynamic roles), without affecting the scalability offered by parameter sharing. Specifically, SYLPH agents learn to select their Social Value Orientation (SVO) given the situation at hand, quantifying their own level of selfishness/altruism, as well as an SVO-conditioned MAPF policy dictating their movement actions. To these ends, each agent first determines the most influential other agent in the system by predicting future conflicts/interactions with other agents. Each agent selects its own SVO towards that agent, and trains its decentralized MAPF policy to enact this SVO until another agent becomes more influential. To further allow agents to consider each others' social preferences, each agent gets access to the SVO value of their neighbors. As a result of this hierarchical decision-making and exchange of social preferences, SYLPH endows agents with the ability to reason about the MAPF task through more latent spaces and nuanced contexts, leading to varied responses that can help break ties around symmetric conflicts.

总结:

这篇论文探讨了Bluesky，一个类似Twitter的去中心化社交媒体平台，在其向全球公众开放后的两个月内的用户活动情况。研究发现，平台用户活跃度分布广泛，与成熟平台相似，但原创内容比例较高，转发内容较少。此外，Bluesky的毒性内容水平极低，显示了良好的社区氛围。

在平台对外开放后，用户基数和活动量迅速增长，特别是英语和日语内容的发布。然而，一些新账号通过大量关注和分享低信誉新闻媒体的内容，引发了异常行为，显示出潜在的垃圾信息传播风险。部分账号已被识别为垃圾邮件或被暂停，这表明平台在实施有效的内容管理和用户行为监管方面表现出色。

Abstract: Bluesky is a Twitter-like decentralized social media platform that has recently grown in popularity. After an invite-only period, it opened to the public worldwide on February 6th, 2024. In this paper, we provide a longitudinal analysis of user activity in the two months around the opening, studying changes in the general characteristics of the platform due to the rapid growth of the user base. We observe a broad distribution of activity similar to more established platforms, but a higher volume of original than reshared content, and very low toxicity. After opening to the public, Bluesky experienced a large surge in new users and activity, especially posting English and Japanese content. In particular, several accounts entered the discussion with suspicious behavior, like following many accounts and sharing content from low-credibility news outlets. Some of these have already been classified as spam or suspended, suggesting effective moderation.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have achieved tremendous success in modeling complex graph data in a variety of applications. However, there are limited studies investigating privacy protection in GNNs. In this work, we propose a learning framework that can provide node privacy at the user level, while incurring low utility loss. We focus on a decentralized notion of Differential Privacy, namely Local Differential Privacy, and apply randomization mechanisms to perturb both feature and label data at the node level before the data is collected by a central server for model training. Specifically, we investigate the application of randomization mechanisms in high-dimensional feature settings and propose an LDP protocol with strict privacy guarantees. Based on frequency estimation in statistical analysis of randomized data, we develop reconstruction methods to approximate features and labels from perturbed data. We also formulate this learning framework to utilize frequency estimates of graph clusters to supervise the training procedure at a sub-graph level. Extensive experiments on real-world and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the validity of our proposed model.

<div> 关键词：区块链、经济激励、延迟减少、EDoS攻击、成本效益分析

文章主要探讨了与区块链中的可提取价值（MEV/BEV）策略相关的经济激励如何促使网络节点减少延迟，特别是最小化交易验证时间。文章引入了一种修改后的节点模型，该节点忽视了过滤无效交易的过程，从而为区块链网络引入了新的攻击途径。文章详细描述了一个名为Blockchain Economic Denial of Sustainability（EDoS）的攻击模型，这种攻击能够导致操作修改节点的流量成本损失。研究通过数学定义、实证实例识别、参数测量和本地网络攻击模拟等步骤，展示了这种攻击能够显著增加网络流量，并造成巨大的经济损失。

文章指出，尽管存在经济风险，但减少验证过程的延迟仍然可能带来足够的利润，以支持修改节点的存在。为了评估这一权衡，文章模拟了交易验证过程并实测了部署修改节点后产生的延迟减少。最终，文章提出了针对这种攻击的缓解策略，并进行了成本效益分析。

总结:
文章深入探讨了区块链网络中，特别是以太坊P2P网络中，由MEV/BEV策略驱动的延迟减少带来的新安全挑战——EDoS攻击。通过实证研究和模拟实验，揭示了攻击者如何利用修改节点进行流量放大攻击，以及这种攻击对网络经济造成的严重威胁。文章不仅指出了减少验证延迟可能导致的安全风险，还通过成本效益分析强调了理解这种风险与潜在收益之间的平衡至关重要。为此，文章提供了对抗此类攻击的策略建议，旨在为区块链网络的安全性和稳定性提供指导。 <div>

Abstract: Strategies related to the blockchain concept of Extractable Value (MEV/BEV), such as arbitrage, front- or back-running create an economic incentive for network nodes to reduce latency, including minimizing transaction validation time -- a core feature to secure blockchain networks. A modified node, that neglects to filter invalid transactions in the Ethereum P2P network, introduces novel attack vectors. In this work, we formalize and evaluate a Blockchain Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attack, which can cause financial losses in traffic costs for operators of modified nodes. We 1) mathematically define the attack model, 2) identify thousands of empirical instances of this similar attack in the wild, 3) empirically measure the model parameters from our two monitoring nodes, and 4) conduct attack simulations on the local network to compare its performance with existing Denial-of-Service attacks. We show that an attacker can amplify network traffic at modified nodes by a factor of 3,600, and cause economic damages 13,800 times greater than the amount needed to carry out the attack. Despite these risks, aggressive latency reduction may still be profitable enough to justify the existence of modified nodes. To assess this trade-off, we 1) simulate the transaction validation process in the local network and 2) empirically measure the latency reduction by deploying our modified node in the Ethereum testnet. We conclude with a cost-benefit analysis of skipping validation and provide mitigation strategies against this attack.

<div> 关键词：远程质押、经济安全、协议违规、智能合约、Cosmos SDK

总结:
本文提出了一种新型远程质押协议，旨在增强基于Cosmos SDK并运行Tendermint共识算法的消费者链的经济安全性。该协议的核心创新在于确保了在消费者链发生安全违规时，提供链至少有三分之一的质押资产会被削减。这一目标的实现依赖于两个关键贡献：首先，设计了一个远程解绑协议，当消费者链出现安全问题时，能够确保在提供链上解绑质押前执行削减操作；其次，即使提供链不支持智能合约，也能实现对质押资产的削减。

通过结合这些机制，该协议不仅为使用非本地代币进行远程质押的区块链网络提供了更强的安全保障，而且有效利用了不同区块链之间的资源，提高了整个生态系统抵御风险的能力。特别地，文章以比特币作为提供链的示例，展示了如何在实际应用中实施这种远程质押方案，从而进一步验证了其理论可行性与实用性。 <div>

Abstract: Proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains require validators to lock their tokens as collateral, slashing these tokens if they are identified as protocol violators. PoS chains have mostly been secured by their native tokens. However, using only the native token upper-bounds the value eligible for staking by the market capitalization of the native token. In contrast, the remote staking of another crypto asset from a provider chain provides an avenue to improve the consumer chain's economic security. In this paper, we present the first known remote staking protocols with guaranteed optimal economic safety: whenever there is a safety violation on the consumer chain, at least one third of the provider's stake securing the consumer chain is slashed. To achieve this goal for a broad range of provider and consumer chains, two independent contributions are made: 1) a remote unbonding protocol that ensures slashing before the stake is unbonded on the provider chain if there is safety violation on the consumer chain; 2) a protocol to slash stake even without smart contracts on the provider chain. The remote staking protocol is analyzed and implemented in the case where the provider chain is Bitcoin and the consumer chain is a Cosmos SDK chain running the Tendermint consensus protocol.

Abstract: Effective routing in satellite mega-constellations has become crucial to facilitate the handling of increasing traffic loads, more complex network architectures, as well as the integration into 6G networks. To enhance adaptability as well as robustness to unpredictable traffic demands, and to solve dynamic routing environments efficiently, machine learning-based solutions are being considered. For network control problems, such as optimizing packet forwarding decisions according to Quality of Service requirements and maintaining network stability, deep reinforcement learning techniques have demonstrated promising results. For this reason, we investigate the viability of multi-agent deep Q-networks for routing in satellite constellation networks. We focus specifically on reward shaping and quantifying training convergence for joint optimization of latency and load balancing in static and dynamic scenarios. To address identified drawbacks, we propose a novel hybrid solution based on centralized learning and decentralized control.

Abstract: Dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) between satellite and terrestrial networks has increasingly engaged the academic and industrial sectors. Nevertheless, facilitating secure, efficient and scalable sharing continues to pose a pivotal challenge. Emerging as a promising technology to bridge the trust gap among multiple participants, blockchain has been envisioned to enable DSS in a decentralized manner. However, satellites with limited resources may struggle to support the frequent interactions required by blockchain networks. Additionally,given the extensive coverage of satellites, spectrum sharing needs vary by regions, challenging traditional blockchain approaches to accommodate differences. In this work, a partitioned, self-governed, and customized dynamic spectrum sharing approach (PSC-DSS) is proposed for spectrum sharing between satellite access networks and terrestrial access networks. This approach establishes a sharded and tiered architecture which allows various regions to manage spectrum autonomously while jointly maintaining a single blockchain ledger. Moreover, a spectrum-consensus integrated mechanism, which decouples DSS process and couples it with blockchain consensus protocol, is designed to enable regions to conduct DSS transactions in parallel and dynamically innovate spectrum sharing schemes without affecting others. Furthermore, a theoretical framework is derived to justify the stability performance of PSC-DSS. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the advantageous performance of PSC-DSS in terms of low-overhead, high efficiency, and robust stability.
