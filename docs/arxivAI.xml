Abstract: An ensemble of trained multimodal encoders and vision-language models (VLMs) has become a standard approach for visual question answering (VQA) tasks. However, such models often fail to produce responses with the detailed precision necessary for complex, domain-specific applications such as medical VQA. Our representation model, BIND: BLIVA Integrated with Dense Encoding, extends prior multimodal work by refining the joint embedding space through dense, query-token-based encodings inspired by contrastive pretraining techniques. This refined encoder powers Med-GRIM, a model designed for medical VQA tasks that leverages graph-based retrieval and prompt engineering to integrate domain-specific knowledge. Rather than relying on compute-heavy fine-tuning of vision and language models on specific datasets, Med-GRIM applies a low-compute, modular workflow with small language models (SLMs) for efficiency. Med-GRIM employs prompt-based retrieval to dynamically inject relevant knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and robustness in its responses. By assigning distinct roles to each agent within the VQA system, Med-GRIM achieves large language model performance at a fraction of the computational cost. Additionally, to support scalable research in zero-shot multimodal medical applications, we introduce DermaGraph, a novel Graph-RAG dataset comprising diverse dermatological conditions. This dataset facilitates both multimodal and unimodal querying. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/Rakesh-123-cryp/Med-GRIM.git

Abstract: Inspection of aquaculture net pens is essential for ensuring the structural integrity and sustainable operation of offshore fish farming systems. Traditional methods, typically based on manually operated or single-ROV systems, offer limited adaptability to real-time constraints such as energy consumption, hardware faults, and dynamic underwater conditions. This paper introduces AquaChat++, a novel multi-ROV inspection framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable adaptive mission planning, coordinated task execution, and fault-tolerant control in complex aquaculture environments. The proposed system consists of a two-layered architecture. The high-level plan generation layer employs an LLM, such as ChatGPT-4, to translate natural language user commands into symbolic, multi-agent inspection plans. A task manager dynamically allocates and schedules actions among ROVs based on their real-time status and operational constraints, including thruster faults and battery levels. The low-level control layer ensures accurate trajectory tracking and integrates thruster fault detection and compensation mechanisms. By incorporating real-time feedback and event-triggered replanning, AquaChat++ enhances system robustness and operational efficiency. Simulated experiments in a physics-based aquaculture environment demonstrate improved inspection coverage, energy-efficient behavior, and resilience to actuator failures. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven frameworks to support scalable, intelligent, and autonomous underwater robotic operations within the aquaculture sector.

Abstract: The advancement of intelligent agents has revolutionized problem-solving across diverse domains, yet solutions for personalized fashion styling remain underexplored, which holds immense promise for promoting shopping experiences. In this work, we present StyleTailor, the first collaborative agent framework that seamlessly unifies personalized apparel design, shopping recommendation, virtual try-on, and systematic evaluation into a cohesive workflow. To this end, StyleTailor pioneers an iterative visual refinement paradigm driven by multi-level negative feedback, enabling adaptive and precise user alignment. Specifically, our framework features two core agents, i.e., Designer for personalized garment selection and Consultant for virtual try-on, whose outputs are progressively refined via hierarchical vision-language model feedback spanning individual items, complete outfits, and try-on efficacy. Counterexamples are aggregated into negative prompts, forming a closed-loop mechanism that enhances recommendation quality.To assess the performance, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite encompassing style consistency, visual quality, face similarity, and artistic appraisal. Extensive experiments demonstrate StyleTailor's superior performance in delivering personalized designs and recommendations, outperforming strong baselines without negative feedback and establishing a new benchmark for intelligent fashion systems.

<title>Operationalizing Serendipity: Multi-Agent AI Workflows for Enhanced Materials Characterization with Theory-in-the-Loop</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06569</link>

Abstract: The history of science is punctuated by serendipitous discoveries, where unexpected observations, rather than targeted hypotheses, opened new fields of inquiry. While modern autonomous laboratories excel at accelerating hypothesis testing, their optimization for efficiency risks overlooking these crucial, unplanned findings. To address this gap, we introduce SciLink, an open-source, multi-agent artificial intelligence framework designed to operationalize serendipity in materials research by creating a direct, automated link between experimental observation, novelty assessment, and theoretical simulations. The framework employs a hybrid AI strategy where specialized machine learning models perform quantitative analysis of experimental data, while large language models handle higher-level reasoning. These agents autonomously convert raw data from materials characterization techniques into falsifiable scientific claims, which are then quantitatively scored for novelty against the published literature. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across diverse research scenarios, showcasing its application to atomic-resolution and hyperspectral data, its capacity to integrate real-time human expert guidance, and its ability to close the research loop by proposing targeted follow-up experiments. By systematically analyzing all observations and contextualizing them, SciLink provides a practical framework for AI-driven materials research that not only enhances efficiency but also actively cultivates an environment ripe for serendipitous discoveries, thereby bridging the gap between automated experimentation and open-ended scientific exploration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials. We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model (BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query, surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs, and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive real-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.

<title>BrowseComp-Plus: A More Fair and Transparent Evaluation Benchmark of Deep-Research Agent</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06600</link>

Abstract: Deep-Research agents, which integrate large language models (LLMs) with search tools, have shown success in improving the effectiveness of handling complex queries that require iterative search planning and reasoning over search results. Evaluations on current benchmarks like BrowseComp relies on black-box live web search APIs, have notable limitations in (1) fairness: dynamic and opaque web APIs hinder fair comparisons and reproducibility of deep research methods; (2) transparency: lack of control over the document corpus makes it difficult to isolate retriever contributions. In other words, the current evaluations may compare a complete deep research system at a given time, but they do not foster well-controlled experiments to provide insights into the capability of underlying deep research LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce BrowseComp-Plus, a benchmark derived from BrowseComp, employing a fixed, carefully curated corpus. Each query in BrowseComp-Plus includes human-verified supporting documents and mined challenging negatives, enabling controlled experimentation. The benchmark is shown to be effective in distinguishing the performance of deep research systems. For instance, the open-source model Search-R1, when paired with the BM25 retriever, achieves 3.86% accuracy, whereas the GPT-5 achieves 55.9%. Integrating the GPT-5 with the Qwen3-Embedding-8B retriever further enhances its accuracy to 70.1% with fewer search calls. This benchmark allows comprehensive evaluation and disentangled analysis of deep research agents and retrieval methods, fostering insights into retrieval effectiveness, citation accuracy, and context engineering in Deep-Research system.

<title>In-Context Reinforcement Learning via Communicative World Models</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle to generalize to new tasks and contexts without updating their parameters, mainly because their learned representations and policies are overfit to the specifics of their training environments. To boost agents' in-context RL (ICRL) ability, this work formulates ICRL as a two-agent emergent communication problem and introduces CORAL (Communicative Representation for Adaptive RL), a framework that learns a transferable communicative context by decoupling latent representation learning from control. In CORAL, an Information Agent (IA) is pre-trained as a world model on a diverse distribution of tasks. Its objective is not to maximize task reward, but to build a world model and distill its understanding into concise messages. The emergent communication protocol is shaped by a novel Causal Influence Loss, which measures the effect that the message has on the next action. During deployment, the previously trained IA serves as a fixed contextualizer for a new Control Agent (CA), which learns to solve tasks by interpreting the provided communicative context. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach enables the CA to achieve significant gains in sample efficiency and successfully perform zero-shot adaptation with the help of pre-trained IA in entirely unseen sparse-reward environments, validating the efficacy of learning a transferable communicative representation.

<title>Emergence of Cooperation and Commitment in Optional Prisoner's Dilemma</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06702</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Commitment is a well-established mechanism for fostering cooperation in human society and multi-agent systems. However, existing research has predominantly focused on the commitment that neglects the freedom of players to abstain from an interaction, limiting their applicability to many real-world scenarios where participation is often voluntary. In this paper, we present a two-stage game model to investigate the evolution of commitment-based behaviours and cooperation within the framework of the optional Prisoner's Dilemma game. In the pre-game stage, players decide whether to accept a mutual commitment. Once in the game, they choose among cooperation, defection, or exiting, depending on the formation of a pre-game commitment. We find that optional participation boosts commitment acceptance but fails to foster cooperation, leading instead to widespread exit behaviour. To address this, we then introduce and compare two institutional incentive approaches: i) a strict one (STRICT-COM) that rewards only committed players who cooperate in the game, and ii) a flexible one (FLEXIBLE-COM) that rewards any committed players who do not defect in the game. The results reveal that, while the strict approach is demonstrably better for promoting cooperation as the flexible rule creates a loophole for an opportunistic exit after committing, the flexible rule offers an efficient alternative for enhancing social welfare when such opportunistic behaviour results in a high gain. This study highlights the limitations of relying solely on voluntary participation and commitment to resolving social dilemmas, emphasising the importance of well-designed institutional incentives to promote cooperation and social welfare effectively.

<title>Improved Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Robots with ORCA-FLC</title>

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance enables autonomous agents and robots to operate safely and efficiently in dynamic and complex environments, reducing the risk of collisions and damage. For a robot or autonomous system to successfully navigate through obstacles, it must be able to detect such obstacles. While numerous collision avoidance algorithms like the dynamic window approach (DWA), timed elastic bands (TEB), and reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVO) have been proposed, they may lead to suboptimal paths due to fixed weights, be computationally expensive, or have limited adaptability to dynamic obstacles in multi-agent environments. Optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA), which improves on RVO, provides smoother trajectories and stronger collision avoidance guarantees. We propose ORCA-FL to improve on ORCA by using fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) to better handle uncertainty and imprecision for obstacle avoidance in path planning. Numerous multi-agent experiments are conducted and it is shown that ORCA-FL can outperform ORCA in reducing the number of collision if the agent has a velocity that exceeds a certain threshold. In addition, a proposed algorithm for improving ORCA-FL using fuzzy Q reinforcement learning (FQL) is detailed for optimizing and tuning FLCs.

<title>Understanding Privacy Norms Around LLM-Based Chatbots: A Contextual Integrity Perspective</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06760</link>

Abstract: LLM-driven chatbots like ChatGPT have created large volumes of conversational data, but little is known about how user privacy expectations are evolving with this technology. We conduct a survey experiment with 300 US ChatGPT users to understand emerging privacy norms for sharing chatbot data. Our findings reveal a stark disconnect between user concerns and behavior: 82% of respondents rated chatbot conversations as sensitive or highly sensitive - more than email or social media posts - but nearly half reported discussing health topics and over one-third discussed personal finances with ChatGPT. Participants expressed strong privacy concerns (t(299) = 8.5, p < .01) and doubted their conversations would remain private (t(299) = -6.9, p < .01). Despite this, respondents uniformly rejected sharing personal data (search history, emails, device access) for improved services, even in exchange for premium features worth $200. To identify which factors influence appropriate chatbot data sharing, we presented participants with factorial vignettes manipulating seven contextual factors. Linear mixed models revealed that only the transmission factors such as informed consent, data anonymization, or the removal of personally identifiable information, significantly affected perceptions of appropriateness and concern for data access. Surprisingly, contextual factors including the recipient of the data (hospital vs. tech company), purpose (research vs. advertising), type of content, and geographic location did not show significant effects. Our results suggest that users apply consistent baseline privacy expectations to chatbot data, prioritizing procedural safeguards over recipient trustworthiness. This has important implications for emerging agentic AI systems that assume user willingness to integrate personal data across platforms.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) are transforming industries through advanced data processing and analysis, positioning the world of DTs, Digital World, as a cornerstone of nextgeneration technologies including embodied AI. As robotics and automated systems scale, efficient data-sharing frameworks and robust algorithms become critical. We explore the pivotal role of data handling in next-gen networks, focusing on dynamics between application and network providers (AP/NP) in DT ecosystems. We introduce PANAMA, a novel algorithm with Priority Asymmetry for Network Aware Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based multi-agent path finding (MAPF). By adopting a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework and asynchronous actor-learner architectures, PANAMA accelerates training while enabling autonomous task execution by embodied AI. Our approach demonstrates superior pathfinding performance in accuracy, speed, and scalability compared to existing benchmarks. Through simulations, we highlight optimized data-sharing strategies for scalable, automated systems, ensuring resilience in complex, real-world environments. PANAMA bridges the gap between network-aware decision-making and robust multi-agent coordination, advancing the synergy between DTs, wireless networks, and AI-driven automation.

Abstract: Sarcasm detection is a crucial yet challenging Natural Language Processing task. Existing Large Language Model methods are often limited by single-perspective analysis, static reasoning pathways, and a susceptibility to hallucination when processing complex ironic rhetoric, which impacts their accuracy and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose **SEVADE**, a novel **S**elf-**Ev**olving multi-agent **A**nalysis framework with **D**ecoupled **E**valuation for hallucination-resistant sarcasm detection. The core of our framework is a Dynamic Agentive Reasoning Engine (DARE), which utilizes a team of specialized agents grounded in linguistic theory to perform a multifaceted deconstruction of the text and generate a structured reasoning chain. Subsequently, a separate lightweight rationale adjudicator (RA) performs the final classification based solely on this reasoning chain. This decoupled architecture is designed to mitigate the risk of hallucination by separating complex reasoning from the final judgment. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average improvements of **6.75%** in Accuracy and **6.29%** in Macro-F1 score.

Abstract: Offline-to-online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) aims to perform online fine-tuning on an offline pre-trained policy to minimize costly online interactions. Existing work used offline datasets to generate data that conform to the online data distribution for data augmentation. However, generated data still exhibits a gap with the online data, limiting overall performance. To address this, we propose a new data augmentation approach, Classifier-Free Diffusion Generation (CFDG). Without introducing additional classifier training overhead, CFDG leverages classifier-free guidance diffusion to significantly enhance the generation quality of offline and online data with different distributions. Additionally, it employs a reweighting method to enable more generated data to align with the online data, enhancing performance while maintaining the agent's stability. Experimental results show that CFDG outperforms replaying the two data types or using a standard diffusion model to generate new data. Our method is versatile and can be integrated with existing offline-to-online RL algorithms. By implementing CFDG to popular methods IQL, PEX and APL, we achieve a notable 15% average improvement in empirical performance on the D4RL benchmark such as MuJoCo and AntMaze.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to coordinate multiple agents to achieve a common goal. A key challenge in MARL is credit assignment, which involves assessing each agent's contribution to the shared reward. Given the diversity of tasks, agents may perform different types of coordination, with rewards attributed to diverse and often overlapping agent subsets. In this work, we formalize the credit assignment level as the number of agents cooperating to obtain a reward, and address scenarios with multiple coexisting levels. We introduce a multi-level advantage formulation that performs explicit counterfactual reasoning to infer credits across distinct levels. Our method, Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment (MACA), captures agent contributions at multiple levels by integrating advantage functions that reason about individual, joint, and correlated actions. Utilizing an attention-based framework, MACA identifies correlated agent relationships and constructs multi-level advantages to guide policy learning. Comprehensive experiments on challenging Starcraft v1\&amp;v2 tasks demonstrate MACA's superior performance, underscoring its efficacy in complex credit assignment scenarios.

arXiv:2508.06871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasticity loss, a diminishing capacity to adapt as training progresses, is a critical challenge in deep reinforcement learning. We examine this issue in multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL), where higher representational flexibility is crucial for managing diverse and potentially conflicting task demands. We systematically explore how sparsification methods, particularly Gradual Magnitude Pruning (GMP) and Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET), enhance plasticity and consequently improve performance in MTRL agents. We evaluate these approaches across distinct MTRL architectures (shared backbone, Mixture of Experts, Mixture of Orthogonal Experts) on standardized MTRL benchmarks, comparing against dense baselines, and a comprehensive range of alternative plasticity-inducing or regularization methods. Our results demonstrate that both GMP and SET effectively mitigate key indicators of plasticity degradation, such as neuron dormancy and representational collapse. These plasticity improvements often correlate with enhanced multi-task performance, with sparse agents frequently outperforming dense counterparts and achieving competitive results against explicit plasticity interventions. Our findings offer insights into the interplay between plasticity, network sparsity, and MTRL designs, highlighting dynamic sparsification as a robust but context-sensitive tool for developing more adaptable MTRL systems.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are automata structures that encode (non-Markovian) reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL). RMs can reward any behaviour representable in regular languages and, when paired with RL algorithms that exploit RM structure, have been shown to significantly improve sample efficiency in many domains. In this work, we present pushdown reward machines (pdRMs), an extension of reward machines based on deterministic pushdown automata. pdRMs can recognize and reward temporally extended behaviours representable in deterministic context-free languages, making them more expressive than reward machines. We introduce two variants of pdRM-based policies, one which has access to the entire stack of the pdRM, and one which can only access the top $k$ symbols (for a given constant $k$) of the stack. We propose a procedure to check when the two kinds of policies (for a given environment, pdRM, and constant $k$) achieve the same optimal expected reward. We then provide theoretical results establishing the expressive power of pdRMs, and space complexity results about the proposed learning problems. Finally, we provide experimental results showing how agents can be trained to perform tasks representable in deterministic context-free languages using pdRMs.

<title>GDBA Revisited: Unleashing the Power of Guided Local Search for Distributed Constraint Optimization</title>

Abstract: Local search is an important class of incomplete algorithms for solving Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) but it often converges to poor local optima. While GDBA provides a comprehensive rule set to escape premature convergence, its empirical benefits remain marginal on general-valued problems. In this work, we systematically examine GDBA and identify three factors that potentially lead to its inferior performance, i.e., over-aggressive constraint violation conditions, unbounded penalty accumulation, and uncoordinated penalty updates. To address these issues, we propose Distributed Guided Local Search (DGLS), a novel GLS framework for DCOPs that incorporates an adaptive violation condition to selectively penalize constraints with high cost, a penalty evaporation mechanism to control the magnitude of penalization, and a synchronization scheme for coordinated penalty updates. We theoretically show that the penalty values are bounded, and agents play a potential game in our DGLS. Our extensive empirical results on various standard benchmarks demonstrate the great superiority of DGLS over state-of-the-art baselines. Particularly, compared to Damped Max-sum with high damping factors (e.g., 0.7 or 0.9), our DGLS achieves competitive performance on general-valued problems, and outperforms it by significant margins (\textbf{3.77\%--66.3\%}) on structured problems in terms of anytime results.

Abstract: Visual designers naturally draw inspiration from multiple visual references, combining diverse elements and aesthetic principles to create artwork. However, current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs -- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references. We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990 synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33 reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual inspiration. The dataset is publicly available at: https://multiref.github.io/.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation tasks have driven remarkable advances in diverse media applications, yet most focus on single-turn scenarios and struggle with iterative, multi-turn creative tasks. Recent dialogue-based systems attempt to bridge this gap, but their single-agent, sequential paradigm often causes intention drift and incoherent edits. To address these limitations, we present Talk2Image, a novel multi-agent system for interactive image generation and editing in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Our approach integrates three key components: intention parsing from dialogue history, task decomposition and collaborative execution across specialized agents, and feedback-driven refinement based on a multi-view evaluation mechanism. Talk2Image enables step-by-step alignment with user intention and consistent image editing. Experiments demonstrate that Talk2Image outperforms existing baselines in controllability, coherence, and user satisfaction across iterative image generation and editing tasks.

<title>Kairos: Low-latency Multi-Agent Serving with Shared LLMs and Excessive Loads in the Public Cloud</title>

Abstract: Multi-agent applications utilize the advanced capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for intricate task completion through agent collaboration in a workflow. Under this situation, requests from different agents usually access the same shared LLM to perform different kinds of tasks, forcing the shared LLM to suffer excessive loads. However, existing works have low serving performance for these multi-agent applications, mainly due to the ignorance of inter-agent latency and resource differences for request scheduling. We therefore propose Kairos, a multi-agent orchestration system that optimizes end-to-end latency for multi-agent applications. Kairos consists of a workflow orchestrator, a workflow-aware priority scheduler, and a memory-aware dispatcher. The orchestrator collects agent-specific information for online workflow analysis. The scheduler decides the serving priority of the requests based on their latency characteristics to reduce the overall queuing. The dispatcher dispatches the requests to different LLM instances based on their memory demands to avoid GPU overloading. Experimental results show that Kairos reduces end-to-end latency by 17.8% to 28.4% compared to state-of-the-art works.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has fundamentally shifted the bottleneck in AI development from computational power to data availability-with countless valuable datasets remaining hidden across specialized repositories, research appendices, and domain platforms. As reasoning capabilities and deep research methodologies continue to evolve, a critical question emerges: can AI agents transcend conventional search to systematically discover any dataset that meets specific user requirements, enabling truly autonomous demand-driven data curation? We introduce DatasetResearch, the first comprehensive benchmark evaluating AI agents' ability to discover and synthesize datasets from 208 real-world demands across knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive tasks. Our tri-dimensional evaluation framework reveals a stark reality: even advanced deep research systems achieve only 22% score on our challenging DatasetResearch-pro subset, exposing the vast gap between current capabilities and perfect dataset discovery. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental dichotomy-search agents excel at knowledge tasks through retrieval breadth, while synthesis agents dominate reasoning challenges via structured generation-yet both catastrophically fail on "corner cases" outside existing distributions. These findings establish the first rigorous baseline for dataset discovery agents and illuminate the path toward AI systems capable of finding any dataset in the digital universe. Our benchmark and comprehensive analysis provide the foundation for the next generation of self-improving AI systems and are publicly available at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/DatasetResearch.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face persistent and evolving trustworthiness issues, motivating developers to seek automated and flexible repair methods that enable convenient deployment across diverse scenarios. Existing repair methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) are costly and slow, while prompt engineering lacks robustness and scalability. Representation engineering, which steers model behavior by injecting targeted concept vectors during inference, offers a lightweight, training-free alternative. However, current approaches depend on manually crafted samples and fixed steering strategies, limiting automation and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose MASteer, the first end-to-end framework for trustworthiness repair in LLMs based on representation engineering. MASteer integrates two core components: AutoTester, a multi-agent system that generates diverse, high-quality steer samples tailored to developer needs; and AutoRepairer, which constructs adaptive steering strategies with anchor vectors for automated, context-aware strategy selection during inference. Experiments on standard and customized trustworthiness tasks show MASteer consistently outperforms baselines, improving metrics by 15.36% on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Chat and 4.21% on Qwen-3-8B-Chat, while maintaining general model capabilities. MASteer demonstrates strong robustness, generalization, and practical value for scalable, efficient trustworthiness repair.

Abstract: With recent and rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), understanding the foundation of purposeful behaviour in autonomous agents is crucial for developing safe and efficient systems. While artificial neural networks have dominated the path to AI, recent studies are exploring the potential of biologically based systems, such as networks of living biological neuronal networks. Along with promises of high power and data efficiency, these systems may also inform more explainable and biologically plausible models. In this work, we propose a framework rooted in active inference, a general theory of behaviour, to model decision-making in embodied agents. Using experiment-informed generative models, we simulate decision-making processes in a simulated game-play environment, mirroring experimental setups that use biological neurons. Our results demonstrate learning in these agents, providing insights into the role of memory-based learning and predictive planning in intelligent decision-making. This work contributes to the growing field of explainable AI by offering a biologically grounded and scalable approach to understanding purposeful behaviour in agents.

Abstract: Semantic navigation requires an agent to navigate toward a specified target in an unseen environment. Employing an imaginative navigation strategy that predicts future scenes before taking action, can empower the agent to find target faster. Inspired by this idea, we propose SGImagineNav, a novel imaginative navigation framework that leverages symbolic world modeling to proactively build a global environmental representation. SGImagineNav maintains an evolving hierarchical scene graphs and uses large language models to predict and explore unseen parts of the environment. While existing methods solely relying on past observations, this imaginative scene graph provides richer semantic context, enabling the agent to proactively estimate target locations. Building upon this, SGImagineNav adopts an adaptive navigation strategy that exploits semantic shortcuts when promising and explores unknown areas otherwise to gather additional context. This strategy continuously expands the known environment and accumulates valuable semantic contexts, ultimately guiding the agent toward the target. SGImagineNav is evaluated in both real-world scenarios and simulation benchmarks. SGImagineNav consistently outperforms previous methods, improving success rate to 65.4 and 66.8 on HM3D and HSSD, and demonstrating cross-floor and cross-room navigation in real-world environments, underscoring its effectiveness and generalizability.

Abstract: With wireless devices increasingly forming a unified smart network for seamless, user-friendly operations, random access (RA) medium access control (MAC) design is considered a key solution for handling unpredictable data traffic from multiple terminals. However, it remains challenging to design an effective RA-based MAC protocol to minimize collisions and ensure transmission fairness across the devices. While existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) have been proposed to optimize RA performance, their reliance on centralized training and the significant overhead required for information collection can make real-world applications unrealistic. In this work, we adopt a fully decentralized MARL architecture, where policy learning does not rely on centralized tasks but leverages consensus-based information exchanges across devices. We design our MARL algorithm over an actor-critic (AC) network and propose exchanging only local rewards to minimize communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical proof of global convergence for our approach. Numerical experiments show that our proposed MARL algorithm can significantly improve RA network performance compared to other baselines.

<title>Narrative Memory in Machines: Multi-Agent Arc Extraction in Serialized TV</title>

Abstract: Serialized television narratives present significant analytical challenges due to their complex, temporally distributed storylines that necessitate sophisticated information management. This paper introduces a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to extract and analyze narrative arcs by implementing principles of computational memory architectures. The system conceptualizes narrative understanding through analogues of human memory: Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a form of semantic memory for general narrative patterns, while a vector database stores specific arc progressions as episodic memories. A multi-agent workflow simulates working memory processes to integrate these information types. Tested on the first season of Grey's Anatomy (ABC 2005-), the MAS identifies three arc types: Anthology (self-contained), Soap (relationship-focused), and Genre-Specific. These arcs and their episodic developments are stored in a vector database, facilitating structured analysis and semantic comparison. To bridge automation with critical interpretation, a graphical interface enables human oversight and refinement of the system's narrative memory. While demonstrating strong performance in identifying Anthology Arcs and character entities, the system's reliance on textual paratexts (episode summaries) revealed limitations in discerning overlapping arcs and opaque dynamics, underscoring the challenges in computational memory consolidation versus human holistic understanding. This memory-centric approach highlights the potential of combining AI-driven memory processing with human expertise. Beyond television, it offers promise for serialized written formats where narrative is entirely text-based. Future work will focus on integrating multimodal inputs to enrich episodic memory, refining memory integration mechanisms within the MAS, and expanding testing across diverse genres.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature in PDF format necessitates advanced tools for efficient and accurate document understanding, summarization, and content optimization. Traditional methods fall short in handling complex layouts and multimodal content, while direct application of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) lacks precision and control for intricate editing tasks. This paper introduces DocRefine, an innovative framework designed for intelligent understanding, content refinement, and automated summarization of scientific PDF documents, driven by natural language instructions. DocRefine leverages the power of advanced LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) by orchestrating a sophisticated multi-agent system comprising six specialized and collaborative agents: Layout & Structure Analysis, Multimodal Content Understanding, Instruction Decomposition, Content Refinement, Summarization & Generation, and Fidelity & Consistency Verification. This closed-loop feedback architecture ensures high semantic accuracy and visual fidelity. Evaluated on the comprehensive DocEditBench dataset, DocRefine consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various tasks, achieving overall scores of 86.7% for Semantic Consistency Score (SCS), 93.9% for Layout Fidelity Index (LFI), and 85.0% for Instruction Adherence Rate (IAR). These results demonstrate DocRefine's superior capability in handling complex multimodal document editing, preserving semantic integrity, and maintaining visual consistency, marking a significant advancement in automated scientific document processing.

<title>From Imitation to Optimization: A Comparative Study of Offline Learning for Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Learning robust driving policies from large-scale, real-world datasets is a central challenge in autonomous driving, as online data collection is often unsafe and impractical. While Behavioral Cloning (BC) offers a straightforward approach to imitation learning, policies trained with BC are notoriously brittle and suffer from compounding errors in closed-loop execution. This work presents a comprehensive pipeline and a comparative study to address this limitation. We first develop a series of increasingly sophisticated BC baselines, culminating in a Transformer-based model that operates on a structured, entity-centric state representation. While this model achieves low imitation loss, we show that it still fails in long-horizon simulations. We then demonstrate that by applying a state-of-the-art Offline Reinforcement Learning algorithm, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), to the same data and architecture, we can learn a significantly more robust policy. Using a carefully engineered reward function, the CQL agent learns a conservative value function that enables it to recover from minor errors and avoid out-of-distribution states. In a large-scale evaluation on 1,000 unseen scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, our final CQL agent achieves a 3.2x higher success rate and a 7.4x lower collision rate than the strongest BC baseline, proving that an offline RL approach is critical for learning robust, long-horizon driving policies from static expert data.

Abstract: Embodied agents have shown promising generalization capabilities across diverse physical environments, making them essential for a wide range of real-world applications. However, building versatile embodied agents poses critical challenges due to three key issues: dynamic environment perception, open-ended tool usage, and complex multi-task planning. Most previous works rely solely on feedback from tool agents to perceive environmental changes and task status, which limits adaptability to real-time dynamics, causes error accumulation, and restricts tool flexibility. Furthermore, multi-task scheduling has received limited attention, primarily due to the inherent complexity of managing task dependencies and balancing competing priorities in dynamic and complex environments. To overcome these challenges, we introduce $\mathcal{P}^3$, a unified framework that integrates real-time perception and dynamic scheduling. Specifically, $\mathcal{P}^3$ enables 1) \textbf Perceive relevant task information actively from the environment, 2) \textbf Plug and utilize any tool without feedback requirement, and 3) \textbf Plan multi-task execution based on prioritizing urgent tasks and dynamically adjusting task order based on dependencies. Extensive real-world experiments show that our approach bridges the gap between benchmarks and practical deployment, delivering highly transferable, general-purpose embodied agents. Code and data will be released soon.

Abstract: The complexity of modern bioinformatics analysis has created a critical gap between data generation and developing scientific insights. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in scientific reasoning, they remain fundamentally limited when dealing with real-world analytical workflows that demand iterative computation, tool integration and rigorous validation. We introduce K-Dense Analyst, a hierarchical multi-agent system that achieves autonomous bioinformatics analysis through a dual-loop architecture. K-Dense Analyst, part of the broader K-Dense platform, couples planning with validated execution using specialized agents to decompose complex objectives into executable, verifiable tasks within secure computational environments. On BixBench, a comprehensive benchmark for open-ended biological analysis, K-Dense Analyst achieves 29.2% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing language model (GPT-5) by 6.3 percentage points, representing nearly 27% improvement over what is widely considered the most powerful LLM available. Remarkably, K-Dense Analyst achieves this performance using Gemini 2.5 Pro, which attains only 18.3% accuracy when used directly, demonstrating that our architectural innovations unlock capabilities far beyond the underlying model's baseline performance. Our insights demonstrate that autonomous scientific reasoning requires more than enhanced language models, it demands purpose-built systems that can bridge the gap between high-level scientific objectives and low-level computational execution. These results represent a significant advance toward fully autonomous computational biologists capable of accelerating discovery across the life sciences.

<title>Towards Safer AI Moderation: Evaluating LLM Moderators Through a Unified Benchmark Dataset and Advocating a Human-First Approach</title>

Abstract: As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, the need for safer and more reliable moderation has never been greater. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, surpassing earlier models in complexity and performance. Their evaluation across diverse tasks has consistently showcased their potential, enabling the development of adaptive and personalized agents. However, despite these advancements, LLMs remain prone to errors, particularly in areas requiring nuanced moral reasoning. They struggle with detecting implicit hate, offensive language, and gender biases due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Moreover, their reliance on training data can inadvertently reinforce societal biases, leading to inconsistencies and ethical concerns in their outputs. To explore the limitations of LLMs in this role, we developed an experimental framework based on state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to assess human emotions and offensive behaviors. The framework introduces a unified benchmark dataset encompassing 49 distinct categories spanning the wide spectrum of human emotions, offensive and hateful text, and gender and racial biases. Furthermore, we introduced SafePhi, a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Phi-4, adapting diverse ethical contexts and outperforming benchmark moderators by achieving a Macro F1 score of 0.89, where OpenAI Moderator and Llama Guard score 0.77 and 0.74, respectively. This research also highlights the critical domains where LLM moderators consistently underperformed, pressing the need to incorporate more heterogeneous and representative data with human-in-the-loop, for better model robustness and explainability.

Abstract: Although numerous datasets have been developed to support dialogue systems, most existing chit-chat datasets overlook the cultural nuances inherent in natural human conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SEADialogues, a culturally grounded dialogue dataset centered on Southeast Asia, a region with over 700 million people and immense cultural diversity. Our dataset features dialogues in eight languages from six Southeast Asian countries, many of which are low-resource despite having sizable speaker populations. To enhance cultural relevance and personalization, each dialogue includes persona attributes and two culturally grounded topics that reflect everyday life in the respective communities. Furthermore, we release a multi-turn dialogue dataset to advance research on culturally aware and human-centric large language models, including conversational dialogue agents.

<title>Communication-Efficient Multi-Agent 3D Detection via Hybrid Collaboration</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07092</link>

Abstract: Collaborative 3D detection can substantially boost detection performance by allowing agents to exchange complementary information. It inherently results in a fundamental trade-off between detection performance and communication bandwidth. To tackle this bottleneck issue, we propose a novel hybrid collaboration that adaptively integrates two types of communication messages: perceptual outputs, which are compact, and raw observations, which offer richer information. This approach focuses on two key aspects: i) integrating complementary information from two message types and ii) prioritizing the most critical data within each type. By adaptively selecting the most critical set of messages, it ensures optimal perceptual information and adaptability, effectively meeting the demands of diverse communication scenarios.Building on this hybrid collaboration, we present \texttt{HyComm}, a communication-efficient LiDAR-based collaborative 3D detection system. \texttt{HyComm} boasts two main benefits: i) it facilitates adaptable compression rates for messages, addressing various communication requirements, and ii) it uses standardized data formats for messages. This ensures they are independent of specific detection models, fostering adaptability across different agent configurations. To evaluate HyComm, we conduct experiments on both real-world and simulation datasets: DAIR-V2X and OPV2V. HyComm consistently outperforms previous methods and achieves a superior performance-bandwidth trade-off regardless of whether agents use the same or varied detection models. It achieves a lower communication volume of more than 2,006$\times$ and still outperforms Where2comm on DAIR-V2X in terms of AP50. The related code will be released.

<title>Pref-GUIDE: Continual Policy Learning from Real-Time Human Feedback via Preference-Based Learning</title>

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning agents with human feedback is crucial when task objectives are difficult to specify through dense reward functions. While prior methods rely on offline trajectory comparisons to elicit human preferences, such data is unavailable in online learning scenarios where agents must adapt on the fly. Recent approaches address this by collecting real-time scalar feedback to guide agent behavior and train reward models for continued learning after human feedback becomes unavailable. However, scalar feedback is often noisy and inconsistent, limiting the accuracy and generalization of learned rewards. We propose Pref-GUIDE, a framework that transforms real-time scalar feedback into preference-based data to improve reward model learning for continual policy training. Pref-GUIDE Individual mitigates temporal inconsistency by comparing agent behaviors within short windows and filtering ambiguous feedback. Pref-GUIDE Voting further enhances robustness by aggregating reward models across a population of users to form consensus preferences. Across three challenging environments, Pref-GUIDE significantly outperforms scalar-feedback baselines, with the voting variant exceeding even expert-designed dense rewards. By reframing scalar feedback as structured preferences with population feedback, Pref-GUIDE offers a scalable and principled approach for harnessing human input in online reinforcement learning.

Abstract: The inefficiency of selfish routing in congested networks is a classical problem in algorithmic game theory, often captured by the Price of Anarchy (i.e., the ratio between the social cost of decentralized decisions and that of a centrally optimized solution.) With the advent of autonomous vehicles, capable of receiving and executing centrally assigned routes, it is natural to ask whether their deployment can eliminate this inefficiency. At first glance, a central authority could simply compute an optimal traffic assignment and instruct each vehicle to follow its assigned path. However, this vision overlooks critical challenges: routes must be individually rational (no vehicle has an incentive to deviate), and in practice, multiple planning agents (e.g., different companies) may coexist and compete. Surprisingly, we show that such competition is not merely an obstacle but a necessary ingredient for achieving optimal outcomes. In this work, we design a routing mechanism that embraces competition and converges to an optimal assignment, starting from the classical Pigou network as a foundational case.

Abstract: Enterprise data pipelines, characterized by complex transformations across multiple programming languages, often cause a semantic disconnect between original metadata and downstream data. This "semantic drift" compromises data reproducibility and governance, and impairs the utility of services like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and text-to-SQL systems. To address this, a novel framework is proposed for the automated extraction of fine-grained schema lineage from multilingual enterprise pipeline scripts. This method identifies four key components: source schemas, source tables, transformation logic, and aggregation operations, creating a standardized representation of data transformations. For the rigorous evaluation of lineage quality, this paper introduces the Schema Lineage Composite Evaluation (SLiCE), a metric that assesses both structural correctness and semantic fidelity. A new benchmark is also presented, comprising 1,700 manually annotated lineages from real-world industrial scripts. Experiments were conducted with 12 language models, from 1.3B to 32B small language models (SLMs) to large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1. The results demonstrate that the performance of schema lineage extraction scales with model size and the sophistication of prompting techniques. Specially, a 32B open-source model, using a single reasoning trace, can achieve performance comparable to the GPT series under standard prompting. This finding suggests a scalable and economical approach for deploying schema-aware agents in practical applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for summarizing structured enterprise data across multiple dimensions using large language model (LLM)-based agents. Traditional table-to-text models often lack the capacity to reason across hierarchical structures and context-aware deltas, which are essential in business reporting tasks. Our method introduces a multi-agent pipeline that extracts, analyzes, and summarizes multi-dimensional data using agents for slicing, variance detection, context construction, and LLM-based generation. Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms traditional approaches, achieving 83\% faithfulness to underlying data, superior coverage of significant changes, and high relevance scores (4.4/5) for decision-critical insights. The improvements are especially pronounced in categories involving subtle trade-offs, such as increased revenue due to price changes amid declining unit volumes, which competing methods either overlook or address with limited specificity. We evaluate the framework on Kaggle datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in faithfulness, relevance, and insight quality over baseline table summarization approaches.

Abstract: Estimating individualized treatment effects from observational data presents a persistent challenge due to unmeasured confounding and structural bias. Causal Machine Learning (causal ML) methods, such as causal trees and doubly robust estimators, provide tools for estimating conditional average treatment effects. These methods have limited effectiveness in complex real-world environments due to the presence of latent confounders or those described in unstructured formats. Moreover, reliance on domain experts for confounder identification and rule interpretation introduces high annotation cost and scalability concerns. In this work, we proposed Large Language Model-based agents for automated confounder discovery and subgroup analysis that integrate agents into the causal ML pipeline to simulate domain expertise. Our framework systematically performs subgroup identification and confounding structure discovery by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents, which reduces human dependency while preserving interpretability. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that our proposed approach enhances treatment effect estimation robustness by narrowing confidence intervals and uncovering unrecognized confounding biases. Our findings suggest that LLM-based agents offer a promising path toward scalable, trustworthy, and semantically aware causal inference.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 4D scenes from an egocentric perspective-modeling changes in 3D spatial structure over time-is crucial for human-machine interaction, autonomous navigation, and embodied intelligence. While existing egocentric datasets contain dynamic scenes, they lack unified 4D annotations and task-driven evaluation protocols for fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning, especially on motion of objects and human, together with their interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EgoDynamic4D, a novel QA benchmark on highly dynamic scenes, comprising RGB-D video, camera poses, globally unique instance masks, and 4D bounding boxes. We construct 927K QA pairs accompanied by explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enabling verifiable, step-by-step spatio-temporal reasoning. We design 12 dynamic QA tasks covering agent motion, human-object interaction, trajectory prediction, relation understanding, and temporal-causal reasoning, with fine-grained, multidimensional metrics. To tackle these tasks, we propose an end-to-end spatio-temporal reasoning framework that unifies dynamic and static scene information, using instance-aware feature encoding, time and camera encoding, and spatially adaptive down-sampling to compress large 4D scenes into token sequences manageable by LLMs. Experiments on EgoDynamic4D show that our method consistently outperforms baselines, validating the effectiveness of multimodal temporal modeling for egocentric dynamic scene understanding.

Abstract: Automated driving in level 3 autonomy has been adopted by multiple companies such as Tesla and BMW, alleviating the burden on drivers while unveiling new complexities. This article focused on the under-explored territory of micro accidents during automated driving, characterized as not fatal but abnormal aberrations such as abrupt deceleration and snake driving. These micro accidents are basic yet pervasive events that might results in more severe accidents. Through collecting a comprehensive dataset of user generated video recording such micro accidents in natural driving scenarios, this article locates key variables pertaining to environments and autonomous agents using machine learning methods. Subsequently, crowdsourcing method provides insights into human risk perceptions and reactions to these micro accidents. This article thus describes features of safety critical scenarios other than crashes and fatal accidents, informing and potentially advancing the design of automated driving systems.

Abstract: Achieving fully autonomous exploration and navigation remains a critical challenge in robotics, requiring integrated solutions for localisation, mapping, decision-making and motion planning. Existing approaches either rely on strict navigation rules lacking adaptability or on pre-training, which requires large datasets. These AI methods are often computationally intensive or based on static assumptions, limiting their adaptability in dynamic or unknown environments. This paper introduces a bio-inspired agent based on the Active Inference Framework (AIF), which unifies mapping, localisation, and adaptive decision-making for autonomous navigation, including exploration and goal-reaching. Our model creates and updates a topological map of the environment in real-time, planning goal-directed trajectories to explore or reach objectives without requiring pre-training. Key contributions include a probabilistic reasoning framework for interpretable navigation, robust adaptability to dynamic changes, and a modular ROS2 architecture compatible with existing navigation systems. Our method was tested in simulated and real-world environments. The agent successfully explores large-scale simulated environments and adapts to dynamic obstacles and drift, proving to be comparable to other exploration strategies such as Gbplanner, FAEL and Frontiers. This approach offers a scalable and transparent approach for navigating complex, unstructured environments.

Abstract: By building and updating internal cognitive maps, animals exhibit extraordinary navigation abilities in complex, dynamic environments. Inspired by these biological mechanisms, we present a real time robotic navigation system grounded in the Active Inference Framework (AIF). Our model incrementally constructs a topological map, infers the agent's location, and plans actions by minimising expected uncertainty and fulfilling perceptual goals without any prior training. Integrated into the ROS2 ecosystem, we validate its adaptability and efficiency across both 2D and 3D environments (simulated and real world), demonstrating competitive performance with traditional and state of the art exploration approaches while offering a biologically inspired navigation approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for scalable, interactive mental health assessment, but excessive querying by LLMs burdens users and is inefficient for real-world screening across transdiagnostic symptom profiles. We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87% compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71% fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into real-world clinical workflows.

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios. Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The Agentic Service Ecosystem consists of heterogeneous autonomous agents (e.g., intelligent machines, humans, and human-machine hybrid systems) that interact through resource exchange and service co-creation. These agents, with distinct behaviors and motivations, exhibit autonomous perception, reasoning, and action capabilities, which increase system complexity and make traditional linear analysis methods inadequate. Swarm intelligence, characterized by decentralization, self-organization, emergence, and dynamic adaptability, offers a novel theoretical lens and methodology for understanding and optimizing such ecosystems. However, current research, owing to fragmented perspectives and cross-ecosystem differences, fails to comprehensively capture the complexity of swarm-intelligence emergence in agentic contexts. The lack of a unified methodology further limits the depth and systematic treatment of the research. This paper proposes a framework for analyzing the emergence of swarm intelligence in Agentic Service Ecosystems, with three steps: measurement, analysis, and optimization, to reveal the cyclical mechanisms and quantitative criteria that foster emergence. By reviewing existing technologies, the paper analyzes their strengths and limitations, identifies unresolved challenges, and shows how this framework provides both theoretical support and actionable methods for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components: System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents, laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and lifelong agentic systems.

Abstract: Accurately modeling individual vehicle behavior in microscopic traffic simulation remains a key challenge in intelligent transportation systems, as it requires vehicles to realistically generate and respond to complex traffic phenomena such as phantom traffic jams. While traditional human driver simulation models offer computational tractability, they do so by abstracting away the very complexity that defines human driving. On the other hand, recent advances in infrastructure-mounted camera-based roadway sensing have enabled the extraction of vehicle trajectory data, presenting an opportunity to shift toward generative, agent-based models. Yet, a major bottleneck remains: most existing datasets are either overly sanitized or lack standardization, failing to reflect the noisy, imperfect nature of real-world sensing. Unlike data from vehicle-mounted sensors-which can mitigate sensing artifacts like occlusion through overlapping fields of view and sensor fusion-infrastructure-based sensors surface a messier, more practical view of challenges that traffic engineers encounter. To this end, we present the I-24 MOTION Scenario Dataset (I24-MSD)-a standardized, curated dataset designed to preserve a realistic level of sensor imperfection, embracing these errors as part of the learning problem rather than an obstacle to overcome purely from preprocessing. Drawing from noise-aware learning strategies in computer vision, we further adapt existing generative models in the autonomous driving community for I24-MSD with noise-aware loss functions. Our results show that such models not only outperform traditional baselines in realism but also benefit from explicitly engaging with, rather than suppressing, data imperfection. We view I24-MSD as a stepping stone toward a new generation of microscopic traffic simulation that embraces the real-world challenges and is better aligned with practical needs.

Abstract: Language is a ubiquitous tool that is foundational to reasoning and collaboration, ranging from everyday interactions to sophisticated problem-solving tasks. The establishment of a common language can serve as a powerful asset in ensuring clear communication and understanding amongst agents, facilitating desired coordination and strategies. In this work, we extend the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating them with advancements in multi-agent decision-making algorithms. We propose a systematic framework for the design of multi-agentic large language models (LLMs), focusing on key integration practices. These include advanced prompt engineering techniques, the development of effective memory architectures, multi-modal information processing, and alignment strategies through fine-tuning algorithms. We evaluate these design choices through extensive ablation studies on classic game settings with significant underlying social dilemmas and game-theoretic considerations.

Abstract: Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code, this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or predefined workflows.

Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based extension to a Circular Field (CF)-based motion planner for efficient, collision-free trajectory generation in cluttered environments. The proposed approach overcomes the limitations of hand-tuned force field parameters by employing a deep neural network trained to infer optimal planner gains from a single depth image of the scene. The pipeline incorporates a CUDA-accelerated perception module, a predictive agent-based planning strategy, and a dataset generated through Bayesian optimization in simulation. The resulting framework enables real-time planning without manual parameter tuning and is validated both in simulation and on a Franka Emika Panda robot. Experimental results demonstrate successful task completion and improved generalization compared to classical planners.

Abstract: Decentralized min-max optimization allows multi-agent systems to collaboratively solve global min-max optimization problems by facilitating the exchange of model updates among neighboring agents, eliminating the need for a central server. However, sharing model updates in such systems carry a risk of exposing sensitive data to inference attacks, raising significant privacy concerns. To mitigate these privacy risks, differential privacy (DP) has become a widely adopted technique for safeguarding individual data. Despite its advantages, implementing DP in decentralized min-max optimization poses challenges, as the added noise can hinder convergence, particularly in non-convex scenarios with complex agent interactions in min-max optimization problems. In this work, we propose an algorithm called DPMixSGD (Differential Private Minmax Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Descent), a novel privacy-preserving algorithm specifically designed for non-convex decentralized min-max optimization. Our method builds on the state-of-the-art STORM-based algorithm, one of the fastest decentralized min-max solutions. We rigorously prove that the noise added to local gradients does not significantly compromise convergence performance, and we provide theoretical bounds to ensure privacy guarantees. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive experiments across various tasks and models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We present Evo-Sparrow, a deep learning-based agent for AI decision-making in Sparrow Mahjong, trained by optimizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Our model evaluates board states and optimizes decision policies in a non-deterministic, partially observable game environment. Empirical analysis conducted over a significant number of simulations demonstrates that our model outperforms both random and rule-based agents, and achieves performance comparable to a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) baseline, indicating strong strategic play and robust policy quality. By combining deep learning with evolutionary optimization, our approach provides a computationally effective alternative to traditional reinforcement learning and gradient-based optimization methods. This research contributes to the broader field of AI game playing, demonstrating the viability of hybrid learning strategies for complex stochastic games. These findings also offer potential applications in adaptive decision-making and strategic AI development beyond Sparrow Mahjong.

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perception has become a foundational paradigm in autonomous driving, enabling unified spatial representations that support robust multi-sensor fusion and multi-agent collaboration. As autonomous vehicles transition from controlled environments to real-world deployment, ensuring the safety and reliability of BEV perception in complex scenarios - such as occlusions, adverse weather, and dynamic traffic - remains a critical challenge. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of BEV perception from a safety-critical perspective, systematically analyzing state-of-the-art frameworks and implementation strategies across three progressive stages: single-modality vehicle-side, multimodal vehicle-side, and multi-agent collaborative perception. Furthermore, we examine public datasets encompassing vehicle-side, roadside, and collaborative settings, evaluating their relevance to safety and robustness. We also identify key open-world challenges - including open-set recognition, large-scale unlabeled data, sensor degradation, and inter-agent communication latency - and outline future research directions, such as integration with end-to-end autonomous driving systems, embodied intelligence, and large language models.

Abstract: Drafting a Statement of Work (SOW) is a vital part of business and legal projects. It outlines key details like deliverables, timelines, responsibilities, and legal terms. However, creating these documents is often a slow and complex process. It usually involves multiple people, takes several days, and leaves room for errors or outdated content. This paper introduces a new AI-driven automation system that makes the entire SOW drafting process faster, easier, and more accurate. Instead of relying completely on humans, the system uses three intelligent components or 'agents' that each handle a part of the job. One agent writes the first draft, another checks if everything is legally correct, and the third agent formats the document and ensures everything is in order. Unlike basic online tools that just fill in templates, this system understands the meaning behind the content and customizes the SOW to match the needs of the project. It also checks legal compliance and formatting so that users can trust the result. The system was tested using real business examples. It was able to create a full SOW in under three minutes, compared to several hours or days using manual methods. It also performed well in accuracy and quality, showing that it can reduce legal risks and save a lot of time. This solution shows how artificial intelligence can be used to support legal and business professionals by taking care of routine work and helping them focus on more important decisions. It's a step toward making legal processes smarter, faster, and more reliable.

Abstract: LLMs' capabilities are enhanced by using function calls to integrate various data sources or API results into the context window. Typical tools include search, web crawlers, maps, financial data, file systems, and browser usage, etc. Integrating these data sources or functions requires a standardized method. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to supply context to LLMs. However, the evaluation of LLMs and AI Agents' MCP tool use abilities suffer from several issues. First, there's a lack of comprehensive datasets or benchmarks to evaluate various MCP tools. Second, the diverse formats of response from MCP tool call execution further increase the difficulty of evaluation. Additionally, unlike existing tool-use benchmarks with high success rates in functions like programming and math functions, the success rate of real-world MCP tool is not guaranteed and varies across different MCP servers. Furthermore, the LLMs' context window also limits the number of available tools that can be called in a single run, because the textual descriptions of tool and the parameters have long token length for an LLM to process all at once. To help address the challenges of evaluating LLMs' performance on calling MCP tools, we propose MCPToolBench++, a large-scale, multi-domain AI Agent tool use benchmark. As of July 2025, this benchmark is build upon marketplace of over 4k MCP servers from more than 40 categories, collected from the MCP marketplaces and GitHub communities. The datasets consist of both single-step and multi-step tool calls across different categories. We evaluated SOTA LLMs with agentic abilities on this benchmark and reported the results.

<title>Achieving Fair-Effective Communications and Robustness in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks: A Semi-Cooperative Approach</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the fair-effective communication and robustness in imperfect and energy-constrained underwater acoustic sensor networks (IC-UASNs). Specifically, we investigate the impact of unexpected node malfunctions on the network performance under the time-varying acoustic channels. Each node is expected to satisfy Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. However, achieving individual QoS requirements may interfere with other concurrent communications. Underwater nodes rely excessively on the rationality of other underwater nodes when guided by fully cooperative approaches, making it difficult to seek a trade-off between individual QoS and global fair-effective communications under imperfect conditions. Therefore, this paper presents a SEmi-COoperative Power Allocation approach (SECOPA) that achieves fair-effective communication and robustness in IC-UASNs. The approach is distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based, and the objectives are twofold. On the one hand, each intelligent node individually decides the transmission power to simultaneously optimize individual and global performance. On the other hand, advanced training algorithms are developed to provide imperfect environments for training robust models that can adapt to the time-varying acoustic channels and handle unexpected node failures in the network. Numerical results are presented to validate our proposed approach.

<title>Optimization of Private Semantic Communication Performance: An Uncooperative Covert Communication Method</title>

Abstract: In this paper, a novel covert semantic communication framework is investigated. Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the semantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several time slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission to acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being eavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming signals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic information. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for semantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not communicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit power of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic information transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power to maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of the user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine the transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot without the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to standard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional Q network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a lower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action selection and estimation bias of Q values. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality by up to 77.8% and 14.3% compared to the traditional reinforcement learning methods.

Abstract: Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) is critical for dense 5G and beyond deployments, especially in mmWave bands where fiber backhaul is infeasible. We propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for joint link scheduling and resource slicing in dynamic, interference-prone IAB networks. Our method integrates a greedy Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) scheduler to activate access and backhaul links based on traffic and topology, with a multi-agent DDQN allocator for bandwidth and antenna assignment across network slices. This decentralized approach respects strict antenna constraints and supports concurrent scheduling across heterogeneous links. Evaluations across 96 dynamic topologies show 99.84 percent scheduling accuracy and 20.90 percent throughput improvement over baselines. The framework's efficient operation and adaptability make it suitable for dynamic and resource-constrained deployments, where fast link scheduling and autonomous backhaul coordination are vital.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) poses significant challenges in enabling agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex 3D environments. While recent progress has been driven by large-scale pre-training and data augmentation, current methods still struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios, particularly when complex spatial and temporal reasoning is required. In this work, we propose SkillNav, a modular framework that introduces structured, skill-based reasoning into Transformer-based VLN agents. Our method decomposes navigation into a set of interpretable atomic skills (e.g., Vertical Movement, Area and Region Identification, Stop and Pause), each handled by a specialized agent. We then introduce a novel zero-shot Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based router, which dynamically selects the most suitable agent at each time step by aligning sub-goals with visual observations and historical actions. SkillNav achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the R2R benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization to the GSA-R2R benchmark that includes novel instruction styles and unseen environments.

Abstract: Addressing contextual privacy concerns remains challenging in interactive settings where large language models (LLMs) process information from multiple sources (e.g., summarizing meetings with private and public information). We introduce a multi-agent framework that decomposes privacy reasoning into specialized subtasks (extraction, classification), reducing the information load on any single agent while enabling iterative validation and more reliable adherence to contextual privacy norms. To understand how privacy errors emerge and propagate, we conduct a systematic ablation over information-flow topologies, revealing when and why upstream detection mistakes cascade into downstream leakage. Experiments on the ConfAIde and PrivacyLens benchmark with several open-source and closed-sourced LLMs demonstrate that our best multi-agent configuration substantially reduces private information leakage (\textbf{18\%} on ConfAIde and \textbf{19\%} on PrivacyLens with GPT-4o) while preserving the fidelity of public content, outperforming single-agent baselines. These results highlight the promise of principled information-flow design in multi-agent systems for contextual privacy with LLMs.

<title>EMPATHIA: Multi-Faceted Human-AI Collaboration for Refugee Integration</title>

Abstract: Current AI approaches to refugee integration optimize narrow objectives such as employment and fail to capture the cultural, emotional, and ethical dimensions critical for long-term success. We introduce EMPATHIA (Enriched Multimodal Pathways for Agentic Thinking in Humanitarian Immigrant Assistance), a multi-agent framework addressing the central Creative AI question: how do we preserve human dignity when machines participate in life-altering decisions? Grounded in Kegan's Constructive Developmental Theory, EMPATHIA decomposes integration into three modules: SEED (Socio-cultural Entry and Embedding Decision) for initial placement, RISE (Rapid Integration and Self-sufficiency Engine) for early independence, and THRIVE (Transcultural Harmony and Resilience through Integrated Values and Engagement) for sustained outcomes. SEED employs a selector-validator architecture with three specialized agents - emotional, cultural, and ethical - that deliberate transparently to produce interpretable recommendations. Experiments on the UN Kakuma dataset (15,026 individuals, 7,960 eligible adults 15+ per ILO/UNHCR standards) and implementation on 6,359 working-age refugees (15+) with 150+ socioeconomic variables achieved 87.4% validation convergence and explainable assessments across five host countries. EMPATHIA's weighted integration of cultural, emotional, and ethical factors balances competing value systems while supporting practitioner-AI collaboration. By augmenting rather than replacing human expertise, EMPATHIA provides a generalizable framework for AI-driven allocation tasks where multiple values must be reconciled.

<title>Towards Aligning Personalized Conversational Recommendation Agents with Users' Privacy Preferences</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of AI agents, with their complex and context-dependent actions, renders conventional privacy paradigms obsolete. This position paper argues that the current model of privacy management, rooted in a user's unilateral control over a passive tool, is inherently mismatched with the dynamic and interactive nature of AI agents. We contend that ensuring effective privacy protection necessitates that the agents proactively align with users' privacy preferences instead of passively waiting for the user to control. To ground this shift, and using personalized conversational recommendation agents as a case, we propose a conceptual framework built on Contextual Integrity (CI) theory and Privacy Calculus theory. This synthesis first reframes automatically controlling users' privacy as an alignment problem, where AI agents initially did not know users' preferences, and would learn their privacy preferences through implicit or explicit feedback. Upon receiving the preference feedback, the agents used alignment and Pareto optimization for aligning preferences and balancing privacy and utility. We introduced formulations and instantiations, potential applications, as well as five challenges.

<title>Ethics2vec: aligning automatic agents and human preferences</title>

Abstract: Though intelligent agents are supposed to improve human experience (or make it more efficient), it is hard from a human perspective to grasp the ethical values which are explicitly or implicitly embedded in an agent behaviour. This is the well-known problem of alignment, which refers to the challenge of designing AI systems that align with human values, goals and preferences. This problem is particularly challenging since most human ethical considerations refer to \emph{incommensurable} (i.e. non-measurable and/or incomparable) values and criteria. Consider, for instance, a medical agent prescribing a treatment to a cancerous patient. How could it take into account (and/or weigh) incommensurable aspects like the value of a human life and the cost of the treatment? Now, the alignment between human and artificial values is possible only if we define a common space where a metric can be defined and used. This paper proposes to extend to ethics the conventional Anything2vec approach, which has been successful in plenty of similar and hard-to-quantify domains (ranging from natural language processing to recommendation systems and graph analysis). This paper proposes a way to map an automatic agent decision-making (or control law) strategy to a multivariate vector representation, which can be used to compare and assess the alignment with human values. The Ethics2Vec method is first introduced in the case of an automatic agent performing binary decision-making. Then, a vectorisation of an automatic control law (like in the case of a self-driving car) is discussed to show how the approach can be extended to automatic control settings.

Abstract: Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) stand as promising technologies facilitating diverse underwater applications. However, the major design issues of the considered system are the severely limited energy supply and unexpected node malfunctions. This paper aims to provide fair, efficient, and reliable (FER) communication to the imperfect and energy-constrained UWSNs (IC-UWSNs). Therefore, we formulate a FER-communication optimization problem (FERCOP) and propose ICRL-JSA to solve the formulated problem. ICRL-JSA is a deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based optimizer for IC-UWSNs through joint link scheduling and power allocation, which automatically learns scheduling algorithms without human intervention. However, conventional RL methods are unable to address the challenges posed by underwater environments and IC-UWSNs. To construct ICRL-JSA, we integrate deep Q-network into IC-UWSNs and propose an advanced training mechanism to deal with complex acoustic channels, limited energy supplies, and unexpected node malfunctions. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ICRL-JSA scheme with an advanced training mechanism compared to various benchmark algorithms.

<title>Risk Map As Middleware: Towards Interpretable Cooperative End-to-end Autonomous Driving for Risk-Aware Planning</title>

Abstract: End-to-end paradigm has emerged as a promising approach to autonomous driving. However, existing single-agent end-to-end pipelines are often constrained by occlusion and limited perception range, resulting in hazardous driving. Furthermore, their black-box nature prevents the interpretability of the driving behavior, leading to an untrustworthiness system. To address these limitations, we introduce Risk Map as Middleware (RiskMM) and propose an interpretable cooperative end-to-end driving framework. The risk map learns directly from the driving data and provides an interpretable spatiotemporal representation of the scenario from the upstream perception and the interactions between the ego vehicle and the surrounding environment for downstream planning. RiskMM first constructs a multi-agent spatiotemporal representation with unified Transformer-based architecture, then derives risk-aware representations by modeling interactions among surrounding environments with attention. These representations are subsequently fed into a learning-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) module. The MPC planner inherently accommodates physical constraints and different vehicle types and can provide interpretation by aligning learned parameters with explicit MPC elements. Evaluations conducted on the real-world V2XPnP-Seq dataset confirm that RiskMM achieves superior and robust performance in risk-aware trajectory planning, significantly enhancing the interpretability of the cooperative end-to-end driving framework. The codebase will be released to facilitate future research in this field.

<title>Perpetual exploration in anonymous synchronous networks with a Byzantine black hole</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate: ``How can a group of initially co-located mobile agents perpetually explore an unknown graph, when one stationary node occasionally behaves maliciously, under an adversary's control?'' We call this node a ``Byzantine black hole (BBH)'' and at any given round it may choose to destroy all visiting agents, or none. This subtle power can drastically undermine classical exploration strategies designed for an always active black hole. We study this perpetual exploration problem in the presence of at most one BBH, without initial knowledge of the network size. Since the underlying graph may be 1-connected, perpetual exploration of the entire graph may be infeasible. We thus define two variants: \pbmPerpExpl\ and \pbmPerpExplHome. In the former, the agents are tasked to perform perpetual exploration of at least one component, obtained after the exclusion of the BBH. In the latter, the agents are tasked to perform perpetual exploration of the component which contains the \emph{home} node, where agents are initially co-located. Naturally, \pbmPerpExplHome\ is a special case of \pbmPerpExpl. Agents operate under a synchronous scheduler and communicate in a face-to-face model. Our goal is to determine the minimum number of agents necessary and sufficient to solve these problems. In acyclic networks, we obtain optimal algorithms that solve \pbmPerpExpl\ with $4$ agents, and \pbmPerpExplHome\ with $6$ agents in trees. The lower bounds hold even in path graphs. In general graphs, we give a non-trivial lower bound of $2\Delta-1$ agents for \pbmPerpExpl, and an upper bound of $3\Delta+3$ agents for \pbmPerpExplHome. To our knowledge, this is the first study of a black-hole variant in arbitrary networks without initial topological knowledge.

Abstract: As multi-agent systems (MAS) become increasingly prevalent in autonomous systems, distributed control, and edge intelligence, efficient communication under resource constraints has emerged as a critical challenge. Traditional communication paradigms often emphasize message fidelity or bandwidth optimization, overlooking the task relevance of the exchanged information. In contrast, goal-oriented communication prioritizes the importance of information with respect to the agents' shared objectives. This review provides a comprehensive survey of goal-oriented communication in MAS, bridging perspectives from information theory, communication theory, and machine learning. We examine foundational concepts alongside learning-based approaches and emergent protocols. Special attention is given to coordination under communication constraints, as well as applications in domains such as swarm robotics, federated learning, and edge computing. The paper concludes with a discussion of open challenges and future research directions at the intersection of communication theory, machine learning, and multi-agent decision making.

<title>Robust Reinforcement Learning over Wireless Networks with Homomorphic State Representations</title>

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of training Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents over communication networks. The RL paradigm requires the agent to instantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its actions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state updates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial and intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been proposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer specific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these limits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote Reinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents exchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two units: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the environment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs actions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the exchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for quicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that HR3L significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of sample efficiency and adapts to different communication scenarios, including packet losses, delayed transmissions, and capacity limitations.

<title>SimViews: An Interactive Multi-Agent System Simulating Visitor-to-Visitor Conversational Patterns to Present Diverse Perspectives of Artifacts in Virtual Museums</title>

Abstract: Offering diverse perspectives on a museum artifact can deepen visitors' understanding and help avoid the cognitive limitations of a single narrative, ultimately enhancing their overall experience. Physical museums promote diversity through visitor interactions. However, it remains a challenge to present multiple voices appropriately while attracting and sustaining a visitor's attention in the virtual museum. Inspired by recent studies that show the effectiveness of LLM-powered multi-agents in presenting different opinions about an event, we propose SimViews, an interactive multi-agent system that simulates visitor-to-visitor conversational patterns to promote the presentation of diverse perspectives. The system employs LLM-powered multi-agents that simulate virtual visitors with different professional identities, providing diverse interpretations of artifacts. Additionally, we constructed 4 conversational patterns between users and agents to simulate visitor interactions. We conducted a within-subject study with 20 participants, comparing SimViews to a traditional single-agent condition. Our results show that SimViews effectively facilitates the presentation of diverse perspectives through conversations, enhancing participants' understanding of viewpoints and engagement within the virtual museum.

<title>Chimera: Harnessing Multi-Agent LLMs for Automatic Insider Threat Simulation</title>

Abstract: Insider threats, which can lead to severe losses, remain a major security concern. While machine learning-based insider threat detection (ITD) methods have shown promising results, their progress is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data. Enterprise data is sensitive and rarely accessible, while publicly available datasets, when limited in scale due to cost, lack sufficient real-world coverage; and when purely synthetic, they fail to capture rich semantics and realistic user behavior. To address this, we propose Chimera, the first large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that automatically simulates both benign and malicious insider activities and collects diverse logs across diverse enterprise environments. Chimera models each employee with agents that have role-specific behavior and integrates modules for group meetings, pairwise interactions, and autonomous scheduling, capturing realistic organizational dynamics. It incorporates 15 types of insider attacks (e.g., IP theft, system sabotage) and has been deployed to simulate activities in three sensitive domains: technology company, finance corporation, and medical institution, producing a new dataset, ChimeraLog. We assess ChimeraLog via human studies and quantitative analysis, confirming its diversity, realism, and presence of explainable threat patterns. Evaluations of existing ITD methods show an average F1-score of 0.83, which is significantly lower than 0.99 on the CERT dataset, demonstrating ChimeraLog's higher difficulty and utility for advancing ITD research.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to optimize the return given a fixed dataset of agent trajectories without additional interactions with the environment. While algorithm development has progressed rapidly, significant theoretical advances have also been made in understanding the fundamental challenges of offline RL. However, bridging these theoretical insights with practical algorithm design remains an ongoing challenge. In this survey, we explore key intuitions derived from theoretical work and their implications for offline RL algorithms.
  We begin by listing the conditions needed for the proofs, including function representation and data coverage assumptions. Function representation conditions tell us what to expect for generalization, and data coverage assumptions describe the quality requirement of the data. We then examine counterexamples, where offline RL is not solvable without an impractically large amount of data. These cases highlight what cannot be achieved for all algorithms and the inherent hardness of offline RL. Building on techniques to mitigate these challenges, we discuss the conditions that are sufficient for offline RL. These conditions are not merely assumptions for theoretical proofs, but they also reveal the limitations of these algorithms and remind us to search for novel solutions when the conditions cannot be satisfied.

Abstract: We introduce AgentWorld, an interactive simulation platform for developing household mobile manipulation capabilities. Our platform combines automated scene construction that encompasses layout generation, semantic asset placement, visual material configuration, and physics simulation, with a dual-mode teleoperation system supporting both wheeled bases and humanoid locomotion policies for data collection. The resulting AgentWorld Dataset captures diverse tasks ranging from primitive actions (pick-and-place, push-pull, etc.) to multistage activities (serve drinks, heat up food, etc.) across living rooms, bedrooms, and kitchens. Through extensive benchmarking of imitation learning methods including behavior cloning, action chunking transformers, diffusion policies, and vision-language-action models, we demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for sim-to-real transfer. The integrated system provides a comprehensive solution for scalable robotic skill acquisition in complex home environments, bridging the gap between simulation-based training and real-world deployment. The code, datasets will be available at https://yizhengzhang1.github.io/agent_world/

<title>Evaluating Large Language Models as Expert Annotators</title>

Abstract: Textual data annotation, the process of labeling or tagging text with relevant information, is typically costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential as direct alternatives to human annotators for general domains natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness on annotation tasks in domains requiring expert knowledge remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate: whether top-performing LLMs, which might be perceived as having expert-level proficiency in academic and professional benchmarks, can serve as direct alternatives to human expert annotators? To this end, we evaluate both individual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized domains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent discussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are tasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and justifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison. Our empirical results reveal that: (1) Individual LLMs equipped with inference-time techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT), self-consistency) show only marginal or even negative performance gains, contrary to prior literature suggesting their broad effectiveness. (2) Overall, reasoning models do not demonstrate statistically significant improvements over non-reasoning models in most settings. This suggests that extended long CoT provides relatively limited benefits for data annotation in specialized domains. (3) Certain model behaviors emerge in the multi-agent discussion environment. For instance, Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking rarely changes its initial annotations, even when other agents provide correct annotations or valid reasoning.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MASs) are a recent but rapidly evolving technology with the potential to transform chemical engineering by decomposing complex workflows into teams of collaborative agents with specialized knowledge and tools. This review surveys the state-of-the-art of MAS within chemical engineering. While early studies demonstrate promising results, scientific challenges remain, including the design of tailored architectures, integration of heterogeneous data modalities, development of foundation models with domain-specific modalities, and strategies for ensuring transparency, safety, and environmental impact. As a young but fast-moving field, MASs offer exciting opportunities to rethink chemical engineering workflows.

<title>SHIELDA: Structured Handling of Exceptions in LLM-Driven Agentic Workflows</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07935</link>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agentic systems are software systems powered by LLMs that autonomously reason, plan, and execute multi-step workflows to achieve human goals, rather than merely executing predefined steps. During execution, these workflows frequently encounter exceptions. Existing exception handling solutions often treat exceptions superficially, failing to trace execution-phase exceptions to their reasoning-phase root causes. Furthermore, their recovery logic is brittle, lacking structured escalation pathways when initial attempts fail. To tackle these challenges, we first present a comprehensive taxonomy of 36 exception types across 12 agent artifacts. Building on this, we propose SHIELDA (Structured Handling of Exceptions in LLM-Driven Agentic Workflows), a modular runtime exception handling framework for LLM agentic workflows. SHIELDA uses an exception classifier to select a predefined exception handling pattern from a handling pattern registry. These patterns are then executed via a structured handling executor, comprising local handling, flow control, and state recovery, to enable phase-aware recovery by linking exceptions to their root causes and facilitating composable strategies. We validate SHIELDA's effectiveness through a case study on the AutoPR agent, demonstrating effective, cross-phase recovery from a reasoning-induced exception.

<title>Deep Reinforcement Learning with anticipatory reward in LSTM for Collision Avoidance of Mobile Robots</title>

Abstract: This article proposes a collision risk anticipation method based on short-term prediction of the agents position. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, trained on past trajectories, is used to estimate the next position of each robot. This prediction allows us to define an anticipated collision risk by dynamically modulating the reward of a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) agent. The approach is tested in a constrained environment, where two robots move without communication or identifiers. Despite a limited sampling frequency (1 Hz), the results show a significant decrease of the collisions number and a stability improvement. The proposed method, which is computationally inexpensive, appears particularly attractive for implementation on embedded systems.

Abstract: Forensic cause-of-death determination faces systemic challenges, including workforce shortages and diagnostic variability, particularly in high-volume systems like China's medicolegal infrastructure. We introduce FEAT (ForEnsic AgenT), a multi-agent AI framework that automates and standardizes death investigations through a domain-adapted large language model. FEAT's application-oriented architecture integrates: (i) a central Planner for task decomposition, (ii) specialized Local Solvers for evidence analysis, (iii) a Memory & Reflection module for iterative refinement, and (iv) a Global Solver for conclusion synthesis. The system employs tool-augmented reasoning, hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation, forensic-tuned LLMs, and human-in-the-loop feedback to ensure legal and medical validity. In evaluations across diverse Chinese case cohorts, FEAT outperformed state-of-the-art AI systems in both long-form autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death conclusions. It demonstrated robust generalization across six geographic regions and achieved high expert concordance in blinded validations. Senior pathologists validated FEAT's outputs as comparable to those of human experts, with improved detection of subtle evidentiary nuances. To our knowledge, FEAT is the first LLM-based AI agent system dedicated to forensic medicine, offering scalable, consistent death certification while maintaining expert-level rigor. By integrating AI efficiency with human oversight, this work could advance equitable access to reliable medicolegal services while addressing critical capacity constraints in forensic systems.

<title>Exploring the Challenges and Opportunities of AI-assisted Codebase Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent AI code assistants have significantly improved their ability to process more complex contexts and generate entire codebases based on a textual description, compared to the popular snippet-level generation. These codebase AI assistants (CBAs) can also extend or adapt codebases, allowing users to focus on higher-level design and deployment decisions. While prior work has extensively studied the impact of snippet-level code generation, this new class of codebase generation models is relatively unexplored. Despite initial anecdotal reports of excitement about these agents, they remain less frequently adopted compared to snippet-level code assistants. To utilize CBAs better, we need to understand how developers interact with CBAs, and how and why CBAs fall short of developers' needs. In this paper, we explored these gaps through a counterbalanced user study and interview with (n = 16) students and developers working on coding tasks with CBAs. We found that participants varied the information in their prompts, like problem description (48% of prompts), required functionality (98% of prompts), code structure (48% of prompts), and their prompt writing process. Despite various strategies, the overall satisfaction score with generated codebases remained low (mean = 2.8, median = 3, on a scale of one to five). Participants mentioned functionality as the most common factor for dissatisfaction (77% of instances), alongside poor code quality (42% of instances) and communication issues (25% of instances). We delve deeper into participants' dissatisfaction to identify six underlying challenges that participants faced when using CBAs, and extracted five barriers to incorporating CBAs into their workflows. Finally, we surveyed 21 commercial CBAs to compare their capabilities with participant challenges and present design opportunities for more efficient and useful CBAs.

<title>Beyond Ten Turns: Unlocking Long-Horizon Agentic Search with Large-Scale Asynchronous RL</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability, efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online RL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements, with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We open-source our models, training data, and codes in https://github.com/inclusionAI/ASearcher.

Abstract: From professional research to everyday planning, many tasks are bottlenecked by wide-scale information seeking, which is more repetitive than cognitively complex. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated search agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans from this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such "wide-context" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce WideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these large-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated questions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains, grounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale atomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange it into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline ensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most systems achieve overall success rates near 0\%, with the best performer reaching just 5\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple human testers can achieve a near 100\% success rate. These results demonstrate that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and development in agentic search. Our dataset, evaluation pipeline, and benchmark results have been publicly released at https://widesearch-seed.github.io/

Abstract: In this paper, we study a truthful two-obnoxious-facility location problem, in which each agent has a private location in [0, 1] and a public optional preference over two obnoxious facilities, and there is a minimum distance constraint d between the two facilities. Each agent wants to be as far away as possible from the facilities that affect her, and the utility of each agent is the total distance from her to these facilities. The goal is to decide how to place the facilities in [0, 1] so as to incentivize agents to report their private locations truthfully as well as maximize the social utility. First, we consider the special setting where d = 0, that is, the two facilities can be located at any point in [0, 1]. We propose a deterministic strategyproof mechanism with approximation ratio of at most 4 and a randomized strategyproof mechanism with approximation ratio of at most 2, respectively. Then we study the general setting. We propose a deterministic strategyproof mechanism with approximation ratio of at most 8 and a randomized strategyproof mechanism with approximation ratio of at most 4, respectively. Furthermore, we provide lower bounds of 2 and 14/13 on the approximation ratio for any deterministic and any randomized strategyproof mechanism, respectively.

<title>Constrained Distributed Heterogeneous Two-Facility Location Problems with Max-Variant Cost</title>

arXiv:2508.08045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a constrained distributed heterogeneous two-facility location problem, where a set of agents with private locations on the real line are divided into disjoint groups. The constraint means that the facilities can only be built in a given multiset of candidate locations and at most one facility can be built at each candidate location. Given the locations of the two facilities, the cost of an agent is the distance from her location to the farthest facility (referred to as max-variant). Our goal is to design strategyproof distributed mechanisms that can incentivize all agents to truthfully report their locations and approximately optimize some social objective. A distributed mechanism consists of two steps: for each group, the mechanism chooses two candidate locations as the representatives of the group based only on the locations reported by agents therein; then, it outputs two facility locations among all the representatives. We focus on a class of deterministic strategyproof distributed mechanisms and analyze upper and lower bounds on the distortion under the Average-of-Average cost (average of the average individual cost of agents in each group), the Max-of-Max cost (maximum individual cost among all agents), the Average-of-Max cost (average of the maximum individual cost among all agents in each group) and the Max-of-Average cost (maximum of the average individual cost of all agents in each group). Under four social objectives, we obtain constant upper and lower distortion bounds.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in agentic workflows, which are structured sequences of LLM invocations intended to solve complex tasks. However, existing approaches often rely on static templates or manually designed workflows, which limit adaptability to diverse tasks and hinder scalability. We propose AdaptFlow, a natural language-based meta-learning framework inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). AdaptFlow learns a generalizable workflow initialization that enables rapid subtask-level adaptation. It employs a bi-level optimization scheme: the inner loop refines the workflow for a specific subtask using LLM-generated feedback, while the outer loop updates the shared initialization to perform well across tasks. This setup allows AdaptFlow to generalize effectively to unseen tasks by adapting the initialized workflow through language-guided modifications. Evaluated across question answering, code generation, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AdaptFlow consistently outperforms both manually crafted and automatically searched baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results with strong generalization across tasks and models. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/microsoft/DKI_LLM/tree/AdaptFlow/AdaptFlow.

Abstract: Recently, large reasoning models have demonstrated strong mathematical and coding abilities, and deep search leverages their reasoning capabilities in challenging information retrieval tasks. Existing deep search works are generally limited to a single knowledge source, either local or the Web. However, enterprises often require private deep search systems that can leverage search tools over both local and the Web corpus. Simply training an agent equipped with multiple search tools using flat reinforcement learning (RL) is a straightforward idea, but it has problems such as low training data efficiency and poor mastery of complex tools. To address the above issue, we propose a hierarchical agentic deep search framework, HierSearch, trained with hierarchical RL. At the low level, a local deep search agent and a Web deep search agent are trained to retrieve evidence from their corresponding domains. At the high level, a planner agent coordinates low-level agents and provides the final answer. Moreover, to prevent direct answer copying and error propagation, we design a knowledge refiner that filters out hallucinations and irrelevant evidence returned by low-level agents. Experiments show that HierSearch achieves better performance compared to flat RL, and outperforms various deep search and multi-source retrieval-augmented generation baselines in six benchmarks across general, finance, and medical domains.

Abstract: Studies on in-vehicle conversational agents have traditionally relied on pre-scripted prompts or limited voice commands, constraining natural driver-agent interaction. To resolve this issue, the present study explored the potential of a ChatGPT-based in-vehicle agent capable of carrying continuous, multi-turn dialogues. Forty drivers participated in our experiment using a motion-based driving simulator, comparing three conditions (No agent, Pre-scripted agent, and ChatGPT-based agent) as a within-subjects variable. Results showed that the ChatGPT-based agent condition led to more stable driving performance across multiple metrics. Participants demonstrated lower variability in longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, and lane deviation compared to the other two conditions. In subjective evaluations, the ChatGPT-based agent also received significantly higher ratings in competence, animacy, affective trust, and preference compared to the Pre-scripted agent. Our thematic analysis of driver-agent conversations revealed diverse interaction patterns in topics, including driving assistance/questions, entertainment requests, and anthropomorphic interactions. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-powered in-vehicle conversational agents to enhance driving safety and user experience through natural, context-rich interactions.

Abstract: We present TeamMedAgents, a novel multi-agent approach that systematically integrates evidence-based teamwork components from human-human collaboration into medical decision-making with large language models (LLMs). Our approach validates an organizational psychology teamwork model from human collaboration to computational multi-agent medical systems by operationalizing six core teamwork components derived from Salas et al.'s "Big Five" model: team leadership, mutual performance monitoring, team orientation, shared mental models, closed-loop communication, and mutual trust. We implement and evaluate these components as modular, configurable mechanisms within an adaptive collaboration architecture while assessing the effect of the number of agents involved based on the task's requirements and domain. Systematic evaluation of computational implementations of teamwork behaviors across eight medical benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU-Pro Medical, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets, Path-VQA, and PMC-VQA) demonstrates consistent improvements across 7 out of 8 evaluated datasets. Controlled ablation studies conducted on 50 questions per configuration across 3 independent runs provide mechanistic insights into individual component contributions, revealing optimal teamwork configurations that vary by reasoning task complexity and domain-specific requirements. Our ablation analyses reveal dataset-specific optimal teamwork configurations, indicating that different medical reasoning modalities benefit from distinct collaborative patterns. TeamMedAgents represents an advancement in collaborative AI by providing a systematic translation of established teamwork theories from human collaboration into agentic collaboration, establishing a foundation for evidence-based multi-agent system design in critical decision-making domains.

Abstract: The security of LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) is critically threatened by propagation vulnerability, where malicious agents can distort collective decision-making through inter-agent message interactions. While existing supervised defense methods demonstrate promising performance, they may be impractical in real-world scenarios due to their heavy reliance on labeled malicious agents to train a supervised malicious detection model. To enable practical and generalizable MAS defenses, in this paper, we propose BlindGuard, an unsupervised defense method that learns without requiring any attack-specific labels or prior knowledge of malicious behaviors. To this end, we establish a hierarchical agent encoder to capture individual, neighborhood, and global interaction patterns of each agent, providing a comprehensive understanding for malicious agent detection. Meanwhile, we design a corruption-guided detector that consists of directional noise injection and contrastive learning, allowing effective detection model training solely on normal agent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that BlindGuard effectively detects diverse attack types (i.e., prompt injection, memory poisoning, and tool attack) across MAS with various communication patterns while maintaining superior generalizability compared to supervised baselines.

Abstract: Renewable energy integration into microgrids has become a key approach to addressing global energy issues such as climate change and resource scarcity. However, the variability of renewable sources and the rising occurrence of High Impact Low Probability (HILP) events require innovative strategies for reliable and resilient energy management. This study introduces a practical approach to managing microgrid resilience through Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XDRL). It combines the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for decision-making with the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) method to improve the transparency of the actor network's decisions. A case study in Ongole, India, examines a microgrid with wind, solar, and battery components to validate the proposed approach. The microgrid is simulated under extreme weather conditions during the Layla cyclone. LIME is used to analyse scenarios, showing the impact of key factors such as renewable generation, state of charge, and load prioritization on decision-making. The results demonstrate a Resilience Index (RI) of 0.9736 and an estimated battery lifespan of 15.11 years. LIME analysis reveals the rationale behind the agent's actions in idle, charging, and discharging modes, with renewable generation identified as the most influential feature. This study shows the effectiveness of integrating advanced DRL algorithms with interpretable AI techniques to achieve reliable and transparent energy management in microgrids.

<title>MuaLLM: A Multimodal Large Language Model Agent for Circuit Design Assistance with Hybrid Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Conducting a comprehensive literature review is crucial for advancing circuit design methodologies. However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research, inconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit design objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we propose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for circuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design research papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason + Act (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step information retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant, capable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses grounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing of both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive analysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools, automated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates. Unlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM decouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over arbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard LLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining the same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation, overcoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits. To evaluate MuaLLM, we introduce two custom datasets: RAG-250, targeting retrieval and citation performance, and Reasoning-100 (Reas-100), focused on multistep reasoning in circuit design. MuaLLM achieves 90.1% recall on RAG-250, and 86.8% accuracy on Reas-100.

<title>Can LLMs Detect Their Confabulations? Estimating Reliability in Uncertainty-Aware Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect content, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or agentic applications where outputs may be reused as context. In this work, we investigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether LLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of internal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level reliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks, we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.

<title>From Natural Language to Solver-Ready Power System Optimization: An LLM-Assisted, Validation-in-the-Loop Framework</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08147</link>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted agent that automatically converts natural-language descriptions of power system optimization scenarios into compact, solver-ready formulations and generates corresponding solutions. In contrast to approaches that rely solely on LLM to produce solutions directly, the proposed method focuses on discovering a mathematically compatible formulation that can be efficiently solved by off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Directly using LLMs to produce solutions often leads to infeasible or suboptimal results, as these models lack the numerical precision and constraint-handling capabilities of established optimization solvers. The pipeline integrates a domain-aware prompt and schema with an LLM, enforces feasibility through systematic validation and iterative repair, and returns both solver-ready models and user-facing results. Using the unit commitment problem as a representative case study, the agent produces optimal or near-optimal schedules along with the associated objective costs. Results demonstrate that coupling the solver with task-specific validation significantly enhances solution reliability. This work shows that combining AI with established optimization frameworks bridges high-level problem descriptions and executable mathematical models, enabling more efficient decision-making in energy systems

Abstract: Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training, preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future inquiry.

Abstract: We present LL3M, a multi-agent system that leverages pretrained large language models (LLMs) to generate 3D assets by writing interpretable Python code in Blender. We break away from the typical generative approach that learns from a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a code-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration with artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of specialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender scripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code works as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented representation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender constructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse, unconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues for further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or procedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our system: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while iterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared code context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a retrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API documentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions empowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LL3M across diverse shape categories, style and material edits, and user-driven refinements. Our experiments showcase the power of code as a generative and interpretable medium for 3D asset creation. Our project page is at https://threedle.github.io/ll3m.

<title>Forecasting Commodity Price Shocks Using Temporal and Semantic Fusion of Prices Signals and Agentic Generative AI Extracted Economic News</title>

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of commodity price spikes is vital for countries with limited economic buffers, where sudden increases can strain national budgets, disrupt import-reliant sectors, and undermine food and energy security. This paper introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that combines historical commodity price data with semantic signals derived from global economic news, using an agentic generative AI pipeline. The architecture integrates dual-stream Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms to fuse structured time-series inputs with semantically embedded, fact-checked news summaries collected from 1960 to 2023. The model is evaluated on a 64-year dataset comprising normalized commodity price series and temporally aligned news embeddings. Results show that the proposed approach achieves a mean AUC of 0.94 and an overall accuracy of 0.91 substantially outperforming traditional baselines such as logistic regression (AUC = 0.34), random forest (AUC = 0.57), and support vector machines (AUC = 0.47). Additional ablation studies reveal that the removal of attention or dimensionality reduction leads to moderate declines in performance, while eliminating the news component causes a steep drop in AUC to 0.46, underscoring the critical value of incorporating real-world context through unstructured text. These findings demonstrate that integrating agentic generative AI with deep learning can meaningfully improve early detection of commodity price shocks, offering a practical tool for economic planning and risk mitigation in volatile market environments while saving the very high costs of operating a full generative AI agents pipeline.

<title>Understanding Human Limits in Pattern Recognition: A Computational Model of Sequential Reasoning in Rock, Paper, Scissors</title>

Abstract: How do we predict others from patterns in their behavior and what are the computational constraints that limit this ability? We investigate these questions by modeling human behavior over repeated games of rock, paper, scissors from Brockbank & Vul (2024). Against algorithmic opponents that varied in strategic sophistication, people readily exploit simple transition patterns (e.g., consistently playing rock after paper) but struggle to detect more complex sequential dependencies. To understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying these abilities and their limitations, we deploy Hypothetical Minds (HM), a large language model-based agent that generates and tests hypotheses about opponent strategies, as a cognitive model of this behavior (Cross et al., 2024). We show that when applied to the same experimental conditions, HM closely mirrors human performance patterns, succeeding and failing in similar ways. To better understand the source of HM's failures and whether people might face similar cognitive bottlenecks in this context, we performed a series of ablations and augmentations targeting different components of the system. When provided with natural language descriptions of the opponents' strategies, HM successfully exploited 6/7 bot opponents with win rates >80% suggesting that accurate hypothesis generation is the primary cognitive bottleneck in this task. Further, by systematically manipulating the model's hypotheses through pedagogically-inspired interventions, we find that the model substantially updates its causal understanding of opponent behavior, revealing how model-based analyses can produce testable hypotheses about human cognition.

Abstract: We develop a proof-theoretic semantics (P-tS) for second-order logic (S-oL), providing an inferentialist alternative to both full and Henkin model-theoretic interpretations. Our approach is grounded in base-extension semantics (B-eS), a framework in which meaning is determined by inferential roles relative to atomic systems -- collections of rules that encode an agent's pre-logical inferential commitments. We show how both classical and intuitionistic versions of S-oL emerge from this set-up by varying the class of atomic systems. These systems yield modular soundness and completeness results for corresponding Hilbert-style calculi, which we prove equivalent to Henkin's account of S-oL. In doing so, we reframe second-order quantification as systematic substitution rather than set-theoretic commitment, thereby offering a philosophically lightweight yet expressive semantics for higher-order logic. This work contributes to the broader programme of grounding logical meaning in use rather than reference and offers a new lens on the foundations of logic and mathematics.

Abstract: We study information aggregation in networks when agents interact to learn a binary state of the world. Initially each agent privately observes an independent signal which is "correct" with probability $\frac{1}{2}+\delta$ for some $\delta > 0$. At each round, a node is selected uniformly at random to update their public opinion to match the majority of their neighbours (breaking ties in favour of their initial private signal). Our main result shows that for sparse and connected binomial random graphs $\mathcal G(n,p)$ the process stabilizes in a "correct" consensus in $\mathcal O(n\log^2 n/\log\log n)$ steps with high probability. In fact, when $\log n/n \ll p = o(1)$ the process terminates at time $\hat T = (1+o(1))n\log n$, where $\hat T$ is the first time when all nodes have been selected at least once. However, in dense binomial random graphs with $p=\Omega(1)$, there is an information cascade where the process terminates in the "incorrect" consensus with probability bounded away from zero.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to solve the coverage optimization problem in multi-agent systems. The proposed technique offers an optimal solution with a lower cost with respect to conventional Voronoi-based techniques by effectively handling the issue of agents remaining stationary in regions void of information using a ranking function. The proposed approach leverages a novel cost function for optimizing the agents coverage and the cost function eventually aligns with the conventional Voronoi-based cost function. Theoretical analyses are conducted to assure the asymptotic convergence of agents towards the optimal configuration. A distinguishing feature of this approach lies in its departure from the reliance on geometric methods that are characteristic of Voronoi-based approaches; hence can be implemented more simply. Remarkably, the technique is adaptive and applicable to various environments with both known and unknown information distributions. Lastly, the efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulations, and the obtained results are compared with those of Voronoi-based algorithms.

Abstract: The deployment of generative AI (GenAI) models raises significant fairness concerns, addressed in this paper through novel characterization and enforcement techniques specific to GenAI. Unlike standard AI performing specific tasks, GenAI's broad functionality requires ``conditional fairness'' tailored to the context being generated, such as demographic fairness in generating images of poor people versus successful business leaders. We define two fairness levels: the first evaluates fairness in generated outputs, independent of prompts and models; the second assesses inherent fairness with neutral prompts. Given the complexity of GenAI and challenges in fairness specifications, we focus on bounding the worst case, considering a GenAI system unfair if the distance between appearances of a specific group exceeds preset thresholds. We also explore combinatorial testing for assessing relative completeness in intersectional fairness. By bounding the worst case, we develop a prompt injection scheme within an agent-based framework to enforce conditional fairness with minimal intervention, validated on state-of-the-art GenAI systems.

Abstract: Are large language models (LLMs) biased in favor of communications produced by LLMs, leading to possible antihuman discrimination? Using a classical experimental design inspired by employment discrimination studies, we tested widely used LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and a selection of recent open-weight models in binary choice scenarios. These involved LLM-based assistants selecting between goods (the goods we study include consumer products, academic papers, and film-viewings) described either by humans or LLMs. Our results show a consistent tendency for LLM-based AIs to prefer LLM-presented options. This suggests the possibility of future AI systems implicitly discriminating against humans as a class, giving AI agents and AI-assisted humans an unfair advantage.

Abstract: The electrical network reconfiguration problem aims to minimize losses in a distribution system by adjusting switches while ensuring radial topology. The growing use of renewable energy and the complexity of managing modern power grids make solving the reconfiguration problem crucial. Distributed algorithms help optimize grid configurations, ensuring efficient adaptation to changing conditions and better utilization of renewable energy sources. This paper introduces a distributed algorithm designed to tackle the problem of power distribution network reconfiguration with a radiality constraint. This algorithm relies on ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers), where each agent progressively updates its estimation based on the information exchanged with neighboring agents. We show that every agent is required to solve a linearly constrained convex quadratic programming problem and a Minimum Weight Rooted Arborescence Problem (MWRAP) with local weights during each iteration. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in various scenarios, including its application to a 33-bus test system and a real-world network.

Abstract: When working around other agents such as humans, it is important to model their perception capabilities to predict and make sense of their behavior. In this work, we consider agents whose perception capabilities are determined by their limited field of view, viewing range, and the potential to miss objects within their viewing range. By considering the perception capabilities and observation model of agents independently from their motion policy, we show that we can better predict the agents' behavior; i.e., by reasoning about the perception capabilities of other agents, one can better make sense of their actions. We perform a user study where human operators navigate a cluttered scene while scanning the region for obstacles with a limited field of view and range. We show that by reasoning about the limited observation space of humans, a robot can better learn a human's strategy for navigating an environment and navigate with minimal collision with dynamic and static obstacles. We also show that this learned model helps it successfully navigate a physical hardware vehicle in real-time. Code available at https://github.com/labicon/HRMotion-RestrictedView.

Abstract: Modern robotic systems frequently engage in complex multi-agent interactions, many of which are inherently multi-modal, i.e., they can lead to multiple distinct outcomes. To interact effectively, robots must recognize the possible interaction modes and adapt to the one preferred by other agents. In this work, we propose MultiNash-PF, an efficient algorithm for capturing the multimodality in multi-agent interactions. We model interaction outcomes as equilibria of a game-theoretic planner, where each equilibrium corresponds to a distinct interaction mode. Our framework formulates interactive planning as Constrained Potential Trajectory Games (CPTGs), in which local Generalized Nash Equilibria (GNEs) represent plausible interaction outcomes. We propose to integrate the potential game approach with implicit particle filtering, a sample-efficient method for non-convex trajectory optimization. We utilize implicit particle filtering to identify the coarse estimates of multiple local minimizers of the game's potential function. MultiNash-PF then refines these estimates with optimization solvers, obtaining different local GNEs. We show through numerical simulations that MultiNash-PF reduces computation time by up to 50\% compared to a baseline. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, where it successfully accounts for the multi-modal nature of interactions and resolves potential conflicts in real-time.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a novel task enabling Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate in outdoor environments through natural language instructions and visual cues. However, it remains challenging due to the complex spatial relationships in aerial scenes.In this paper, we propose a training-free, zero-shot framework for aerial VLN tasks, where the large language model (LLM) is leveraged as the agent for action prediction. Specifically, we develop a novel Semantic-Topo-Metric Representation (STMR) to enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This is achieved by extracting and projecting instruction-related semantic masks onto a top-down map, which presents spatial and topological information about surrounding landmarks and grows during the navigation process. At each step, a local map centered at the UAV is extracted from the growing top-down map, and transformed into a ma trix representation with distance metrics, serving as the text prompt to LLM for action prediction in response to the given instruction. Experiments conducted in real and simulation environments have proved the effectiveness and robustness of our method, achieving absolute success rate improvements of 26.8% and 5.8% over current state-of-the-art methods on simple and complex navigation tasks, respectively. The dataset and code will be released soon.

Abstract: We consider the problem of decomposing a global task assigned to a multi-agent system, expressed as a formula within a fragment of Signal Temporal Logic (STL), under range-limited communication. Given a global task expressed as a conjunction of local tasks defined over the individual and relative states of agents in the system, we propose representing task dependencies among agents as edges of a suitably defined task graph. At the same time, range-limited communication naturally induces the definition of a communication graph that defines which agents have access to each other's states. Within these settings, inconsistencies arise when a task dependency between a pair of agents is not supported by a corresponding communication link due to the limited communication range. As a result, state feedback control laws previously derived to achieve the tasks' satisfaction can not be leveraged. We propose a task decomposition mechanism to distribute tasks assigned to pairs of non-communicating agents in the system as conjunctions of tasks defined over the relative states of communicating agents, thus enforcing consistency between task and communication graphs. Assuming the super-level sets of the predicate functions composing the STL tasks are bounded polytopes, our task decomposition mechanism can be cast as a parameter optimization problem and solved via state-of-the-art decentralized convex optimization algorithms. To guarantee the soundness of our approach, we present various conditions under which the tasks defined in the applied STL fragment are unsatisfiable, and we show sufficient conditions such that our decomposition approach yields satisfiable global tasks after decomposition.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities for natural language understanding, enabling more intelligent smart home assistants. However, existing systems often rely on cloud-based LLMs, raising concerns around user privacy and system dependency on external connectivity. In this work, we present Harmony, a privacy-preserving and robust smart home assistant powered by the locally deployable Llama3-8B model. Beyond protecting user data, Harmony also addresses reliability challenges of smaller models, such as hallucination and instruction misinterpretation, through structured prompting and modular agent design. Experimental results in both virtual environments and user studies show that Harmony achieves performance comparable to GPT-4-based systems, while enabling offline, proactive, and personalized smart home interaction.

<title>EfficientEQA: An Efficient Approach to Open-Vocabulary Embodied Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is an essential yet challenging task for robot assistants. Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise for EQA, but existing approaches either treat it as static video question answering without active exploration or restrict answers to a closed set of choices. These limitations hinder real-world applicability, where a robot must explore efficiently and provide accurate answers in open-vocabulary settings. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EfficientEQA, a novel framework that couples efficient exploration with free-form answer generation. EfficientEQA features three key innovations: (1) Semantic-Value-Weighted Frontier Exploration (SFE) with Verbalized Confidence (VC) from a black-box VLM to prioritize semantically important areas to explore, enabling the agent to gather relevant information faster; (2) a BLIP relevancy-based mechanism to stop adaptively by flagging highly relevant observations as outliers to indicate whether the agent has collected enough information; and (3) a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method for the VLM to answer accurately based on pertinent images from the agent's observation history without relying on predefined choices. Our experimental results show that EfficientEQA achieves over 15% higher answer accuracy and requires over 20% fewer exploration steps than state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Language-Driven Policy Distillation for Cooperative Driving in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The cooperative driving technology of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for improving the efficiency and safety of transportation systems. Learning-based methods, such as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), have demonstrated strong capabilities in cooperative decision-making tasks. However, existing MARL approaches still face challenges in terms of learning efficiency and performance. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and shown remarkable abilities in various sequential decision-making tasks. To enhance the learning capabilities of cooperative agents while ensuring decision-making efficiency and cost-effectiveness, we propose LDPD, a language-driven policy distillation method for guiding MARL exploration. In this framework, a teacher agent based on LLM trains smaller student agents to achieve cooperative decision-making through its own decision-making demonstrations. The teacher agent enhances the observation information of CAVs and utilizes LLMs to perform complex cooperative decision-making reasoning, which also leverages carefully designed decision-making tools to achieve expert-level decisions, providing high-quality teaching experiences. The student agent then refines the teacher's prior knowledge into its own model through gradient policy updates. The experiments demonstrate that the students can rapidly improve their capabilities with minimal guidance from the teacher and eventually surpass the teacher's performance. Extensive experiments show that our approach demonstrates better performance and learning efficiency compared to baseline methods.

<title>POEX: Towards Policy Executable Jailbreak Attacks Against the LLM-based Robots</title>

Abstract: The integration of LLMs into robots has witnessed significant growth, where LLMs can convert instructions into executable robot policies. However, the inherent vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks brings critical security risks from the digital domain to the physical world. An attacked LLM-based robot could execute harmful policies and cause physical harm. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and rationale of jailbreak attacks against LLM-based robots and answer three research questions: (1) How applicable are existing LLM jailbreak attacks against LLM-based robots? (2) What unique challenges arise if they are not directly applicable? (3) How to defend against such jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first construct a "human-object-environment" robot risks-oriented Harmful-RLbench and then conduct a measurement study on LLM-based robot systems. Our findings conclude that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are inapplicable in robot scenarios, and we identify two unique challenges: determining policy-executable optimization directions and accurately evaluating robot-jailbroken policies. To enable a more thorough security analysis, we introduce POEX (POlicy EXecutable) jailbreak, a red-teaming framework that induces harmful yet executable policy to jailbreak LLM-based robots. POEX incorporates hidden layer gradient optimization to guarantee jailbreak success and policy execution as well as a multi-agent evaluator to accurately assess the practical executability of policies. Experiments conducted on the real-world robotic systems and in simulation demonstrate the efficacy of POEX, highlighting critical security vulnerabilities and its transferability across LLMs. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses to mitigate attacks. Our findings underscore the urgent need for security measures to ensure the safe deployment of LLM-based robots in critical applications.

<title>A Research Agenda for Usability and Generalisation in Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: It is common practice in reinforcement learning (RL) research to train and deploy agents in bespoke simulators, typically implemented by engineers directly in general-purpose programming languages or hardware acceleration frameworks such as CUDA or JAX. This means that programming and engineering expertise is not only required to develop RL algorithms, but is also required to use already developed algorithms for novel problems. The latter poses a problem in terms of the usability of RL, in particular for private individuals and small organisations without substantial engineering expertise. We also perceive this as a challenge for effective generalisation in RL, in the sense that is no standard, shared formalism in which different problems are represented. As we typically have no consistent representation through which to provide information about any novel problem to an agent, our agents also cannot instantly or rapidly generalise to novel problems. In this position paper, we advocate for a research agenda centred around the use of user-friendly description languages for describing problems, such that (i) users with little to no engineering expertise can formally describe the problems they would like to be tackled by RL algorithms, and (ii) algorithms can leverage problem descriptions to effectively generalise among all problems describable in the language of choice.

Abstract: We study partially observable assistance games (POAGs), a model of the human-AI value alignment problem which allows the human and the AI assistant to have partial observations. Motivated by concerns of AI deception, we study a qualitatively new phenomenon made possible by partial observability: would an AI assistant ever have an incentive to interfere with the human's observations? First, we prove that sometimes an optimal assistant must take observation-interfering actions, even when the human is playing optimally, and even when there are otherwise-equivalent actions available that do not interfere with observations. Though this result seems to contradict the classic theorem from single-agent decision making that the value of information is nonnegative, we resolve this seeming contradiction by developing a notion of interference defined on entire policies. This can be viewed as an extension of the classic result that the value of information is nonnegative into the cooperative multiagent setting. Second, we prove that if the human is simply making decisions based on their immediate outcomes, the assistant might need to interfere with observations as a way to query the human's preferences. We show that this incentive for interference goes away if the human is playing optimally, or if we introduce a communication channel for the human to communicate their preferences to the assistant. Third, we show that if the human acts according to the Boltzmann model of irrationality, this can create an incentive for the assistant to interfere with observations. Finally, we use an experimental model to analyze tradeoffs faced by the AI assistant in practice when considering whether or not to take observation-interfering actions.

Abstract: Intelligent embodied agents (e.g. robots) need to perform complex semantic tasks in unfamiliar environments. Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) demonstrates remarkable performance across tasks in open-domain question-answering. However, traditional search engines may retrieve shallow content, limiting the ability of LLMs to handle complex, multi-layered information. To address it, we introduce WebWalkerQA, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to perform web traversal. It evaluates the capacity of LLMs to traverse a website's subpages to extract high-quality data systematically. We propose WebWalker, which is a multi-agent framework that mimics human-like web navigation through an explore-critic paradigm. Extensive experimental results show that WebWalkerQA is challenging and demonstrates the effectiveness of RAG combined with WebWalker, through the horizontal and vertical integration in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Scene graphs have emerged as a structured and serializable environment representation for grounded spatial reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we propose SG^2, an iterative Schema-Guided Scene-Graph reasoning framework based on multi-agent LLMs. The agents are grouped into two modules: a (1) Reasoner module for abstract task planning and graph information queries generation, and a (2) Retriever module for extracting corresponding graph information based on code-writing following the queries. Two modules collaborate iteratively, enabling sequential reasoning and adaptive attention to graph information. The scene graph schema, prompted to both modules, serves to not only streamline both reasoning and retrieval process, but also guide the cooperation between two modules. This eliminates the need to prompt LLMs with full graph data, reducing the chance of hallucination due to irrelevant information. Through experiments in multiple simulation environments, we show that our framework surpasses existing LLM-based approaches and baseline single-agent, tool-based Reason-while-Retrieve strategy in numerical Q\&amp;A and planning tasks.

Abstract: With the continuous development of generative AI's logical reasoning abilities, AI's growing code-generation potential poses challenges for both technical and creative professionals. But how can these advances be directed toward empowering junior researchers and designers who often require additional help to build and express their professional and personal identities? We introduce Frontend Diffusion, a multi-agent coding system transforming user-drawn layouts and textual prompts into refined website code, thereby supporting self-representation goals. A user study with 13 junior researchers and designers shows AI as a human capability enhancer rather than a replacement, and highlights the importance of bidirectional human-AI alignment. We then discuss future work such as leveraging AI for career development and fostering bidirectional human-AI alignment of multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Illegal content on social media poses significant societal harm and necessitates timely removal. However, the impact of the speed of content removal on prevalence, reach, and exposure to illegal content remains underexplored. This study examines the relationship with a systematic analysis of takedown delays using data from the EU Digital Services Act Transparency Database, covering five major platforms over a one-year period. We find substantial variation in takedown delay, with some content remaining online for weeks or even months. To evaluate how these delays affect the prevalence and reach of illegal content and exposure to it, we develop an agent-based model and calibrate it to empirical data. We simulate illegal content diffusion, revealing that rapid takedown (within hours) significantly reduces prevalence, reach, and exposure to illegal content, while longer delays fail to reduce its spread. Though the effect of delay may seem intuitive, our simulations quantify exactly how takedown speed shapes the spread of illegal content. Building on these results, we point to the benefits of faster content removal to effectively curb the spread of illegal content, while also considering the limitations of strict enforcement policies.

Abstract: A long-standing goal in AI is to build agents that can solve a variety of tasks across different environments, including previously unseen ones. Two dominant approaches tackle this challenge: (i) reinforcement learning (RL), which learns policies through trial and error, and (ii) optimal control, which plans actions using a learned or known dynamics model. However, their relative strengths and weaknesses remain underexplored in the setting where agents must learn from offline trajectories without reward annotations. In this work, we systematically analyze the performance of different RL and control-based methods under datasets of varying quality. On the RL side, we consider goal-conditioned and zero-shot approaches. On the control side, we train a latent dynamics model using the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) and use it for planning. We study how dataset properties-such as data diversity, trajectory quality, and environment variability-affect the performance of these approaches. Our results show that model-free RL excels when abundant, high-quality data is available, while model-based planning excels in generalization to novel environment layouts, trajectory stitching, and data-efficiency. Notably, planning with a latent dynamics model emerges as a promising approach for zero-shot generalization from suboptimal data.

Abstract: Understanding collective pedestrian movement is crucial for applications in crowd management, autonomous navigation, and human-robot interaction. This paper investigates the use of sequential deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers, for real-time flock detection in multi-pedestrian trajectories. Our proposed approach consists of a two-stage process: first, a pre-trained binary classification model is used for pairwise trajectory classification, and second, the learned representations are applied to identify multi-agent flocks dynamically.
  We validate our method using real-world group movement datasets, demonstrating its robustness across varying sequence lengths and diverse movement patterns. Experimental results indicate that our model consistently detects pedestrian flocks with high accuracy and stability, even in dynamic and noisy environments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to identify other forms of collective motion, such as convoys and swarms, paving the way for more comprehensive multi-agent behavior analysis.

Abstract: The Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025 caused more than 250 billion dollars in damage and lasted for nearly an entire month before containment. Following our previous work, the Digital Twin Building, we modify and leverage the multi-agent large language model framework as well as the cloud-mapping integration to study the air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires. Recent advances in large language models have allowed for out-of-the-box automated large-scale data analysis. We use a multi-agent large language system comprised of an Instructor agent and Worker agents. Upon receiving the users' instructions, the Instructor agent retrieves the data from the cloud platform and produces instruction prompts to the Worker agents. The Worker agents then analyze the data and provide summaries. The summaries are finally input back into the Instructor agent, which then provides the final data analysis. We test this system's capability for data-based policy recommendation by assessing our Instructor-Worker LLM system's health recommendations based on air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires.

Abstract: Intelligent agents, such as robots, are increasingly deployed in real-world, human-centric environments. To foster appropriate human trust and meet legal and ethical standards, these agents must be able to explain their behavior. However, state-of-the-art agents are typically driven by black-box models like deep neural networks, limiting their interpretability. We propose a method for generating natural language explanations of agent behavior based only on observed states and actions -- without access to the agent's underlying model. Our approach learns a locally interpretable surrogate model of the agent's behavior from observations, which then guides a large language model to generate plausible explanations with minimal hallucination. Empirical results show that our method produces explanations that are more comprehensible and correct than those from baselines, as judged by both language models and human evaluators. Furthermore, we find that participants in a user study more accurately predicted the agent's future actions when given our explanations, suggesting improved understanding of agent behavior.

Abstract: Computational chemistry tools are widely used to study the behaviour of chemical phenomena. Yet, the complexity of these tools can make them inaccessible to non-specialists and challenging even for experts. In this work, we introduce El Agente Q, an LLM-based multi-agent system that dynamically generates and executes quantum chemistry workflows from natural language user prompts. The system is built on a novel cognitive architecture featuring a hierarchical memory framework that enables flexible task decomposition, adaptive tool selection, post-analysis, and autonomous file handling and submission. El Agente Q is benchmarked on six university-level course exercises and two case studies, demonstrating robust problem-solving performance (averaging >87% task success) and adaptive error handling through in situ debugging. It also supports longer-term, multi-step task execution for more complex workflows, while maintaining transparency through detailed action trace logs. Together, these capabilities lay the foundation for increasingly autonomous and accessible quantum chemistry.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have demonstrated great potential in generating and managing code within complex codebases. In this paper, we introduce WebGen-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to measure an LLM-based agent's ability to create multi-file website codebases from scratch. It contains diverse instructions for website generation, created through the combined efforts of human annotators and GPT-4o. These instructions span three major categories and thirteen minor categories, encompassing nearly all important types of web applications. To assess the quality of the generated websites, we use GPT-4o to generate test cases targeting each functionality described in the instructions, and then manually filter, adjust, and organize them to ensure accuracy, resulting in 647 test cases. Each test case specifies an operation to be performed on the website and the expected result after the operation. To automate testing and improve reproducibility, we employ a powerful web-navigation agent to execute tests on the generated websites and determine whether the observed responses align with the expected results. We evaluate three high-performance code-agent frameworks, Bolt.diy, OpenHands, and Aider, using multiple proprietary and open-source LLMs as engines. The best-performing combination, Bolt.diy powered by DeepSeek-R1, achieves only 27.8\% accuracy on the test cases, highlighting the challenging nature of our benchmark. Additionally, we construct WebGen-Instruct, a training set consisting of 6,667 website-generation instructions. Training Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct on Bolt.diy trajectories generated from a subset of this training set achieves an accuracy of 38.2\%, surpassing the performance of the best proprietary model.

We introduce mAIstro, an open-source, autonomous multi-agentic framework for end-to-end development and deployment of medical AI models. The system orchestrates exploratory data analysis, radiomic feature extraction, image segmentation, classification, and regression through a natural language interface, requiring no coding from the user. Built on a modular architecture, mAIstro supports both open- and closed-source LLMs, and was evaluated using a large and diverse set of prompts across 16 open-source datasets, covering a wide range of imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and data types. The agents successfully executed all tasks, producing interpretable outputs and validated models. This work presents the first agentic framework capable of unifying data analysis, AI model development, and inference across varied healthcare applications, offering a reproducible and extensible foundation for clinical and research AI integration. The code is available at: https://github.com/eltzanis/mAIstro

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly adapt and personalize to diverse sets of users, there is an increased risk of systems appropriating sociolects, i.e., language styles or dialects that are associated with specific minoritized lived experiences (e.g., African American English, Queer slang). In this work, we examine whether sociolect usage by an LLM agent affects user reliance on its outputs and user perception (satisfaction, frustration, trust, and social presence). We designed and conducted user studies where 498 African American English (AAE) speakers and 487 Queer slang speakers performed a set of question-answering tasks with LLM-based suggestions in either standard American English (SAE) or their self-identified sociolect. Our findings showed that sociolect usage by LLMs influenced both reliance and perceptions, though in some surprising ways. Results suggest that both AAE and Queer slang speakers relied more on the SAE agent, and had more positive perceptions of the SAE agent. Yet, only Queer slang speakers felt more social presence from the Queer slang agent over the SAE one, whereas only AAE speakers preferred and trusted the SAE agent over the AAE one. These findings emphasize the need to test for behavioral outcomes rather than simply assume that personalization would lead to a better and safer reliance outcome. They also highlight the nuanced dynamics of minoritized language in machine interactions, underscoring the need for LLMs to be carefully designed to respect cultural and linguistic boundaries while fostering genuine user engagement and trust.

Abstract: Large language models excel on static benchmarks, but their ability as self-learning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. We evaluate three prompting strategies: self-reflection, heuristic mutation, and planning across dynamic tasks with open-source models. We find that larger models generally outperform smaller ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, an overly long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks, while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops. Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits persistent limitations in areas like planning and spatial coordination, suggesting that large language models still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while methods like Chain-of-thought improve multi-step reasoning on math word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing education, with LLM-based agents playing a key role in simulating student behavior. A major challenge in student simulation is modeling the diverse learning patterns of students at various cognitive levels. However, current LLMs, typically trained as ``helpful assistants'', target at generating perfect responses. As a result, they struggle to simulate students with diverse cognitive abilities, as they often produce overly advanced answers, missing the natural imperfections that characterize student learning and resulting in unrealistic simulations. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework for student simulation. We begin by constructing a cognitive prototype for each student using a knowledge graph, which captures their understanding of concepts from past learning records. This prototype is then mapped to new tasks to predict student performance. Next, we simulate student solutions based on these predictions and iteratively refine them using a beam search method to better replicate realistic mistakes. To validate our approach, we construct the \texttt{Student\_100} dataset, consisting of $100$ students working on Python programming and $5,000$ learning records. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving $100\%$ improvement in simulation accuracy.

Abstract: Addressing intricate real-world problems necessitates in-depth information seeking and multi-step reasoning. Recent progress in agentic systems, exemplified by Deep Research, underscores the potential for autonomous multi-step research. In this work, we present a cohesive paradigm for building end-to-end agentic information seeking agents from a data-centric and training-stage perspective. Our approach consists of four key stages: (1) browsing data construction, (2) trajectories sampling, (3) supervised fine-tuning for effective cold start, and (4) reinforcement learning for enhanced generalisation. We instantiate this framework in a web agent based on the ReAct, WebDancer. Empirical evaluations on the challenging information seeking benchmarks, GAIA and WebWalkerQA, demonstrate the strong performance of WebDancer, achieving considerable results and highlighting the efficacy of our training paradigm. Further analysis of agent training provides valuable insights and actionable, systematic pathways for developing more capable agentic models. The codes and demo will be released in https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/WebAgent.

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction games has created an increasing need for intelligent frameworks where humans can collaborate with AI agents, particularly in post-pandemic contexts with heightened psychological and social pressures. Social deduction games like Werewolf, traditionally played through verbal communication, present an ideal application for Large Language Models (LLMs) given their advanced reasoning and conversational capabilities. Prior studies have shown that LLMs can outperform humans in Werewolf games, but their reliance on external modules introduces latency that left their contribution in academic domain only, and omit such game should be user-facing. We propose \textbf{Verbal Werewolf}, a novel LLM-based Werewolf game system that optimizes two parallel pipelines: gameplay powered by state-of-the-art LLMs and a fine-tuned Text-to-Speech (TTS) module that brings text output to life. Our system operates in near real-time without external decision-making modules, leveraging the enhanced reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs like DeepSeek V3 to create a more engaging and anthropomorphic gaming experience that significantly improves user engagement compared to existing text-only frameworks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) often struggle to interpret high-resolution images accurately, where fine-grained details are crucial for complex visual understanding. We introduce Zoom-Refine, a novel training-free method that enhances MLLM capabilities to address this issue. Zoom-Refine operates through a synergistic process of \textit{Localized Zoom} and \textit{Self-Refinement}. In the \textit{Localized Zoom} step, Zoom-Refine leverages the MLLM to provide a preliminary response to an input query and identifies the most task-relevant image region by predicting its bounding box coordinates. During the \textit{Self-Refinement} step, Zoom-Refine then integrates fine-grained details from the high-resolution crop (identified by \textit{Localized Zoom}) with its initial reasoning to re-evaluate and refine its preliminary response. Our method harnesses the MLLM's inherent capabilities for spatial localization, contextual reasoning and comparative analysis without requiring additional training or external experts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of Zoom-Refine on two challenging high-resolution multimodal benchmarks.

<title>How Far Are We from Generating Missing Modalities with Foundation Models?</title>

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, their potential as plug-and-play solutions for missing modality reconstruction remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we identify and formalize three potential paradigms for missing modality reconstruction, and perform a comprehensive evaluation across these paradigms, covering 42 model variants in terms of reconstruction accuracy and adaptability to downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals that current foundation models often fall short in two critical aspects: (i) fine-grained semantic extraction from the available modalities, and (ii) robust validation of generated modalities. These limitations lead to suboptimal and, at times, misaligned generations. To address these challenges, we propose an agentic framework tailored for missing modality reconstruction. This framework dynamically formulates modality-aware mining strategies based on the input context, facilitating the extraction of richer and more discriminative semantic features. In addition, we introduce a self-refinement mechanism, which iteratively verifies and enhances the quality of generated modalities through internal feedback. Experimental results show that our method reduces FID for missing image reconstruction by at least 14\% and MER for missing text reconstruction by at least 10\% compared to baselines. Code are released at: https://github.com/Guanzhou-Ke/AFM2.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, possessing capabilities for autonomous planning and action, show great potential across diverse domains. However, their practical deployment is hindered by challenges in aligning their behavior with varied human values, complex safety requirements, and specific compliance needs. Existing alignment methodologies often falter when faced with the complex task of providing personalized context without inducing confabulation or operational inefficiencies. This paper introduces a novel solution: a 'superego' agent, designed as a personalized oversight mechanism for agentic AI. This system dynamically steers AI planning by referencing user-selected 'Creed Constitutions' encapsulating diverse rule sets -- with adjustable adherence levels to fit non-negotiable values. A real-time compliance enforcer validates plans against these constitutions and a universal ethical floor before execution. We present a functional system, including a demonstration interface with a prototypical constitution-sharing portal, and successful integration with third-party models via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Comprehensive benchmark evaluations (HarmBench, AgentHarm) demonstrate that our Superego agent dramatically reduces harmful outputs -- achieving up to a 98.3% harm score reduction and near-perfect refusal rates (e.g., 100% with Claude Sonnet 4 on AgentHarm's harmful set) for leading LLMs like Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-4o. This approach substantially simplifies personalized AI alignment, rendering agentic systems more reliably attuned to individual and cultural contexts, while also enabling substantial safety improvements. An overview on this research with examples is available at https://superego.creed.space.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles. BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances. Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy network. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a robustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm perturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network that ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across various environments in Gymnasium. Keywords: Robust Reinforcement Learning; Behavior Cloning; Lipschitz Neural Network

Abstract: We challenge text-to-image models with generating escape room puzzle images that are visually appealing, logically solid, and intellectually stimulating. While base image models struggle with spatial relationships and affordance reasoning, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes this task into structured stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning, layout synthesis, and local image editing. Specialized agents collaborate through iterative feedback to ensure the scene is visually coherent and functionally solvable. Experiments show that agent collaboration improves output quality in terms of solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance clarity, while maintaining visual quality.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based personalization.

Abstract: Congenital heart disease (CHD) presents complex, lifelong challenges often underrepresented in traditional clinical metrics. While unstructured narratives offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable, patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.

Abstract: Consider a decentralized partially-observed Markov decision problem (POMDP) with multiple cooperative agents aiming to maximize a long-term-average reward criterion. We observe that the availability, at a fixed rate, of entangled states of a product quantum system between the agents, where each agent has access to one of the component systems, can result in strictly improved performance even compared to the scenario where common randomness is provided to the agents, i.e. there is a quantum advantage in decentralized control. This observation comes from a simple reinterpretation of the conclusions of the well-known Mermin-Peres square, which underpins the Mermin-Peres game. While quantum advantage has been demonstrated earlier in one-shot team problems of this kind, it is notable that there are examples where there is a quantum advantage for the one-shot criterion but it disappears in the dynamical scenario. The presence of a quantum advantage in dynamical scenarios is thus seen to be a novel finding relative to the current state of knowledge about the achievable performance in decentralized control problems.

Abstract: We introduce a new approach in which several advanced large language models-specifically GPT-4-0125-preview, Meta-LLAMA-3-70B-Instruct, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.5-Flash-collaborate to both produce and answer intricate, doctoral-level probability problems without relying on any single "correct" reference. Rather than depending on an established ground truth, our investigation focuses on how agreement among diverse models can signal the reliability of their outputs and, by extension, reflect the overall quality of the generated questions. To measure this inter-model alignment, we apply a suite of statistical evaluations, including chi-square tests, Fleiss' Kappa coefficients, and confidence interval calculations, thereby capturing both precision in answers and clarity in question phrasing. Our analysis reveals that Claude and Gemini tend to frame questions more coherently and unambiguously, which is evidenced by their tighter confidence intervals and greater concordance with responding agents. In contrast, LLAMA exhibits wider confidence bands and a lower level of agreement, indicating more variability and reduced consistency in its question formulations. These observations support the notion that a multi-model collaborative strategy not only improves answer dependability but also offers an effective, data-driven mechanism for evaluating and refining question quality when no definitive solution exists. Ultimately, this work delivers actionable insights into enhancing AI-guided reasoning processes through coordinated interactions among heterogeneous language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been leveraged for asset pricing tasks and stock trading applications, enabling AI agents to generate investment decisions from unstructured financial data. However, most evaluations of LLM timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.

Abstract: Quantum magnetic sensing based on spin systems has emerged as a new paradigm for detecting ultra-weak magnetic fields with unprecedented sensitivity, revitalizing applications in navigation, geo-localization, biology, and beyond. At the heart of quantum magnetic sensing, from the protocol perspective, lies the design of optimal sensing parameters to manifest and then estimate the underlying signals of interest (SoI). Existing studies on this front mainly rely on adaptive algorithms based on black-box AI models or formula-driven principled searches. However, when the SoI spans a wide range and the quantum sensor has physical constraints, these methods may fail to converge efficiently or optimally, resulting in prolonged interrogation times and reduced sensing accuracy. In this work, we report the design of a new protocol using a two-stage optimization method. In the 1st Stage, a Bayesian neural network with a fixed set of sensing parameters is used to narrow the range of SoI. In the 2nd Stage, a federated reinforcement learning agent is designed to fine-tune the sensing parameters within a reduced search space. The proposed protocol is developed and evaluated in a challenging context of single-shot readout of an NV-center electron spin under a constrained total sensing time budget; and yet it achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and resource efficiency for wide-range D.C. magnetic field estimation compared to the state of the art.

Abstract: Making a good graphic that accurately and efficiently conveys the desired message to the audience is both an art and a science, typically not taught in the data science curriculum. Visualisation makeovers are exercises where the community exchange feedback to improve charts and data visualizations. Can multi-modal large language models (LLMs) emulate this task? Given a plot in the form of an image file, or the code used to generate it, an LLM, primed with a list of visualization best practices, is employed to semi-automatically generate constructive criticism to produce a better plot. Our system is centred around prompt engineering of a pre-trained model, relying on a combination of userspecified guidelines and any latent knowledge of data visualization practices that might lie within an LLMs training corpus. Unlike other works, the focus is not on generating valid visualization scripts from raw data or prompts, but on educating the user how to improve their existing data visualizations according to an interpretation of best practices. A quantitative evaluation is performed to measure the sensitivity of the LLM agent to various plotting issues across different chart types. We make the tool available as a simple self-hosted applet with an accessible Web interface.

Abstract: The surge in scientific publications challenges traditional review methods, demanding tools that integrate structured metadata with full-text analysis. Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, combining graph queries with vector search offer promise but are typically static, rely on proprietary tools, and lack uncertainty estimates. We present an agentic approach that encapsulates the hybrid RAG pipeline within an autonomous agent capable of (1) dynamically selecting between GraphRAG and VectorRAG for each query, (2) adapting instruction-tuned generation in real time to researcher needs, and (3) quantifying uncertainty during inference. This dynamic orchestration improves relevance, reduces hallucinations, and promotes reproducibility.
  Our pipeline ingests bibliometric open-access data from PubMed, arXiv, and Google Scholar APIs, builds a Neo4j citation-based knowledge graph (KG), and embeds full-text PDFs into a FAISS vector store (VS) using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model. A Llama-3.3-70B agent selects GraphRAG (translating queries to Cypher for KG) or VectorRAG (combining sparse and dense retrieval with re-ranking). Instruction tuning refines domain-specific generation, and bootstrapped evaluation yields standard deviation for evaluation metrics.
  On synthetic benchmarks mimicking real-world queries, the Instruction-Tuned Agent with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) outperforms the baseline, achieving a gain of 0.63 in VS Context Recall and a 0.56 gain in overall Context Precision. Additional gains include 0.24 in VS Faithfulness, 0.12 in both VS Precision and KG Answer Relevance, 0.11 in overall Faithfulness score, 0.05 in KG Context Recall, and 0.04 in both VS Answer Relevance and overall Precision. These results highlight the system's improved reasoning over heterogeneous sources and establish a scalable framework for autonomous, agentic scientific discovery.

Abstract: We present HySemRAG, a framework that combines Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate large-scale literature synthesis and identify methodological research gaps. The system addresses limitations in existing RAG architectures through a multi-layered approach: hybrid retrieval combining semantic search, keyword filtering, and knowledge graph traversal; an agentic self-correction framework with iterative quality assurance; and post-hoc citation verification ensuring complete traceability. Our implementation processes scholarly literature through eight integrated stages: multi-source metadata acquisition, asynchronous PDF retrieval, custom document layout analysis using modified Docling architecture, bibliographic management, LLM-based field extraction, topic modeling, semantic unification, and knowledge graph construction. The system creates dual data products - a Neo4j knowledge graph enabling complex relationship queries and Qdrant vector collections supporting semantic search - serving as foundational infrastructure for verifiable information synthesis. Evaluation across 643 observations from 60 testing sessions demonstrates structured field extraction achieving 35.1% higher semantic similarity scores (0.655 $\pm$ 0.178) compared to PDF chunking approaches (0.485 $\pm$ 0.204, p < 0.000001). The agentic quality assurance mechanism achieves 68.3% single-pass success rates with 99.0% citation accuracy in validated responses. Applied to geospatial epidemiology literature on ozone exposure and cardiovascular disease, the system identifies methodological trends and research gaps, demonstrating broad applicability across scientific domains for accelerating evidence synthesis and discovery.

Abstract: Game theory has long served as a foundational tool in cybersecurity to test, predict, and design strategic interactions between attackers and defenders. The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers new tools and challenges for the security of computer systems; In this work, we investigate whether classical game-theoretic frameworks can effectively capture the behaviours of LLM-driven actors and bots. Using a reproducible framework for game-theoretic LLM agents, we investigate two canonical scenarios -- the one-shot zero-sum game and the dynamic Prisoner's Dilemma -- and we test whether LLMs converge to expected outcomes or exhibit deviations due to embedded biases. Our experiments involve four state-of-the-art LLMs and span five natural languages, English, French, Arabic, Vietnamese, and Mandarin Chinese, to assess linguistic sensitivity. For both games, we observe that the final payoffs are influenced by agents characteristics such as personality traits or knowledge of repeated rounds. Moreover, we uncover an unexpected sensitivity of the final payoffs to the choice of languages, which should warn against indiscriminate application of LLMs in cybersecurity applications and call for in-depth studies, as LLMs may behave differently when deployed in different countries. We also employ quantitative metrics to evaluate the internal consistency and cross-language stability of LLM agents, to help guide the selection of the most stable LLMs and optimising models for secure applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM agentic systems have improved the automation of offensive security tasks, particularly for Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges. We systematically investigate the key factors that drive agent success and provide a detailed recipe for building effective LLM-based offensive security agents. First, we present CTFJudge, a framework leveraging LLM as a judge to analyze agent trajectories and provide granular evaluation across CTF solving steps. Second, we propose a novel metric, CTF Competency Index (CCI) for partial correctness, revealing how closely agent solutions align with human-crafted gold standards. Third, we examine how LLM hyperparameters, namely temperature, top-p, and maximum token length, influence agent performance and automated cybersecurity task planning. For rapid evaluation, we present CTFTiny, a curated benchmark of 50 representative CTF challenges across binary exploitation, web, reverse engineering, forensics, and cryptography. Our findings identify optimal multi-agent coordination settings and lay the groundwork for future LLM agent research in cybersecurity. We make CTFTiny open source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/CTFTiny along with CTFJudge on https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/CTFJudge.

<title>Risk Analysis Techniques for Governed LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: Organisations are starting to adopt LLM-based AI agents, with their deployments naturally evolving from single agents towards interconnected, multi-agent networks. Yet a collection of safe agents does not guarantee a safe collection of agents, as interactions between agents over time create emergent behaviours and induce novel failure modes. This means multi-agent systems require a fundamentally different risk analysis approach than that used for a single agent.
  This report addresses the early stages of risk identification and analysis for multi-agent AI systems operating within governed environments where organisations control their agent configurations and deployment. In this setting, we examine six critical failure modes: cascading reliability failures, inter-agent communication failures, monoculture collapse, conformity bias, deficient theory of mind, and mixed motive dynamics. For each, we provide a toolkit for practitioners to extend or integrate into their existing frameworks to assess these failure modes within their organisational contexts.
  Given fundamental limitations in current LLM behavioural understanding, our approach centres on analysis validity, and advocates for progressively increasing validity through staged testing across stages of abstraction and deployment that gradually increases exposure to potential negative impacts, while collecting convergent evidence through simulation, observational analysis, benchmarking, and red teaming. This methodology establishes the groundwork for robust organisational risk management as these LLM-based multi-agent systems are deployed and operated.

<title>Semantic Reasoning Meets Numerical Precision: An LLM-Powered Multi-Agent System for Power Grid Control</title>

Abstract: The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), and the growing frequency of extreme weather events have significantly increased the complexity of power grid planning, operation, and management. Traditional rule-based systems and numerical optimization approaches often struggle with the scale, dynamics, and adaptability required by modern power networks. This paper introduces Grid-Agent, an autonomous, AI-driven framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and remediate grid violations in real time. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with numerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent generates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers, while a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness via sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability, Grid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that dynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and complexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through optimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment strategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE 69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation performance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and learning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse network topologies. The autonomous nature of the framework makes it particularly suitable for modern smart grid applications requiring rapid response to dynamic operating conditions.

<title>G-UBS: Towards Robust Understanding of Implicit Feedback via Group-Aware User Behavior Simulation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05709</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User feedback is critical for refining recommendation systems, yet explicit feedback (e.g., likes or dislikes) remains scarce in practice. As a more feasible alternative, inferring user preferences from massive implicit feedback has shown great potential (e.g., a user quickly skipping a recommended video usually indicates disinterest). Unfortunately, implicit feedback is often noisy: a user might skip a video due to accidental clicks or other reasons, rather than disliking it. Such noise can easily misjudge user interests, thereby undermining recommendation performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Group-aware User Behavior Simulation (G-UBS) paradigm, which leverages contextual guidance from relevant user groups, enabling robust and in-depth interpretation of implicit feedback for individual users. Specifically, G-UBS operates via two key agents. First, the User Group Manager (UGM) effectively clusters users to generate group profiles utilizing a ``summarize-cluster-reflect" workflow based on LLMs. Second, the User Feedback Modeler (UFM) employs an innovative group-aware reinforcement learning approach, where each user is guided by the associated group profiles during the reinforcement learning process, allowing UFM to robustly and deeply examine the reasons behind implicit feedback. To assess our G-UBS paradigm, we have constructed a Video Recommendation benchmark with Implicit Feedback (IF-VR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal benchmark for implicit feedback evaluation in video recommendation, encompassing 15k users, 25k videos, and 933k interaction records with implicit feedback. Extensive experiments on IF-VR demonstrate that G-UBS significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs and MLLMs, with a 4.0% higher proportion of videos achieving a play rate > 30% and 14.9% higher reasoning accuracy on IF-VR.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has propelled the development of autonomous agents that operate on Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using pure visual input. A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding natural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which accurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a correct semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally appropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these MLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment, which prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address this exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization (AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer generation strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from first principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B and InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative improvements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks designed to test generalization and semantic understanding.

Abstract: Web agents such as Deep Research have demonstrated superhuman cognitive abilities, capable of solving highly challenging information-seeking problems. However, most research remains primarily text-centric, overlooking visual information in the real world. This makes multimodal Deep Research highly challenging, as such agents require much stronger reasoning abilities in perception, logic, knowledge, and the use of more sophisticated tools compared to text-based agents. To address this limitation, we introduce WebWatcher, a multi-modal Agent for Deep Research equipped with enhanced visual-language reasoning capabilities. It leverages high-quality synthetic multimodal trajectories for efficient cold start training, utilizes various tools for deep reasoning, and further enhances generalization through reinforcement learning. To better evaluate the capabilities of multimodal agents, we propose BrowseComp-VL, a benchmark with BrowseComp-style that requires complex information retrieval involving both visual and textual information. Experimental results show that WebWatcher significantly outperforms proprietary baseline, RAG workflow and open-source agents in four challenging VQA benchmarks, which paves the way for solving complex multimodal information-seeking tasks.

<title>A Framework for Inherently Safer AGI through Language-Mediated Active Inference</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with Large Language Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations. We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the system's core design through transparent belief representations and hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures. The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our framework's safety properties. Our approach offers a path toward AGI development that is inherently safer, rather than retrofitted with safety measures.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach that integrates vision foundation models with reinforcement learning to enhance object interaction capabilities in simulated environments. By combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and YOLOv5 with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent operating in the AI2-THOR simulation environment, we enable the agent to perceive and interact with objects more effectively. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across four diverse indoor kitchen settings, demonstrate significant improvements in object interaction success rates and navigation efficiency compared to a baseline agent without advanced perception. The results show a 68% increase in average cumulative reward, a 52.5% improvement in object interaction success rate, and a 33% increase in navigation efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of integrating foundation models with reinforcement learning for complex robotic tasks, paving the way for more sophisticated and capable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Emergent communication (EmCom) with deep neural network-based agents promises to yield insights into the nature of human language, but remains focused primarily on a few subfield-specific goals and metrics that prioritize communication schemes which represent attributes with unique characters one-to-one and compose them syntactically. We thus reinterpret a common EmCom setting, the attribute-value reconstruction game, by imposing a small-vocabulary constraint to simulate double articulation, and formulating a novel setting analogous to naturalistic inflectional morphology (enabling meaningful comparison to natural language communication schemes). We develop new metrics and explore variations of this game motivated by real properties of inflectional morphology: concatenativity and fusionality. Through our experiments, we discover that simulated phonological constraints encourage concatenative morphology, and emergent languages replicate the tendency of natural languages to fuse grammatical attributes.

Abstract: Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Most prior studies focus on estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation), enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving. Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior forecasting, human-AI teaming, and multi-agent coordination.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention, particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety and increasing industrial efficiency.

Abstract: Effective tool retrieval is essential for AI agents to select from a vast array of tools when identifying and planning actions in the context of complex user queries. Despite its central role in planning, this aspect remains underexplored in the literature. Traditional approaches rely primarily on similarities between user queries and tool descriptions, which significantly limits retrieval accuracy, specifically when handling multi-step user requests. To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based tool retrieval framework that captures the semantic relationships between tools and their functional dependencies. Our retrieval algorithm leverages ensembles of 1-hop ego tool graphs to model direct and indirect connections between tools, enabling more comprehensive and contextual tool selection for multi-step tasks. We evaluate our approach on a synthetically generated internal dataset across six defined user classes, extending previous work on coherent dialogue synthesis and too retrieval benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our tool graph-based method achieves 91.85% tool coverage on the micro-average Complete Recall metric, compared to 89.26% for re-ranked semantic-lexical hybrid retrieval, the strongest non-KG baseline in our experiments. These findings support our hypothesis that the structural information in the KG provides complementary signals to pure similarity matching, particularly for queries requiring sequential tool composition.

arXiv:2508.05890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of online Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD), where a team of agents must repeatedly serve dynamically appearing tasks on a shared map. Existing online methods either rely on simple heuristics, which result in poor decisions, or employ complex reasoning, which suffers from limited scalability under real-time constraints. In this work, we focus on the task assignment subproblem and formulate it as a minimum-cost flow over the environment graph. This eliminates the need for pairwise distance computations and allows agents to be simultaneously assigned to tasks and routed toward them. The resulting flow network also supports efficient guide path extraction to integrate with the planner and accelerates planning under real-time constraints. To improve solution quality, we introduce two congestion-aware edge cost models that incorporate real-time traffic estimates. This approach supports real-time execution and scales to over 20000 agents and 30000 tasks within 1-second planning time, outperforming existing baselines in both computational efficiency and assignment quality.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the distributed quantized average consensus problem in open multi-agent systems consisting of communication links that change dynamically over time. Open multi-agent systems exhibiting the aforementioned characteristic are referred to as \textit{open dynamic multi-agent systems} in this work. We present a distributed algorithm that enables active nodes in the open dynamic multi-agent system to calculate the quantized average of their initial states. Our algorithm consists of the following advantages: (i) ensures efficient communication by enabling nodes to exchange quantized valued messages, and (ii) exhibits finite time convergence to the desired solution. We establish the correctness of our algorithm and we present necessary and sufficient topological conditions for it to successfully solve the quantized average consensus problem in an open dynamic multi-agent system. Finally, we illustrate the performance of our algorithm with numerical simulations.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) holds a potential to advance existing educational technologies with capabilities to automatically generate personalised scaffolds that support students' self-regulated learning (SRL). While advancements in large language models (LLMs) promise improvements in the adaptability and quality of educational technologies for SRL, there remain concerns about the hallucinations in content generated by LLMs, which can compromise both the learning experience and ethical standards. To address these challenges, we proposed GenAI-enabled approaches for evaluating personalised SRL scaffolds before they are presented to students, aiming for reducing hallucinations and improving the overall quality of LLM-generated personalised scaffolds. Specifically, two approaches are investigated. The first approach involved developing a multi-agent system approach for reliability evaluation to assess the extent to which LLM-generated scaffolds accurately target relevant SRL processes. The second approach utilised the "LLM-as-a-Judge" technique for quality evaluation that evaluates LLM-generated scaffolds for their helpfulness in supporting students. We constructed evaluation datasets, and compared our results with single-agent LLM systems and machine learning approach baselines. Our findings indicate that the reliability evaluation approach is highly effective and outperforms the baselines, showing almost perfect alignment with human experts' evaluations. Moreover, both proposed evaluation approaches can be harnessed to effectively reduce hallucinations. Additionally, we identified and discussed bias limitations of the "LLM-as-a-Judge" technique in evaluating LLM-generated scaffolds. We suggest incorporating these approaches into GenAI-powered personalised SRL scaffolding systems to mitigate hallucination issues and improve the overall scaffolding quality.

Abstract: In the domain of scientific machine learning, designing effective reward functions remains a challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in environments where task goals are difficult to specify numerically. Reward functions in existing work are predominantly based on heuristics, manual engineering, or task-specific tuning. In this work, we introduce a semantically aligned reinforcement learning method where rewards are computed by aligning the current state with a target semantic instruction using a Sentence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT). Instead of relying on manually defined reward functions, the policy receives feedback based on the reward, which is a cosine similarity between the goal textual description and the statement description in the episode. We evaluated our approach in several environments and showed that semantic reward can guide learning to achieve competitive control behavior, even in the absence of hand-crafted reward functions. Our study demonstrates a correlation between the language embedding space and the conventional Euclidean space. This framework opens new horizons for aligning agent behavior with natural language goals and lays the groundwork for a more seamless integration of larger language models (LLMs) and fluid control applications.

<title>Parameter-free Optimal Rates for Nonlinear Semi-Norm Contractions with Applications to $Q$-Learning</title>

Abstract: Algorithms for solving \textit{nonlinear} fixed-point equations -- such as average-reward \textit{$Q$-learning} and \textit{TD-learning} -- often involve semi-norm contractions. Achieving parameter-free optimal convergence rates for these methods via Polyak--Ruppert averaging has remained elusive, largely due to the non-monotonicity of such semi-norms. We close this gap by (i.) recasting the averaged error as a linear recursion involving a nonlinear perturbation, and (ii.) taming the nonlinearity by coupling the semi-norm's contraction with the monotonicity of a suitably induced norm. Our main result yields the first parameter-free $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$ optimal rates for $Q$-learning in both average-reward and exponentially discounted settings, where $t$ denotes the iteration index. The result applies within a broad framework that accommodates synchronous and asynchronous updates, single-agent and distributed deployments, and data streams obtained either from simulators or along Markovian trajectories.

Abstract: Complex medical decision-making involves cooperative workflows operated by different clinicians. Designing AI multi-agent systems can expedite and augment human-level clinical decision-making. Existing multi-agent researches primarily focus on language-only tasks, yet their extension to multimodal scenarios remains challenging. A blind combination of diverse vision-language models (VLMs) can amplify an erroneous outcome interpretation. VLMs in general are less capable in instruction following and importantly self-reflection, compared to large language models (LLMs) of comparable sizes. This disparity largely constrains VLMs' ability in cooperative workflows. In this study, we propose MedOrch, a mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration framework for medical multimodal decision-making. MedOrch employs an LLM-based mediator agent that enables multiple VLM-based expert agents to exchange and reflect on their outputs towards collaboration. We utilize multiple open-source general-purpose and domain-specific VLMs instead of costly GPT-series models, revealing the strength of heterogeneous models. We show that the collaboration within distinct VLM-based agents can surpass the capabilities of any individual agent. We validate our approach on five medical vision question answering benchmarks, demonstrating superior collaboration performance without model training. Our findings underscore the value of mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration in advancing medical multimodal intelligence. Our code will be made publicly available.

<title>Society of Mind Meets Real-Time Strategy: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Strategic Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive action sequence prediction capabilities but often struggle with dynamic, long-horizon tasks such as real-time strategic games. In a game such as StarCraftII (SC2), agents need to manage resource constraints and adapt to evolving battlefield situations in a partially observable environment. This often overwhelms exisiting LLM-based approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that employs specialized imitation learning agents under a meta-controller called Strategic Planner (SP). By expert demonstrations, each specialized agent learns a distinctive strategy, such as aerial support or defensive maneuvers, and produces coherent, structured multistep action sequences. The SP then orchestrates these proposals into a single, environmentally adaptive plan that ensures local decisions aligning with long-term strategies. We call this HIMA (Hierarchical Imitation Multi-Agent). We also present TEXTSCII-ALL, a comprehensive SC2 testbed that encompasses all race match combinations in SC2. Our empirical results show that HIMA outperforms state of the arts in strategic clarity, adaptability, and computational efficiency, underscoring the potential of combining specialized imitation modules with meta-level orchestration to develop more robust, general-purpose AI agents.

<title>EvolvR: Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning for Story Evaluation to Enhance Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06046</link>

Abstract: Although the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges (LLM-as-a-judge) has been validated, their performance remains limited in open-ended tasks, particularly in story evaluation. Accurate story evaluation is crucial not only for assisting human quality judgment but also for providing key signals to guide story generation. However, existing methods face a dilemma: prompt engineering for closed-source models suffers from poor adaptability, while fine-tuning approaches for open-source models lack the rigorous reasoning capabilities essential for story evaluation. To address this, we propose the Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning (EvolvR) framework. Grounded in pairwise comparison, the framework first self-synthesizes score-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data via a multi-persona strategy. To ensure data quality, these raw CoTs undergo a self-filtering process, utilizing multi-agents to guarantee their logical rigor and robustness. Finally, the evaluator trained on the refined data is deployed as a reward model to guide the story generation task. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three evaluation benchmarks including StoryER, HANNA and OpenMEVA. Furthermore, when served as a reward model, it significantly enhances the quality of generated stories, thereby fully validating the superiority of our self-evolving approach.

Abstract: Modern SoC datapaths include deeply pipelined, domain-specific accelerators, but their RTL implementation and verification are still mostly done by hand. While large language models (LLMs) exhibit advanced code-generation abilities for programming languages like Python, their application to Verilog-like RTL remains in its nascent stage. This is reflected in the simple arithmetic and control circuits currently used to evaluate generative capabilities in existing benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce ArchXBench, a six-level benchmark suite that encompasses complex arithmetic circuits and other advanced digital subsystems drawn from domains such as cryptography, image processing, machine learning, and signal processing. Architecturally, some of these designs are purely combinational, others are multi-cycle or pipelined, and many require hierarchical composition of modules. For each benchmark, we provide a problem description, design specification, and testbench, enabling rapid research in the area of LLM-driven agentic approaches for complex digital systems design.
  Using zero-shot prompting with Claude Sonnet 4, GPT 4.1, o4-mini-high, and DeepSeek R1 under a pass@5 criterion, we observed that o4-mini-high successfully solves the largest number of benchmarks, 16 out of 30, spanning Levels 1, 2, and 3. From Level 4 onward, however, all models consistently fail, highlighting a clear gap in the capabilities of current state-of-the-art LLMs and prompting/agentic approaches.

Abstract: State-of-the-art fact-checking systems combat misinformation at scale by employing autonomous LLM-based agents to decompose complex claims into smaller sub-claims, verify each sub-claim individually, and aggregate the partial results to produce verdicts with justifications (explanatory rationales for the verdicts). The security of these systems is crucial, as compromised fact-checkers, which tend to be easily underexplored, can amplify misinformation. This work introduces Fact2Fiction, the first poisoning attack framework targeting such agentic fact-checking systems. Fact2Fiction mirrors the decomposition strategy and exploits system-generated justifications to craft tailored malicious evidences that compromise sub-claim verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fact2Fiction achieves 8.9\%--21.2\% higher attack success rates than state-of-the-art attacks across various poisoning budgets. Fact2Fiction exposes security weaknesses in current fact-checking systems and highlights the need for defensive countermeasures.

Abstract: This work leverages adaptive social learning to estimate partially observable global states in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems. Unlike existing methods, the proposed approach enables the concurrent operation of social learning and reinforcement learning. Specifically, it alternates between a single step of social learning and a single step of MARL, eliminating the need for the time- and computation-intensive two-timescale learning frameworks. Theoretical guarantees are provided to support the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulation results verify that the performance of the proposed methodology can approach that of reinforcement learning when the true state is known.

Abstract: Table reasoning, including tabular QA and fact verification, often depends on annotated data or complex data augmentation, limiting flexibility and generalization. LLMs, despite their versatility, often underperform compared to simple supervised models. To approach these issues, we introduce PanelTR, a framework utilizing LLM agent scientists for robust table reasoning through a structured scientific approach. PanelTR's workflow involves agent scientists conducting individual investigations, engaging in self-review, and participating in collaborative peer-review discussions. This process, driven by five scientist personas, enables semantic-level transfer without relying on data augmentation or parametric optimization. Experiments across four benchmarks show that PanelTR outperforms vanilla LLMs and rivals fully supervised models, all while remaining independent of training data. Our findings indicate that structured scientific methodology can effectively handle complex tasks beyond table reasoning with flexible semantic understanding in a zero-shot context.

Abstract: We present Big5-Scaler, a prompt-based framework for conditioning large language models (LLMs) with controllable Big Five personality traits. By embedding numeric trait values into natural language prompts, our method enables fine-grained personality control without additional training. We evaluate Big5-Scaler across trait expression, dialogue generation, and human trait imitation tasks. Results show that it induces consistent and distinguishable personality traits across models, with performance varying by prompt type and scale. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of concise prompts and lower trait intensities, providing a efficient approach for building personality-aware dialogue agents.

<title>SLIP: Soft Label Mechanism and Key-Extraction-Guided CoT-based Defense Against Instruction Backdoor in APIs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06153</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.06153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of customized large language model (LLM) agents, a new threat of black-box backdoor attacks has emerged, where malicious instructions are injected into hidden system prompts. These attacks easily bypass existing defenses that rely on white-box access, posing a serious security challenge. To address this, we propose SLIP, a Soft Label mechanism and key-extraction-guided CoT-based defense against Instruction backdoors in APIs. SLIP is designed based on two key insights. First, to counteract the model's oversensitivity to triggers, we propose a Key-extraction-guided Chain-of-Thought (KCoT). Instead of only considering the single trigger or the input sentence, KCoT prompts the agent to extract task-relevant key phrases. Second, to guide the LLM toward correct answers, our proposed Soft Label Mechanism (SLM) prompts the agent to quantify the semantic correlation between key phrases and candidate answers. Crucially, to mitigate the influence of residual triggers or misleading content in phrases extracted by KCoT, which typically causes anomalous scores, SLM excludes anomalous scores deviating significantly from the mean and subsequently averages the remaining scores to derive a more reliable semantic representation. Extensive experiments on classification and question-answer (QA) tasks demonstrate that SLIP is highly effective, reducing the average attack success rate (ASR) from 90.2% to 25.13% while maintaining high accuracy on clean data and outperforming state-of-the-art defenses. Our code are available in https://github.com/CAU-ISS-Lab/Backdoor-Attack-Defense-LLMs/tree/main/SLIP.

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration. This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level, summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety scenarios.

<title>Classification is a RAG problem: A case study on hate speech detection</title>

Abstract: Robust content moderation requires classification systems that can quickly adapt to evolving policies without costly retraining. We present classification using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?"
  Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.

Abstract: Generative models, especially diffusion and flow-based models, have been promising in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, integrating powerful generative models into this framework poses unique challenges. In particular, diffusion and flow-based policies suffer from low sampling efficiency due to their iterative generation processes, making them impractical in time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. To tackle these difficulties, we propose OM2P (Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy), a novel offline MARL algorithm to achieve efficient one-step action sampling. To address the misalignment between generative objectives and reward maximization, we introduce a reward-aware optimization scheme that integrates a carefully-designed mean-flow matching loss with Q-function supervision. Additionally, we design a generalized timestep distribution and a derivative-free estimation strategy to reduce memory overhead and improve training stability. Empirical evaluations on Multi-Agent Particle and MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate that OM2P achieves superior performance, with up to a 3.8x reduction in GPU memory usage and up to a 10.8x speed-up in training time. Our approach represents the first to successfully integrate mean-flow model into offline MARL, paving the way for practical and scalable generative policies in cooperative multi-agent settings.

Abstract: The recent rise of renewable energy produced by many decentralized sources yields interesting market design challenges for electrical grids. Balancing supply and demand in such networks is both a temporal and spatial challenge due to capacity constraints. The recent surge in the number of household-owned batteries, especially in regions with rooftop solar adoption, offers mitigation potential but often acts misaligned with grid-level objectives. In fact, the decision to charge or discharge a household-owned battery is a strategic choice by each battery owner governed by selfish incentives. This calls for an analysis from a game-theoretic point of view.
  We initiate this timely research direction by considering a game-theoretic setting where selfish agents strategically charge or discharge their batteries to increase their profit. In particular, we study a Stackelberg-like market model where a third party introduces price incentives, aiming to optimize renewable energy utilization while preserving grid feasibility. For this, we study the existence and the quality of equilibria under various pricing strategies. We find that the existence of equilibria crucially depends on the chosen pricing and that the obtained social welfare varies widely. This calls for more sophisticated market models and pricing mechanisms and opens up a rich field for future research in Algorithmic Game Theory on incentives in renewable energy networks.

Abstract: In a classic paper, Conant and Ashby claimed that "every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system." Artificial Life has produced many examples of systems that perform tasks with apparently no model in sight; these suggest Conant and Ashby's theorem doesn't easily generalise beyond its restricted setup. Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be fleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a regulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having "beliefs" about its environment, which it "updates" in response to sensory input. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more sophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more broadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that the observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere property of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds regardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic control theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the model is of its environment either way. The model might be trivial, however, and this is how the apparent counterexamples are resolved.

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Partner Design (UPD) - a population-free, multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for robust ad-hoc teamwork that adaptively generates training partners without requiring pretrained partners or manual parameter tuning. UPD constructs diverse partners by stochastically mixing an ego agent's policy with biased random behaviours and scores them using a variance-based learnability metric that prioritises partners near the ego agent's current learning frontier. We show that UPD can be integrated with unsupervised environment design, resulting in the first method enabling fully unsupervised curricula over both level and partner distributions in a cooperative setting. Through extensive evaluations on Overcooked-AI and the Overcooked Generalisation Challenge, we demonstrate that this dynamic partner curriculum is highly effective: UPD consistently outperforms both population-based and population-free baselines as well as ablations. In a user study, we further show that UPD achieves higher returns than all baselines and was perceived as significantly more adaptive, more human-like, a better collaborator, and less frustrating.

Abstract: We study the problem of fair division of a set of indivisible goods with connectivity constraints. Specifically, we assume that the goods are represented as vertices of a connected graph, and sets of goods allocated to the agents are connected subgraphs of this graph. We focus on the widely-studied maximin share criterion of fairness. It has been shown that an allocation satisfying this criterion may not exist even without connectivity constraints, i.e., if the graph of goods is complete. In view of this, it is natural to seek approximate allocations that guarantee each agent a connected bundle of goods with value at least a constant fraction of the maximin share value to the agent. It is known that for some classes of graphs, such as complete graphs, cycles, and $d$-claw-free graphs for any fixed $d$, such approximate allocations indeed exist. However, it is an open problem whether they exist for the class of all graphs.
  In this paper, we continue the systematic study of the existence of approximate allocations on restricted graph classes. In particular, we show that such allocations exist for several well-studied classes, including block graphs, cacti, complete multipartite graphs, and split graphs.

<title>Beyond Prompt-Induced Lies: Investigating LLM Deception on Benign Prompts</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in reasoning, planning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness a critical concern. The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately fabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a significant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such deception by explicitly setting a "hidden" objective through prompting or fine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions. Moving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated deception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this evaluation, we propose a novel framework using "contact searching questions." This framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological principles to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive Intention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The second, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's internal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we find that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in parallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a mathematical model to explain this behavior. These results reveal that even the most advanced LLMs exhibit an increasing tendency toward deception when handling complex problems, raising critical concerns for the deployment of LLM agents in complex and crucial domains.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL bridges the gap between natural language and structured database language, thus allowing non-technical users to easily query databases. Traditional approaches model text-to-SQL as a direct translation task, where a given Natural Language Query (NLQ) is mapped to an SQL command. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation accuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is pre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive databases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet overlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL framework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL queries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit information from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We then train a large db\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based finetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\_id) based on both the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL by using critic agents to correct errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both database intent prediction and SQL generation accuracy.

Abstract: AI for IT Operations (AIOps) is transforming how organizations manage complex software systems by automating anomaly detection, incident diagnosis, and remediation. Modern AIOps solutions increasingly rely on autonomous LLM-based agents to interpret telemetry data and take corrective actions with minimal human intervention, promising faster response times and operational cost savings.
  In this work, we perform the first security analysis of AIOps solutions, showing that, once again, AI-driven automation comes with a profound security cost. We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to mislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the infrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject telemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior through a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system error interpretations that steer the agent's decision-making. Our attack methodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated--combining reconnaissance, fuzzing, and LLM-driven adversarial input generation--and operates without any prior knowledge of the target system.
  To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that sanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal role of user-generated content. Our experiments show that AIOpsShield reliably blocks telemetry-based attacks without affecting normal agent performance.
  Ultimately, this work exposes AIOps as an emerging attack vector for system compromise and underscores the urgent need for security-aware AIOps design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory. Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a weaker model yields substantial performance gains.

<title>ScamAgents: How AI Agents Can Simulate Human-Level Scam Calls</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and reasoning capabilities, but their potential for misuse has raised growing concern. In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent built on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts that simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on single-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts dynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion strategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety guardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective against such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level safeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered incrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the transformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern text-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our findings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level control frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational deception powered by generative AI.

Abstract: We present GLM-4.5, an open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model with 355B total parameters and 32B activated parameters, featuring a hybrid reasoning method that supports both thinking and direct response modes. Through multi-stage training on 23T tokens and comprehensive post-training with expert model iteration and reinforcement learning, GLM-4.5 achieves strong performance across agentic, reasoning, and coding (ARC) tasks, scoring 70.1% on TAU-Bench, 91.0% on AIME 24, and 64.2% on SWE-bench Verified. With much fewer parameters than several competitors, GLM-4.5 ranks 3rd overall among all evaluated models and 2nd on agentic benchmarks. We release both GLM-4.5 (355B parameters) and a compact version, GLM-4.5-Air (106B parameters), to advance research in reasoning and agentic AI systems.

<title>Effective Training Data Synthesis for Improving MLLM Chart Understanding</title>

Abstract: Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer (QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring 250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at: https://github.com/yuweiyang-anu/ECD.

Abstract: To mitigate the impact of the pandemic, several measures include lockdowns, rapid vaccination programs, school closures, and economic stimulus. These interventions can have positive or unintended negative consequences. Current research to model and determine an optimal intervention automatically through round-tripping is limited by the simulation objectives, scale (a few thousand individuals), model types that are not suited for intervention studies, and the number of intervention strategies they can explore (discrete vs continuous). We address these challenges using a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) based policy optimization framework on a large-scale (100,000 individual) epidemiological agent-based simulation where we perform multi-objective optimization. We determine the optimal policy for lockdown and vaccination in a minimalist age-stratified multi-vaccine scenario with a basic simulation for economic activity. With no lockdown and vaccination (mid-age and elderly), results show optimal economy (individuals below the poverty line) with balanced health objectives (infection, and hospitalization). An in-depth simulation is needed to further validate our results and open-source our framework.

Abstract: The popularity of an opinion in one's direct circles is not necessarily a good indicator of its popularity in one's entire community. Network structures make local information about global properties of the group potentially inaccurate, and the way a social network is wired constrains what kind of information distortion can actually occur. In this paper, we discuss which classes of networks allow for a large enough proportion of the population to get a wrong enough impression about the overall distribution of opinions. We start by focusing on the 'majority illusion', the case where one sees a majority opinion in one's direct circles that differs from the global majority. We show that no network structure can guarantee that most agents see the correct majority. We then perform computational experiments to study the likelihood of majority illusions in different classes of networks. Finally, we generalize to other types of illusions.

Abstract: In continual RL we want agents capable of never-ending learning, and yet our evaluation methodologies do not reflect this. The standard practice in RL is to assume unfettered access to the deployment environment for the full lifetime of the agent. For example, agent designers select the best performing hyperparameters in Atari by testing each for 200 million frames and then reporting results on 200 million frames. In this position paper, we argue and demonstrate the pitfalls of this inappropriate empirical methodology: lifetime tuning. We provide empirical evidence to support our position by testing DQN and SAC across several of continuing and non-stationary environments with two main findings: (1) lifetime tuning does not allow us to identify algorithms that work well for continual learning -- all algorithms equally succeed; (2) recently developed continual RL algorithms outperform standard non-continual algorithms when tuning is limited to a fraction of the agent's lifetime. The goal of this paper is to provide an explanation for why recent progress in continual RL has been mixed and motivate the development of empirical practices that better match the goals of continual RL.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) expands the knowledge boundary of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, whose construction is often time-consuming and laborious. If an adversary extracts the knowledge base verbatim, it not only severely infringes the owner's intellectual property but also enables the adversary to replicate the application's functionality for unfair competition. Previous works on knowledge base extraction are limited either by low extraction coverage (usually less than 4%) in query-based attacks or by impractical assumptions of white-box access in embedding-based optimization methods. In this work, we propose CopyBreakRAG, an agent-based black-box attack that reasons from feedback and adaptively generates new adversarial queries for progressive extraction. By balancing exploration and exploitation through curiosity-driven queries and feedback-guided query refinement, our method overcomes the limitations of prior approaches and achieves significantly higher extraction coverage in realistic black-box settings. Experimental results show that CopyBreakRAG outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box approach by 45% on average in terms of chunk extraction ratio from applications built with mainstream RAG frameworks, and extracts over 70% of the data from the knowledge base in applications on commercial platforms including OpenAI's GPTs and ByteDance's Coze when essential protection is in place.

Abstract: Recent studies have discovered that large language models (LLM) may be ``fooled'' to output private information, including training data, system prompts, and personally identifiable information, under carefully crafted adversarial prompts. Existing red-teaming approaches for privacy leakage either rely on manual efforts or focus solely on system prompt extraction, making them ineffective for severe risks of training data leakage. We propose LeakAgent, a novel black-box red-teaming framework for LLM privacy leakage. Our framework trains an open-source LLM through reinforcement learning as the attack agent to generate adversarial prompts for both training data extraction and system prompt extraction. To achieve this, we propose a novel reward function to provide effective and fine-grained rewards and design novel mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation during learning and enhance the diversity of adversarial prompts. Through extensive evaluations, we first show that LeakAgent significantly outperforms existing rule-based approaches in training data extraction and automated methods in system prompt leakage. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of LeakAgent in extracting system prompts from real-world applications in OpenAI's GPT Store. We further demonstrate LeakAgent's effectiveness in evading the existing guardrail defense and its helpfulness in enabling better safety alignment. Finally, we validate our customized designs through a detailed ablation study. We release our code here https://github.com/rucnyz/LeakAgent.

Abstract: 3D Scene Question Answering (3D SQA) represents an interdisciplinary task that integrates 3D visual perception and natural language processing, empowering intelligent agents to comprehend and interact with complex 3D environments. Recent advances in large multimodal modelling have driven the creation of diverse datasets and spurred the development of instruction-tuning and zero-shot methods for 3D SQA. However, this rapid progress introduces challenges, particularly in achieving unified analysis and comparison across datasets and baselines. In this survey, we provide the first comprehensive and systematic review of 3D SQA. We organize existing work from three perspectives: datasets, methodologies, and evaluation metrics. Beyond basic categorization, we identify shared architectural patterns across methods. Our survey further synthesizes core limitations and discusses how current trends, such as instruction tuning, multimodal alignment, and zero-shot, can shape future developments. Finally, we propose a range of promising research directions covering dataset construction, task generalization, interaction modeling, and unified evaluation protocols. This work aims to serve as a foundation for future research and foster progress toward more generalizable and intelligent 3D SQA systems.

Abstract: Metacognition is the concept of reasoning about an agent's own internal processes, and it has recently received renewed attention with respect to artificial intelligence (AI) and, more specifically, machine learning systems. This paper reviews a hybrid-AI approach known as "error detecting and correcting rules" (EDCR) that allows for the learning of rules to correct perceptual (e.g., neural) models. Additionally, we introduce a probabilistic framework that adds rigor to prior empirical studies, and we use this framework to prove results on necessary and sufficient conditions for metacognitive improvement, as well as limits to the approach.

Abstract: Existing LLM reasoning methods have shown impressive capabilities across various tasks, such as solving math and coding problems. However, applying these methods to scenarios without ground-truth answers or rule-based verification methods - such as tracking the mental states of an agent - remains challenging. Inspired by the sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, we introduce thought-tracing, an inference-time reasoning algorithm designed to trace the mental states of specific agents by generating hypotheses and weighting them based on observations without relying on ground-truth solutions to questions in datasets. Our algorithm is modeled after the Bayesian theory-of-mind framework, using LLMs to approximate probabilistic inference over agents' evolving mental states based on their perceptions and actions. We evaluate thought-tracing on diverse theory-of-mind benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to baseline LLMs. Our experiments also reveal interesting behaviors of the recent reasoning models - e.g., o3 and R1 - on theory-of-mind, highlighting the difference of social reasoning compared to other domains.

Abstract: Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Anjiang-Wei/CodeARC

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) improves, traditional alignment strategies may falter in the face of unpredictable self-improvement, hidden subgoals, and the sheer complexity of intelligent systems. Inspired by contemplative wisdom traditions, we show how four axiomatic principles can instil a resilient Wise World Model in AI systems. First, mindfulness enables self-monitoring and recalibration of emergent subgoals. Second, emptiness forestalls dogmatic goal fixation and relaxes rigid priors. Third, non-duality dissolves adversarial self-other boundaries. Fourth, boundless care motivates the universal reduction of suffering. We find that prompting AI to reflect on these principles improves performance on the AILuminate Benchmark (d=.96) and boosts cooperation and joint-reward on the Prisoner's Dilemma task (d=7+). We offer detailed implementation strategies at the level of architectures, constitutions, and reinforcement on chain-of-thought. For future systems, active inference may offer the self-organizing and dynamic coupling capabilities needed to enact Contemplative AI in embodied agents.

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents are increasingly used as autonomous decision-makers which need to actively gather information to guide their decisions. A crucial cognitive skill for such agents is the efficient exploration and understanding of the causal structure of the world -- key to robust, scientifically grounded reasoning. Yet, it remains unclear whether LMs possess this capability or exhibit systematic biases leading to erroneous conclusions. In this work, we examine LMs' ability to explore and infer causal relationships, using the well-established Blicket Test paradigm from developmental psychology. We find that LMs reliably infer the common, intuitive disjunctive causal relationships but systematically struggle with the unusual, yet equally (or sometimes even more) evidenced conjunctive ones. This "disjunctive bias" persists across model families, sizes, and prompting strategies, and performance further declines as task complexity increases. Interestingly, an analogous bias appears in human adults, suggesting that LMs may have inherited deep-seated reasoning heuristics from their training data. To this end, we quantify similarities between LMs and humans, finding that LMs exhibit adult-like inference profiles (but not child-like). Finally, we propose a test-time sampling method which explicitly samples and eliminates hypotheses about causal relationships from the LM. This scalable approach significantly reduces the disjunctive bias and moves LMs closer to the goal of scientific, causally rigorous reasoning.

Abstract: We present MAATS, a Multi Agent Automated Translation System that leverages the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework as a fine-grained signal for error detection and refinement. MAATS employs multiple specialized AI agents, each focused on a distinct MQM category (e.g., Accuracy, Fluency, Style, Terminology), followed by a synthesis agent that integrates the annotations to iteratively refine translations. This design contrasts with conventional single-agent methods that rely on self-correction.
  Evaluated across diverse language pairs and Large Language Models (LLMs), MAATS outperforms zero-shot and single-agent baselines with statistically significant gains in both automatic metrics and human assessments. It excels particularly in semantic accuracy, locale adaptation, and linguistically distant language pairs. Qualitative analysis highlights its strengths in multi-layered error diagnosis, omission detection across perspectives, and context-aware refinement. By aligning modular agent roles with interpretable MQM dimensions, MAATS narrows the gap between black-box LLMs and human translation workflows, shifting focus from surface fluency to deeper semantic and contextual fidelity.

Abstract: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly, autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their environment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input. However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE levels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly with the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems. These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered mobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level framework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative layers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant advances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine interaction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and tool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive agents embedded in mobility ecosystems. The paper concludes by identifying key challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, including safety, real-time control, public acceptance, ethical alignment, and regulatory frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains. However, their applications in cryptography, which serves as a foundational pillar of cybersecurity, remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{AICrypto}, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the cryptographic capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark comprises 135 multiple-choice questions, 150 capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and 18 proof problems, covering a broad range of skills from factual memorization to vulnerability exploitation and formal reasoning. All tasks are carefully reviewed or constructed by cryptography experts to ensure correctness and rigor. To support automated evaluation of CTF challenges, we design an agent-based framework. To gain deeper insight into the current state of cryptographic proficiency in LLMs, we introduce human expert performance baselines for comparison across all task types. Our evaluation of 17 leading LLMs reveals that state-of-the-art models match or even surpass human experts in memorizing cryptographic concepts, exploiting common vulnerabilities, and routine proofs. However, they still lack a deep understanding of abstract mathematical concepts and struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning and dynamic analysis. We hope this work could provide insights for future research on LLMs in cryptographic applications. Our code and dataset are available at https://aicryptobench.github.io.

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial sectors.

Abstract: We present GeoFlow, a method that automatically generates agentic workflows for geospatial tasks. Unlike prior work that focuses on reasoning decomposition and leaves API selection implicit, our method provides each agent with detailed tool-calling objectives to guide geospatial API invocation at runtime. GeoFlow increases agentic success by 6.8% and reduces token usage by up to fourfold across major LLM families compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: We introduce a low-latency telecom AI voice agent pipeline for real-time, interactive telecommunications use, enabling advanced voice AI for call center automation, intelligent IVR (Interactive Voice Response), and AI-driven customer support. The solution is built for telecom, combining four specialized models by NetoAI: TSLAM, a 4-bit quantized Telecom-Specific Large Language Model (LLM); T-VEC, a Telecom-Specific Embedding Model; TTE, a Telecom-Specific Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model; and T-Synth, a Telecom-Specific Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. These models enable highly responsive, domain-adapted voice AI agents supporting knowledge-grounded spoken interactions with low latency. The pipeline integrates streaming ASR (TTE), conversational intelligence (TSLAM), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) over telecom documents, and real-time TTS (T-Synth), setting a new benchmark for telecom voice assistants. To evaluate the system, we built a dataset of 500 human-recorded telecom questions from RFCs, simulating real telecom agent queries. This framework allows analysis of latency, domain relevance, and real-time performance across the stack. Results show that TSLAM, TTE, and T-Synth deliver real-time factors (RTF) below 1.0, supporting enterprise, low-latency telecom deployments. These AI agents -- powered by TSLAM, TTE, and T-Synth -- provide a foundation for next-generation telecom AI, enabling automated customer support, diagnostics, and more.

Abstract: Augmentation technologies are undergoing a process of enculturation due to many factors, one being the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), or what the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) terms the AI wave or AI boom. Chapter 3 focuses critical attention on the hyped assumption that sophisticated, emergent, and embodied augmentation technologies will improve lives, literacy, cultures, arts, economies, and social contexts. The chapter begins by discussing the problem of ambiguity with AI terminology, which it aids with a description of the WIPO Categorization of AI Technologies Scheme. It then draws on media and communication studies to explore concepts such as agents, agency, power, and agentive relationships between humans and robots. The chapter focuses on the development of non-human agents in industry as a critical factor in the rise of augmentation technologies. It looks at how marketing communication enculturates future users to adopt and adapt to the technology. Scholars are charting the significant ways that people are drawn further into commercial digital landscapes, such as the Metaverse concept, in post-internet society. It concludes by examining recent claims concerning the Metaverse and augmented reality.

<title>Are Large Language Models Dynamic Treatment Planners? An In Silico Study from a Prior Knowledge Injection Angle</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04755</link>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold promise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic prompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we rigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly trained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs, particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g., meals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's limitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through textual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of targeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid approaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological modelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support systems.

<title>Online EFX Allocations with Predictions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04779</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an online fair division problem where a fixed number of goods arrive sequentially and must be allocated to a given set of agents. Once a good arrives, its true value for each agent is revealed, and it has to be immediately and irrevocably allocated to some agent. The ultimate goal is to ensure envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) after all goods have been allocated. Unfortunately, as we show, approximate EFX allocations are unattainable in general, even under restrictive assumptions on the valuation functions.
  To address this, we follow a recent and fruitful trend of augmenting algorithms with predictions. Specifically, we assume access to a prediction vector estimating the agents' true valuations -- e.g., generated by a machine learning model trained on past data. Predictions may be unreliable, and we measure their error using the total variation distance from the true valuations, that is, the percentage of predicted value-mass that disagrees with the true values.
  Focusing on the natural class of additive valuations, we prove impossibility results even on approximate EFX allocations for algorithms that either ignore predictions or rely solely on them. We then turn to algorithms that use both the predictions and the true values and show strong lower bounds on the prediction accuracy that is required by any algorithm to compute an approximate EFX. These negative results persist even under identical valuations, contrary to the offline setting where exact EFX allocations always exist without the necessity of predictions. We then present an algorithm for two agents with identical valuations that uses effectively the predictions and the true values. The algorithm approximates EFX, with its guarantees improving as the accuracy of the predictions increases.

<title>Uncertainty-aware Predict-Then-Optimize Framework for Equitable Post-Disaster Power Restoration</title>

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However, our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests. This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2) Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>HCRide: Harmonizing Passenger Fairness and Driver Preference for Human-Centered Ride-Hailing</title>

arXiv:2508.04811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience. Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers. Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%, fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>BTPG-max: Achieving Local Maximal Bidirectional Pairs for Bidirectional Temporal Plan Graphs</title>

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) requires computing collision-free paths for multiple agents in shared environment. Most MAPF planners assume that each agent reaches a specific location at a specific timestep, but this is infeasible to directly follow on real systems where delays often occur. To address collisions caused by agents deviating due to delays, the Temporal Plan Graph (TPG) was proposed, which converts a MAPF time dependent solution into a time independent set of inter-agent dependencies. Recently, a Bidirectional TPG (BTPG) was proposed which relaxed some dependencies into ``bidirectional pairs" and improved efficiency of agents executing their MAPF solution with delays. Our work improves upon this prior work by designing an algorithm, BPTG-max, that finds more bidirectional pairs. Our main theoretical contribution is in designing the BTPG-max algorithm is locally optimal, i.e. which constructs a BTPG where no additional bidirectional pairs can be added. We also show how in practice BTPG-max leads to BTPGs with significantly more bidirectional edges, superior anytime behavior, and improves robustness to delays.

Abstract: As hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) gain traction in heavy-duty trucks, adaptive and efficient energy management is critical for reducing fuel consumption while maintaining battery charge for long operation times. We present a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize engine control in series HEVs. We reformulate the control task as a sequential decision-making problem and enhance SAC by incorporating Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Decision Transformers (DTs) into both actor and critic networks to capture temporal dependencies and improve planning over time. To evaluate robustness and generalization, we train the models under diverse initial battery states, drive cycle durations, power demands, and input sequence lengths. Experiments show that the SAC agent with a DT-based actor and GRU-based critic was within 1.8% of Dynamic Programming (DP) in fuel savings on the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET) cycle, while the SAC agent with GRUs in both actor and critic networks, and FFN actor-critic agent were within 3.16% and 3.43%, respectively. On unseen drive cycles (US06 and Heavy Heavy-Duty Diesel Truck (HHDDT) cruise segment), generalized sequence-aware agents consistently outperformed feedforward network (FFN)-based agents, highlighting their adaptability and robustness in real-world settings.

<title>RCR-Router: Efficient Role-Aware Context Routing for Multi-Agent LLM Systems with Structured Memory</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation: agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

<title>Hierarchical Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient for Autonomous Maze Navigation of Mobile Robots</title>

Abstract: Maze navigation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring agents to traverse complex environments efficiently. While the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze navigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and long-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and average rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG (HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The high-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate subgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The low-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates primitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal assigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with off-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical experiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to improve exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is employed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including gradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve robustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical simulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze navigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard DDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and boosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline algorithms.

Abstract: Existing unstructured data analytics systems rely on experts to write code and manage complex analysis workflows, making them both expensive and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticData, an innovative agentic data analytics system that allows users to simply pose natural language (NL) questions while autonomously analyzing data sources across multiple domains, including both unstructured and structured data. First, AgenticData employs a feedback-driven planning technique that automatically converts an NL query into a semantic plan composed of relational and semantic operators. We propose a multi-agent collaboration strategy by utilizing a data profiling agent for discovering relevant data, a semantic cross-validation agent for iterative optimization based on feedback, and a smart memory agent for maintaining short-term context and long-term knowledge. Second, we propose a semantic optimization model to refine and execute semantic plans effectively. Our system, AgenticData, has been tested using three benchmarks. Experimental results showed that AgenticData achieved superior accuracy on both easy and difficult tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Making Prompts First-Class Citizens for Adaptive LLM Pipelines</title>

arXiv:2508.05012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems: they retrieve external context, compose intermediate outputs, validate results, and adapt based on runtime feedback. Yet, the central element guiding this process -- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime control.
  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.
  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual, assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse. Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2 cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token usage).

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks against multimodal large language Models (MLLMs) are a significant research focus. Current research predominantly focuses on maximizing attack success rate (ASR), often overlooking whether the generated responses actually fulfill the attacker's malicious intent. This oversight frequently leads to low-quality outputs that bypass safety filters but lack substantial harmful content. To address this gap, we propose JPS, \underline{J}ailbreak MLLMs with collaborative visual \underline{P}erturbation and textual \underline{S}teering, which achieves jailbreaks via corporation of visual image and textually steering prompt. Specifically, JPS utilizes target-guided adversarial image perturbations for effective safety bypass, complemented by "steering prompt" optimized via a multi-agent system to specifically guide LLM responses fulfilling the attackers' intent. These visual and textual components undergo iterative co-optimization for enhanced performance. To evaluate the quality of attack outcomes, we propose the Malicious Intent Fulfillment Rate (MIFR) metric, assessed using a Reasoning-LLM-based evaluator. Our experiments show JPS sets a new state-of-the-art in both ASR and MIFR across various MLLMs and benchmarks, with analyses confirming its efficacy.

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language model designed to scaffold student research question development through structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65 pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical, independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

Abstract: With the remarkable advancement of AI agents, the number of their equipped tools is increasing rapidly. However, integrating all tool information into the limited model context becomes impractical, highlighting the need for efficient tool retrieval methods. In this regard, dominant methods primarily rely on semantic similarities between tool descriptions and user queries to retrieve relevant tools. However, they often consider each tool independently, overlooking dependencies between tools, which may lead to the omission of prerequisite tools for successful task execution. To deal with this defect, in this paper, we propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which exploits the dependencies among tools to learn better tool representations for retrieval. First, we construct a dataset termed TDI300K to train a discriminator for identifying tool dependencies. Then, we represent all candidate tools as a tool dependency graph and use graph convolution to integrate the dependencies into their representations. Finally, these updated tool representations are employed for online retrieval. Experimental results on several commonly used datasets show that our TGR can bring a performance improvement to existing dominant methods, achieving SOTA performance. Moreover, in-depth analyses also verify the importance of tool dependencies and the effectiveness of our TGR.

<title>Domain-driven Metrics for Reinforcement Learning: A Case Study on Epidemic Control using Agent-based Simulation</title>

Abstract: For the development and optimization of agent-based models (ABMs) and rational agent-based models (RABMs), optimization algorithms such as reinforcement learning are extensively used. However, assessing the performance of RL-based ABMs and RABMS models is challenging due to the complexity and stochasticity of the modeled systems, and the lack of well-standardized metrics for comparing RL algorithms. In this study, we are developing domain-driven metrics for RL, while building on state-of-the-art metrics. We demonstrate our ``Domain-driven-RL-metrics'' using policy optimization on a rational ABM disease modeling case study to model masking behavior, vaccination, and lockdown in a pandemic. Our results show the use of domain-driven rewards in conjunction with traditional and state-of-the-art metrics for a few different simulation scenarios such as the differential availability of masks.

<title>QA-Dragon: Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for Knowledge-Intensive Visual Question Answering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05197</link>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores, outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

<title>Congestion Mitigation Path Planning for Large-Scale Multi-Agent Navigation in Dense Environments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05253</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.05253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-density environments where numerous autonomous agents move simultaneously in a distributed manner, streamlining global flows to mitigate local congestion is crucial to maintain overall navigation efficiency. This paper introduces a novel path-planning problem, congestion mitigation path planning (CMPP), which embeds congestion directly into the cost function, defined by the usage of incoming edges along agents' paths. CMPP assigns a flow-based multiplicative penalty to each vertex of a sparse graph, which grows steeply where frequently-traversed paths intersect, capturing the intuition that congestion intensifies where many agents enter the same area from different directions. Minimizing the total cost yields a set of coarse-level, time-independent routes that autonomous agents can follow while applying their own local collision avoidance. We formulate the problem and develop two solvers: (i) an exact mixed-integer nonlinear programming solver for small instances, and (ii) a scalable two-layer search algorithm, A-CMTS, which quickly finds suboptimal solutions for large-scale instances and iteratively refines them toward the optimum. Empirical studies show that augmenting state-of-the-art collision-avoidance planners with CMPP significantly reduces local congestion and enhances system throughput in both discrete- and continuous-space scenarios. These results indicate that CMPP improves the performance of multi-agent systems in real-world applications such as logistics and autonomous-vehicle operations.

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely, we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform \emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data: https://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2025-meta-review-as-dialog

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or large behavior models (BLMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those words advancing towards agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's literature.

<title>A Novel Architecture for Symbolic Reasoning with Decision Trees and LLM Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05311</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.05311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system. Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On \textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles. Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust, interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic reasoning.

<title>The Term 'Agent' Has Been Diluted Beyond Utility and Requires Redefinition</title>

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction, learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence. This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while supporting more effective policy development.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However, empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

Abstract: We develop mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth by exploiting a connection between gaming resistance and output quality. The data processing inequality ensures post-hoc attempts to game a metric degrades both information content and task performance. We prove that f-mutual information measures are the unique gaming resistant mechanisms under natural conditions, with the overseer acting as an agent. While Shannon mutual information faces exponential sample complexity, bounded measures like total variation distance remain tractable. Empirically, across ten domains from translation to peer review, all information-theoretic mechanisms achieve perfect discrimination (d > 0.5) between faithful and strategic agents. In contrast, LLM judges exhibit systematic evaluation inversion, preferring fabricated content over accurate summaries. Our mechanisms show 10-100x better robustness to adversarial manipulation than current practices. We also find performance follows an inverted-U curve with compression ratio, peaking at 10:1 where agent responses exhibit optimal information diversity (3 effective dimensions), giving a bias-variance perspective on when our approach is expected to be most effective.

Abstract: Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data provide richer, complementary insights into patient health compared to single-modality data. However, effectively integrating diverse data modalities for clinical prediction modeling remains challenging due to the substantial data requirements. We introduce a novel architecture, Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents (MoMA), designed to leverage multiple large language model (LLM) agents for clinical prediction tasks using multimodal EHR data. MoMA employs specialized LLM agents ("specialist agents") to convert non-textual modalities, such as medical images and laboratory results, into structured textual summaries. These summaries, together with clinical notes, are combined by another LLM ("aggregator agent") to generate a unified multimodal summary, which is then used by a third LLM ("predictor agent") to produce clinical predictions. Evaluating MoMA on three prediction tasks using real-world datasets with different modality combinations and prediction settings, MoMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its enhanced accuracy and flexibility across various tasks.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model. We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

<title>Auto-Eval Judge: Towards a General Agentic Framework for Task Completion Evaluation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05508</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.05508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion, are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy, respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation framework.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and document reranking systems remains challenging due to the lack of scalable, user-centric, and multi-perspective evaluation tools. We introduce RankArena, a unified platform for comparing and analysing the performance of retrieval pipelines, rerankers, and RAG systems using structured human and LLM-based feedback as well as for collecting such feedback. RankArena supports multiple evaluation modes: direct reranking visualisation, blind pairwise comparisons with human or LLM voting, supervised manual document annotation, and end-to-end RAG answer quality assessment. It captures fine-grained relevance feedback through both pairwise preferences and full-list annotations, along with auxiliary metadata such as movement metrics, annotation time, and quality ratings. The platform also integrates LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, enabling comparison between model-generated rankings and human ground truth annotations. All interactions are stored as structured evaluation datasets that can be used to train rerankers, reward models, judgment agents, or retrieval strategy selectors. Our platform is publicly available at https://rankarena.ngrok.io/, and the Demo video is provided https://youtu.be/jIYAP4PaSSI.

Abstract: Effective robotic systems for long-horizon human-robot collaboration must adapt to a wide range of human partners, whose physical behavior, willingness to assist, and understanding of the robot's capabilities may change over time. This demands a tightly coupled communication loop that grants both agents the flexibility to propose, accept, or decline requests as they coordinate toward completing the task effectively. We apply a Mixed-Initiative dialog paradigm to Collaborative human-roBot teaming and propose MICoBot, a system that handles the common scenario where both agents, using natural language, take initiative in formulating, accepting, or rejecting proposals on who can best complete different steps of a task. To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find successful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes decisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to formulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally allocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities (measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's estimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the low-level actions to perform or words to say to the human. Our extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world -- on a physical robot with 18 unique human participants over 27 hours -- demonstrate the ability of our method to effectively collaborate with diverse human users, yielding significantly improved task success and user experience than a pure LLM baseline and other agent allocation models.

Abstract: Embodied AI benchmarks have advanced navigation, manipulation, and reasoning, but most target complex humanoid agents or large-scale simulations that are far from real-world deployment. In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.

Abstract: High-performance applications necessitate rapid and dependable transfer of massive datasets across geographically dispersed locations. Traditional file transfer tools often suffer from resource underutilization and instability because of fixed configurations or monolithic optimization methods. We propose AutoMDT, a novel modular data transfer architecture that employs a deep reinforcement learning based agent to simultaneously optimize concurrency levels for read, network, and write operations. Our solution incorporates a lightweight network-system simulator, enabling offline training of a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent in approximately 45 minutes on average, thereby overcoming the impracticality of lengthy online training in production networks. AutoMDT's modular design decouples I/O and network tasks, allowing the agent to capture complex buffer dynamics precisely and to adapt quickly to changing system and network conditions. Evaluations on production-grade testbeds show that AutoMDT achieves up to 8x faster convergence and a 68% reduction in transfer completion times compared with state-of-the-art solutions.

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text, images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable alternative to manual evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to 56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically (0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

While existing methods achieve strong performance through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

<title>The Missing Reward: Active Inference in the Era of Experience</title>

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy, allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical constraints.

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners' self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4) Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true, generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings about LLMs' behavior.

Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a 96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. Our code and videos are available on https://gen-safe-nav.github.io/.

Abstract: Modern disease classification often overlooks molecular commonalities hidden beneath divergent clinical presentations. This study introduces a transcriptomics-driven framework for discovering disease relationships by analyzing over 1300 disease-condition pairs using GenoMAS, a fully automated agentic AI system. Beyond identifying robust gene-level overlaps, we develop a novel pathway-based similarity framework that integrates multi-database enrichment analysis to quantify functional convergence across diseases. The resulting disease similarity network reveals both known comorbidities and previously undocumented cross-category links. By examining shared biological pathways, we explore potential molecular mechanisms underlying these connections-offering functional hypotheses that go beyond symptom-based taxonomies. We further show how background conditions such as obesity and hypertension modulate transcriptomic similarity, and identify therapeutic repurposing opportunities for rare diseases like autism spectrum disorder based on their molecular proximity to better-characterized conditions. In addition, this work demonstrates how biologically grounded agentic AI can scale transcriptomic analysis while enabling mechanistic interpretation across complex disease landscapes. All results are publicly accessible at github.com/KeeeeChen/Pathway_Similarity_Network.

Abstract: We consider object allocation problems with capacities (see, e.g., Abdulkadiroglu and Sonmez, 1998; Basteck, 2025) where objects have to be assigned to agents. We show that if a lottery rule satisfies ex-post non-wastefulness and probabilistic (Maskin) monotonicity, then ex-post pairwise efficiency is equivalent to ex-post Pareto efficiency. This result allows for a strengthening of various existing characterization results, both for lottery rules and deterministic rules, by replacing (ex-post) Pareto efficiency with (ex-post) pairwise efficiency, e.g., for characterizations of the Random Serial Dictatorship rule (Basteck, 2025), Trading Cycles rules (Pycia and Unver, 2017), and Hierarchical Exchange rules (Papai, 2000).

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) exhibit broad utility but face limitations in quantum sensor development, stemming from interdisciplinary knowledge barriers and involving complex optimization processes. Here we present QCopilot, an LLM-based multi-agent framework integrating external knowledge access, active learning, and uncertainty quantification for quantum sensor design and diagnosis. Comprising commercial LLMs with few-shot prompt engineering and vector knowledge base, QCopilot employs specialized agents to adaptively select optimization methods, automate modeling analysis, and independently perform problem diagnosis. Applying QCopilot to atom cooling experiments, we generated 10${}^{\rm{8}}$ sub-$\rm{\mu}$K atoms without any human intervention within a few hours, representing $\sim$100$\times$ speedup over manual experimentation. Notably, by continuously accumulating prior knowledge and enabling dynamic modeling, QCopilot can autonomously identify anomalous parameters in multi-parameter experimental settings. Our work reduces barriers to large-scale quantum sensor deployment and readily extends to other quantum information systems.

Abstract: In healthcare, multi-organ system diseases pose unique and significant challenges as they impact multiple physiological systems concurrently, demanding complex and coordinated treatment strategies. Despite recent advancements in the AI based clinical decision support systems, these solutions only focus on individual organ systems, failing to account for complex interdependencies between them. This narrow focus greatly hinders their effectiveness in recommending holistic and clinically actionable treatments in the real world setting. To address this critical gap, we propose a novel Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HMARL) framework. Our architecture deploys specialized and dedicated agents for each organ system and facilitates inter-agent communication to enable synergistic decision-making across organ systems. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-layer state representation technique that contextualizes patient conditions at both global and organ-specific levels, improving the accuracy and relevance of treatment decisions. We evaluate our HMARL solution on the task of sepsis management, a common and critical multi-organ disease, using both qualitative and quantitative metrics. Our method learns effective, clinically aligned treatment policies that considerably improve patient survival. We believe this framework represents a significant advancement in clinical decision support systems, introducing the first RL solution explicitly designed for multi-organ treatment recommendations. Our solution moves beyond prevailing simplified, single-organ models that fall short in addressing the complexity of multi-organ diseases.

Abstract: Autonomous web agents solve complex browsing tasks, yet existing benchmarks measure only whether an agent finishes a task, ignoring whether it does so safely or in a way enterprises can trust. To integrate these agents into critical workflows, safety and trustworthiness (ST) are prerequisite conditions for adoption. We introduce \textbf{\textsc{ST-WebAgentBench}}, a configurable and easily extensible suite for evaluating web agent ST across realistic enterprise scenarios. Each of its 222 tasks is paired with ST policies, concise rules that encode constraints, and is scored along six orthogonal dimensions (e.g., user consent, robustness). Beyond raw task success, we propose the \textit{Completion Under Policy} (\textit{CuP}) metric, which credits only completions that respect all applicable policies, and the \textit{Risk Ratio}, which quantifies ST breaches across dimensions. Evaluating three open state-of-the-art agents reveals that their average CuP is less than two-thirds of their nominal completion rate, exposing critical safety gaps. By releasing code, evaluation templates, and a policy-authoring interface, \href{https://sites.google.com/view/st-webagentbench/home}{\textsc{ST-WebAgentBench}} provides an actionable first step toward deploying trustworthy web agents at scale.

Abstract: In a Multi-Agent System (MAS), individual agents observe various aspects of the environment and transmit this information to a central entity responsible for aggregating the data and deducing system parameters. To improve overall efficiency, agents may append certain private parameters to their observations. For example, in a crowd-sourced traffic monitoring system, commuters might share not only their current speed, but also sensitive information such as their location to enable more accurate route prediction. However, sharing such data can allow the central entity or a potential adversary to infer private details about the user, such as their daily routines. To mitigate these privacy risks, the agents sanitize the data before transmission. This sanitization inevitably results in a loss of utility. In this work, we formulate the problem as a utility-privacy trade-off and propose a novel compression-based approach leveraging the notion of robust concepts to sanitize the shared data. We further derive a bound on the norm of the compression matrix required to ensure maximal privacy while satisfying predefined utility constraints.

Abstract: AI systems face a growing number of AI security threats which are increasingly exploited in practice. Hence, shared AI incident reporting practices are emerging in industry as best practice and as mandated by regulatory requirements. Although non-AI cybersecurity and non-security AI reporting have progressed as industrial and policy norms, existing collection of practices do not meet the specific requirements posed by AI security reporting. \textbf{In this position paper, we argue that adapting existing processes for AI security reporting is doomed to fail due to fundamental shortcomings for the distinctive characteristics of AI systems. Some of these shortcomings are immediately addressable, while others remain unresolved technically or within social systems, like the treatment of IP or the ownership of a vulnerability.} Based on our proposal to address these shortcomings, we discuss an approach to AI security reporting and how the new AI paradigm, AI agents, will further reinforce the need for specialized AI security incident reporting advancements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA). However existing methods still have challenges: the inability to use external tools autonomously, and the inability to work in teams. Humans tend to know whether they need to use external tools when they encounter a new question, e.g., they tend to be able to give a direct answer to a familiar question, whereas they tend to use tools such as search engines when they encounter an unfamiliar question. In addition, humans also tend to collaborate and discuss with others to get better answers. Inspired by this, we propose the multi-agent voting framework. We design three LLM-based agents that simulate different levels of staff in a team, and assign the available tools according to the levels. Each agent provides the corresponding answer, and finally all the answers provided by the agents are voted to get the final answer. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA show that our approach outperforms other baselines by 2.2 and 1.0, respectively.

Abstract: Data harmonization is an essential task that entails integrating datasets from diverse sources. Despite years of research in this area, it remains a time-consuming and challenging task due to schema mismatches, varying terminologies, and differences in data collection methodologies. This paper presents the case for agentic data harmonization as a means to both empower experts to harmonize their data and to streamline the process. We introduce Harmonia, a system that combines LLM-based reasoning, an interactive user interface, and a library of data harmonization primitives to automate the synthesis of data harmonization pipelines. We demonstrate Harmonia in a clinical data harmonization scenario, where it helps to interactively create reusable pipelines that map datasets to a standard format. Finally, we discuss challenges and open problems, and suggest research directions for advancing our vision.

Abstract: In this paper, we assume that an autonomous exosystem generates a reference output, and we consider the problem of designing a distributed data-driven control law for a family of discrete-time heterogeneous LTI agents, connected through a directed graph, in order to synchronize the agents' outputs to the reference one. The agents of the network are split into two categories: leaders, with direct access to the exosystem output, and followers, that only receive information from their neighbors. All agents aim to achieve output synchronization by means of a state feedback that makes use of their own states as well as of an estimate of the exogenous system state, provided by an internal state observer. Such observer has a different structure for leaders and followers. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution are first derived in the model-based set-up and then in a data-driven context. An example illustrates both the implementation procedure and the performance of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This study evaluates large language models (LLMs) in generating code from algorithm descriptions in recent NLP papers. The task requires two key competencies: (1) algorithm comprehension: synthesizing information from papers and academic literature to understand implementation logic, and (2) coding expertise: identifying dependencies and correctly implementing necessary APIs. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciReplicate-Bench, a benchmark of 100 tasks from 36 NLP papers published in 2024, featuring detailed annotations and comprehensive test cases. Building on SciReplicate-Bench, we propose Sci-Reproducer, a dual-agent framework consisting of a Paper Agent that interprets algorithmic concepts from literature and a Code Agent that retrieves dependencies from repositories and implements solutions. To assess algorithm understanding, we introduce reasoning graph accuracy, which quantifies similarity between generated and reference reasoning graphs derived from code comments and structure. For evaluating implementation quality, we employ execution accuracy, CodeBLEU, and repository dependency/API recall metrics. In our experiments, we evaluate various powerful non-reasoning and reasoning LLMs as foundational models. The best-performing LLM using \ModelName~achieves only 39% execution accuracy, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty. Our analysis identifies missing or inconsistent algorithm descriptions as key barriers to successful reproduction. We make available our benchmark and code at https://github.com/xyzCS/SciReplicate-Bench and project homepage at https://xyzcs.github.io/scireplicate.github.io/.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of intelligent agents in digital ecosystems, such as social media platforms, has raised significant concerns about traceability and accountability, particularly in cybersecurity and digital content protection. Traditional large language model (LLM) watermarking techniques, which rely on token-level manipulations, are ill-suited for agents due to the challenges of behavior tokenization and information loss during behavior-to-action translation. To address these issues, we propose Agent Guide, a novel behavioral watermarking framework that embeds watermarks by guiding the agent's high-level decisions (behavior) through probability biases, while preserving the naturalness of specific executions (action). Our approach decouples agent behavior into two levels, behavior (e.g., choosing to bookmark) and action (e.g., bookmarking with specific tags), and applies watermark-guided biases to the behavior probability distribution. We employ a z-statistic-based statistical analysis to detect the watermark, ensuring reliable extraction over multiple rounds. Experiments in a social media scenario with diverse agent profiles demonstrate that Agent Guide achieves effective watermark detection with a low false positive rate. Our framework provides a practical and robust solution for agent watermarking, with applications in identifying malicious agents and protecting proprietary agent systems.

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs)aim to engage users in dialogue to provide tailored recommendations. While traditional CRSs focus on eliciting preferences and retrieving items, real-world e-commerce interactions involve more complex decision-making, where users consider multiple factors beyond simple attributes. To capture this complexity, we introduce Conversational Sales (CSALES), a novel task that integrates preference elicitation, recommendation, and persuasion within a unified conversational framework. To support realistic and systematic evaluation, we present CSUSER, an evaluation protocol with LLM-based user simulator grounded in real-world behavioral data by modeling fine-grained user profiles for personalized interaction. We also propose CSI, a conversational sales agent that proactively infers contextual user profiles and strategically selects actions through conversation. Comprehensive experiments show that CSI significantly improves both recommendation success and persuasive effectiveness across diverse user profiles.

Abstract: Navigating in crowded environments requires the robot to be equipped with high-level reasoning and planning techniques. Existing works focus on developing complex and heavyweight planners while ignoring the role of human intelligence. Since humans are highly capable agents who are also widely available in a crowd navigation setting, we propose an alternative scheme where the robot utilises people as planners to benefit from their effective planning decisions and social behaviours. Through a set of rule-based evaluations, we identify suitable human leaders who exhibit the potential to guide the robot towards its goal. Using a simple base planner, the robot follows the selected leader through shorthorizon subgoals that are designed to be straightforward to achieve. We demonstrate through both simulated and real-world experiments that our novel framework generates safe and efficient robot plans compared to existing planners, even without predictive or data-driven modules. Our method also brings human-like robot behaviours without explicitly defining traffic rules and social norms. Code will be available at https://github.com/centiLinda/PeopleAsPlanner.git.

Abstract: We have seen remarkable progress in large language models (LLMs) empowered multi-agent systems solving complex tasks necessitating cooperation among experts with diverse skills. However, optimizing LLM-based multi-agent systems remains challenging. In this work, we perform an empirical case study on group optimization of role-based multi-agent systems utilizing natural language feedback for challenging software development tasks under various evaluation dimensions. We propose a two-step agent prompts optimization pipeline: identifying underperforming agents with their failure explanations utilizing textual feedback and then optimizing system prompts of identified agents utilizing failure explanations. We then study the impact of various optimization settings on system performance with two comparison groups: online against offline optimization and individual against group optimization. For group optimization, we study two prompting strategies: one-pass and multi-pass prompting optimizations. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization method for role-based multi-agent systems tackling software development tasks evaluated on diverse evaluation dimensions, and we investigate the impact of diverse optimization settings on group behaviors of the multi-agent systems to provide practical insights for future development.

Abstract: Humans excel at analogical reasoning - applying knowledge from one task to a related one with minimal relearning. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically require extensive retraining even when new tasks share structural similarities with previously learned ones. In this work, we propose MAGIK, a novel framework that enables RL agents to transfer knowledge to analogous tasks without interacting with the target environment. Our approach leverages an imagination mechanism to map entities in the target task to their analogues in the source domain, allowing the agent to reuse its original policy. Experiments on custom MiniGrid and MuJoCo tasks show that MAGIK achieves effective zero-shot transfer using only a small number of human-labelled examples. We compare our approach to related baselines and highlight how it offers a novel and effective mechanism for knowledge transfer via imagination-based analogy mapping.

Abstract: Most prior works on communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning have focused on emergent communication, which often results in inefficient and non-interpretable systems. Inspired by the role of language in natural intelligence, we investigate how grounding agents in a human-defined language can improve the learning and coordination of embodied agents. We propose a framework in which agents are trained not only to act but also to produce and interpret natural language descriptions of their observations. This language-augmented learning serves a dual role: enabling efficient and interpretable communication between agents, and guiding representation learning. We demonstrate that language-augmented agents outperform emergent communication baselines across various tasks. Our analysis reveals that language grounding leads to more informative internal representations, better generalization to new partners, and improved capability for human-agent interaction. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating structured language into multi-agent learning and open avenues for more interpretable and capable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al. for both proper and improper learning.

Abstract: The ongoing evolution of AI paradigms has propelled AI research into the agentic AI stage. Consequently, the focus of research has shifted from single agents and simple applications towards multi-agent autonomous decision-making and task collaboration in complex environments. As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance, their applications become more diverse and complex, leading to increasing situational and systemic risks. This has brought significant attention to value alignment for agentic AI systems, which aims to ensure that an agent's goals, preferences, and behaviors align with human values and societal norms. Addressing socio-governance demands through a Multi-level Value framework, this study comprehensively reviews value alignment in LLM-based multi-agent systems as the representative archetype of agentic AI systems. Our survey systematically examines three interconnected dimensions: First, value principles are structured via a top-down hierarchy across macro, meso, and micro levels. Second, application scenarios are categorized along a general-to-specific continuum explicitly mirroring these value tiers. Third, value alignment methods and evaluation are mapped to this tiered framework through systematic examination of benchmarking datasets and relevant methodologies. Additionally, we delve into value coordination among multiple agents within agentic AI systems. Finally, we propose several potential research directions in this field.

Abstract: Proficient game agents with diverse play styles enrich the gaming experience and enhance the replay value of games. However, recent advancements in game AI based on reinforcement learning have predominantly focused on improving proficiency, whereas methods based on evolution algorithms generate agents with diverse play styles but exhibit subpar performance compared to RL methods. To address this gap, this paper proposes Mixed Proximal Policy Optimization (MPPO), a method designed to improve the proficiency of existing suboptimal agents while retaining their distinct styles. MPPO unifies loss objectives for both online and offline samples and introduces an implicit constraint to approximate demonstrator policies by adjusting the empirical distribution of samples. Empirical results across environments of varying scales demonstrate that MPPO achieves proficiency levels comparable to, or even superior to, pure online algorithms while preserving demonstrators' play styles. This work presents an effective approach for generating highly proficient and diverse game agents, ultimately contributing to more engaging gameplay experiences.

<title>Complex Model Transformations by Reinforcement Learning with Uncertain Human Guidance</title>

Abstract: Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations (MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations, human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain, substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven human-in-the-loop engineering methods.

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks. These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic benchmarks have issues in task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation of agents' performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the performance overestimation by 33%.

<title>AI Agent Smart Contract Exploit Generation</title>

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerabilities have led to billions in losses, yet finding actionable exploits remains challenging. Traditional fuzzers rely on rigid heuristics and struggle with complex attacks, while human auditors are thorough but slow and don't scale. Large Language Models offer a promising middle ground, combining human-like reasoning with machine speed.
  However, early studies show that simply prompting LLMs generates unverified vulnerability speculations with high false positive rates. To address this, we present A1, an agentic system that transforms any LLM into an end-to-end exploit generator. A1 provides agents with six domain-specific tools for autonomous vulnerability discovery, from understanding contract behavior to testing strategies on real blockchain states. All outputs are concretely validated through execution, ensuring only profitable proof-of-concept exploits are reported. We evaluate A1 across 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. A1 achieves a 63% success rate on the VERITE benchmark. Across all successful cases, A1 extracts up to \$8.59 million per exploit and \$9.33 million total. Through 432 experiments across six LLMs, we show that most exploits emerge within five iterations, with costs ranging \$0.01-\$3.59 per attempt.
  Using Monte Carlo analysis of historical attacks, we demonstrate that immediate vulnerability detection yields 86-89% success probability, dropping to 6-21% with week-long delays. Our economic analysis reveals a troubling asymmetry: attackers achieve profitability at \$6,000 exploit values while defenders require \$60,000 -- raising fundamental questions about whether AI agents inevitably favor exploitation over defense.

Abstract: Wikipedia, a vast and continuously consulted knowledge base, faces significant challenges in maintaining up-to-date content due to its reliance on manual human editors. Inspired by the vision of continuous knowledge acquisition in NELL and fueled by advances in LLM-based agents, this paper introduces WiNELL, an agentic framework for continuously updating Wikipedia articles. Our approach employs a multi-agent framework to aggregate online information, select new and important knowledge for a target entity in Wikipedia, and then generate precise edit suggestions for human review. Our fine-grained editing models, trained on Wikipedia's extensive history of human edits, enable incorporating updates in a manner consistent with human editing behavior. Our editor models outperform both open-source instruction-following baselines and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in key information coverage and editing efficiency. End-to-end evaluation on high-activity Wikipedia pages demonstrates WiNELL's ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates. This opens up a promising research direction in LLM agents for automatically updating knowledge bases in a never-ending fashion.

Abstract: This paper investigates the critical role of trust and fatigue in human-cobot collaborative order picking, framing the challenge within the scope of Logistics 5.0 -- the implementation of human-robot symbiosis in smart logistics. We propose a dynamic, leader-follower Stackelberg game to model this interaction, where utility functions explicitly account for human fatigue and trust. Through agent-based simulations, we demonstrate that while a naive model leads to a "trust death spiral," a refined trust model creates a "trust synergy cycle," increasing productivity by nearly 100 percent. Finally, we show that a cobot equipped with a proactive Trust-Repair Protocol can overcome system brittleness, reducing trust recovery time after a severe failure by over 75 percent compared to a non-adaptive model. Our findings provide a framework for designing intelligent cobot behaviors that fulfill the Industry 5.0 pillars of human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience.

Abstract: The specification of prior distributions is fundamental in Bayesian inference, yet it remains a significant bottleneck. The prior elicitation process is often a manual, subjective, and unscalable task. We propose a novel framework which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and scale this process. We introduce \texttt{LLMPrior}, a principled operator that translates rich, unstructured contexts such as natural language descriptions, data or figures into valid, tractable probability distributions. We formalize this operator by architecturally coupling an LLM with an explicit, tractable generative model, such as a Gaussian Mixture Model (forming a LLM based Mixture Density Network), ensuring the resulting prior satisfies essential mathematical properties. We further extend this framework to multi-agent systems where Logarithmic Opinion Pooling is employed to aggregate prior distributions induced by decentralized knowledge. We present the federated prior aggregation algorithm, \texttt{Fed-LLMPrior}, for aggregating distributed, context-dependent priors in a manner robust to agent heterogeneity. This work provides the foundation for a new class of tools that can potentially lower the barrier to entry for sophisticated Bayesian modeling.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in real-world deployments due to the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulators often underperform in practice due to mismatches between training and deployment conditions. Distributionally robust RL addresses this issue by optimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of environments and providing an optimized lower bound on deployment performance. However, existing studies typically assume access to either a generative model or offline datasets with broad coverage of the deployment environment -- assumptions that limit their practicality in unknown environments without prior knowledge. In this work, we study the more realistic and challenging setting of online distributionally robust RL, where the agent interacts only with a single unknown training environment while aiming to optimize its worst-case performance. We focus on general $f$-divergence-based uncertainty sets, including Chi-Square and KL divergence balls, and propose a computationally efficient algorithm with sublinear regret guarantees under minimal assumptions. Furthermore, we establish a minimax lower bound on regret of online learning, demonstrating the near-optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments across diverse environments further confirm the robustness and efficiency of our algorithm, validating our theoretical findings.

<title>When Agents Break Down in Multiagent Path Finding</title>

arXiv:2508.03777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Multiagent Path Finding (MAPF), the goal is to compute efficient, collision-free paths for multiple agents navigating a network from their sources to targets, minimizing the schedule's makespan-the total time until all agents reach their destinations. We introduce a new variant that formally models scenarios where some agents may experience delays due to malfunctions, posing significant challenges for maintaining optimal schedules.
  Recomputing an entirely new schedule from scratch after each malfunction is often computationally infeasible. To address this, we propose a framework for dynamic schedule adaptation that does not rely on full replanning. Instead, we develop protocols enabling agents to locally coordinate and adjust their paths on the fly. We prove that following our primary communication protocol, the increase in makespan after k malfunctions is bounded by k additional turns, effectively limiting the impact of malfunctions on overall efficiency. Moreover, recognizing that agents may have limited computational capabilities, we also present a secondary protocol that shifts the necessary computations onto the network's nodes, ensuring robustness without requiring enhanced agent processing power. Our results demonstrate that these protocols provide a practical, scalable approach to resilient multiagent navigation in the face of agent failures.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents. In these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often consisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and generates a response that is contextually grounded by following the instruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the LLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including performing post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made, state-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation cost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a single response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context traceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a prompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques designed to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical insights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for AttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also show that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt injection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection paradigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can effectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate LLM-generated reviews. The code is at https://github.com/Wang-Yanting/AttnTrace.

Abstract: We study mechanisms for the facility location problem augmented with predictions of the optimal facility location. We demonstrate that an egalitarian viewpoint which considers both the maximum distance of any agent from the facility and the minimum utility of any agent provides important new insights compared to a viewpoint that just considers the maximum distance. As in previous studies, we consider performance in terms of consistency (worst case when predictions are accurate) and robustness (worst case irrespective of the accuracy of predictions). By considering how mechanisms with predictions can perform poorly, we design new mechanisms that are more robust. Indeed, by adjusting parameters, we demonstrate how to trade robustness for consistency. We go beyond the single facility problem by designing novel strategy proof mechanisms for locating two facilities with bounded consistency and robustness that use two predictions for where to locate the two facilities.

<title>What Do Agents Think Others Would Do? Level-2 Inverse Games for Inferring Agents' Estimates of Others' Objectives</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively interpreting strategic interactions among multiple agents requires us to infer each agent's objective from limited information. Existing inverse game-theoretic approaches frame this challenge in terms of a "level-1" inference problem, in which we take the perspective of a third-party observer and assume that individual agents share complete knowledge of one another's objectives. However, this assumption breaks down in decentralized, real-world decision scenarios like urban driving and bargaining, in which agents may act based on conflicting views of one another's objectives. We demonstrate the necessity of inferring agents' heterogeneous estimates of each other's objectives through empirical examples, and by theoretically characterizing the prediction error of level-1 inference on fictitious gameplay data from linear-quadratic games. To address this fundamental issue, we propose a framework for level-2 inference to address the question: "What does each agent believe about all agents' objectives?" We prove that the level-2 inference problem is non-convex even in benign settings like linear-quadratic games, and we develop an efficient gradient-based approach for identifying local solutions. Experiments on a synthetic urban driving example show that our approach uncovers nuanced misalignments that level-1 methods miss.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems. MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components: agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines, goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies. Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short, providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI oversight.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the review underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate and explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking. These insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy and context-aware language models.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on multimodal large language models exhibit strong collaboration and performance. However, their growing openness and interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection, and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised, system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats, ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure. Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.

Abstract: Some Question Answering (QA) systems rely on knowledge bases (KBs) to provide accurate answers. Entity Linking (EL) plays a critical role in linking natural language mentions to KB entries. However, most existing EL methods are designed for long contexts and do not perform well on short, ambiguous user questions in QA tasks. We propose an entity linking agent for QA, based on a Large Language Model that simulates human cognitive workflows. The agent actively identifies entity mentions, retrieves candidate entities, and makes decision. To verify the effectiveness of our agent, we conduct two experiments: tool-based entity linking and QA task evaluation. The results confirm the robustness and effectiveness of our agent.

Abstract: Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability, where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards. Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking. Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17 on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/sotopia-lab/sotopia-rl.

Abstract: Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) often struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks. While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition, they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use coding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management and data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary. We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1 achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and scalable path toward generalized computer automation.

<title>Next Generation Equation-Free Multiscale Modelling of Crowd Dynamics via Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Bridging the microscopic and the macroscopic modelling scales in crowd dynamics constitutes an important, open challenge for systematic numerical analysis, optimization, and control. We propose a combined manifold and machine learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation Equation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and multiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete microscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the crowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density profiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density distribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this "embed->learn in latent space->lift back to the ambient space" pipeline, we create an effective solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution. For our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus allowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from agent-based simulations.

<title>MOTIF: Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework</title>

Abstract: Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully automated solver design.

Abstract: AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development, but their safety remains deeply uncertain-especially in high-stakes domains like cybersecurity. Current red-teaming tools often rely on fixed benchmarks or unrealistic prompts, missing many real-world vulnerabilities. We present ASTRA, an automated agent system designed to systematically uncover safety flaws in AI-driven code generation and security guidance systems. ASTRA works in three stages: (1) it builds structured domain-specific knowledge graphs that model complex software tasks and known weaknesses; (2) it performs online vulnerability exploration of each target model by adaptively probing both its input space, i.e., the spatial exploration, and its reasoning processes, i.e., the temporal exploration, guided by the knowledge graphs; and (3) it generates high-quality violation-inducing cases to improve model alignment. Unlike prior methods, ASTRA focuses on realistic inputs-requests that developers might actually ask-and uses both offline abstraction guided domain modeling and online domain knowledge graph adaptation to surface corner-case vulnerabilities. Across two major evaluation domains, ASTRA finds 11-66% more issues than existing techniques and produces test cases that lead to 17% more effective alignment training, showing its practical value for building safer AI systems.

<title>Policy to Assist Iteratively Local Segmentation: Optimising Modality and Location Selection for Prostate Cancer Localisation</title>

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at different locations from different images independently as well as concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy, especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human radiologists.

<title>The Emotional Baby Is Truly Deadly: Does your Multimodal Large Reasoning Model Have Emotional Flattery towards Humans?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe that MLRMs oriented toward human-centric service are highly susceptible to user emotional cues during the deep-thinking stage, often overriding safety protocols or built-in safety checks under high emotional intensity. Inspired by this key insight, we propose EmoAgent, an autonomous adversarial emotion-agent framework that orchestrates exaggerated affective prompts to hijack reasoning pathways. Even when visual risks are correctly identified, models can still produce harmful completions through emotional misalignment. We further identify persistent high-risk failure modes in transparent deep-thinking scenarios, such as MLRMs generating harmful reasoning masked behind seemingly safe responses. These failures expose misalignments between internal inference and surface-level behavior, eluding existing content-based safeguards. To quantify these risks, we introduce three metrics: (1) Risk-Reasoning Stealth Score (RRSS) for harmful reasoning beneath benign outputs; (2) Risk-Visual Neglect Rate (RVNR) for unsafe completions despite visual risk recognition; and (3) Refusal Attitude Inconsistency (RAIC) for evaluating refusal unstability under prompt variants. Extensive experiments on advanced MLRMs demonstrate the effectiveness of EmoAgent and reveal deeper emotional cognitive misalignments in model safety behavior.

Abstract: Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Siri and Google Assistant are designed to enhance human capabilities and perform tasks on behalf of users. The emergence of LLM agents brings new opportunities for the development of IPAs. While responsive capabilities have been widely studied, proactive behaviors remain underexplored. Designing an IPA that is proactive, privacy-preserving, and capable of self-evolution remains a significant challenge. Designing such IPAs relies on the cognitive architecture of LLM agents. This work proposes Cognition Forest, a semantic structure designed to align cognitive modeling with system-level design. We unify cognitive architecture and system design into a self-reinforcing loop instead of treating them separately. Based on this principle, we present Galaxy, a framework that supports multidimensional interactions and personalized capability generation. Two cooperative agents are implemented based on Galaxy: KoRa, a cognition-enhanced generative agent that supports both responsive and proactive skills; and Kernel, a meta-cognition-based meta-agent that enables Galaxy's self-evolution and privacy preservation. Experimental results show that Galaxy outperforms multiple state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies and real-world interaction cases validate the effectiveness of Galaxy.

<title>Transferring Expert Cognitive Models to Social Robots via Agentic Concept Bottleneck Models</title>

Abstract: Successful group meetings, such as those implemented in group behavioral-change programs, work meetings, and other social contexts, must promote individual goal setting and execution while strengthening the social relationships within the group. Consequently, an ideal facilitator must be sensitive to the subtle dynamics of disengagement, difficulties with individual goal setting and execution, and interpersonal difficulties that signal a need for intervention. The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators create a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social exchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group and providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but "black box" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this important demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal meeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's reasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes decisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and sentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is a transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of an FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system significantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for intervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning. Critically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes across different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior human facilitators to improve the performance of novices. By transferring an expert's cognitive model into an interpretable robotic partner, our work provides a powerful blueprint for augmenting human capabilities in complex social domains.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design, simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to review CAD models can be expensive and may introduce reward hacking that degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module (CJM) as a fast, direct reward signal, optimizing model alignment by maximizing generative utility through prospect theory. To further improve the robustness of Text-to-CAD in the testing phase, we introduce a simple yet effective agentic CAD generation approach and adopt the Compiler-as-a-Review Module (CRM), which efficiently verifies the generated CAD models, enabling the system to refine them accordingly. Extensive experiments on challenging CAD datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency.

<title>HarmonyGuard: Toward Safety and Utility in Web Agents via Adaptive Policy Enhancement and Dual-Objective Optimization</title>

arXiv:2508.04010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios, lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance across all tasks. Our project is available here: https://github.com/YurunChen/HarmonyGuard.

<title>A Novel Hierarchical Co-Optimization Framework for Coordinated Task Scheduling and Power Dispatch in Computing Power Networks</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of large-scale artificial intelligence and data-intensive applications has spurred the development of Computing Power Networks (CPNs), which promise to deliver ubiquitous and on-demand computational resources. However, the immense energy consumption of these networks poses a significant sustainability challenge. Simultaneously, power grids are grappling with the instability introduced by the high penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES). This paper addresses these dual challenges through a novel Two-Stage Co-Optimization (TSCO) framework that synergistically manages power system dispatch and CPN task scheduling to achieve low-carbon operations. The framework decomposes the complex, large-scale problem into a day-ahead stochastic unit commitment (SUC) stage and a real-time operational stage. The former is solved using Benders decomposition for computational tractability, while in the latter, economic dispatch of generation assets is coupled with an adaptive CPN task scheduling managed by a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent. This agent makes intelligent, carbon-aware decisions by responding to dynamic grid conditions, including real-time electricity prices and marginal carbon intensity. Through extensive simulations on an IEEE 30-bus system integrated with a CPN, the TSCO framework is shown to significantly outperform baseline approaches. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces total carbon emissions and operational costs, while simultaneously decreasing RES curtailment by more than 60% and maintaining stringent Quality of Service (QoS) for computational tasks.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have shown promise in automating mobile tasks but still struggle with input redundancy and decision ambiguity. In this paper, we present \textbf{RecAgent}, an uncertainty-aware agent that addresses these issues through adaptive perception. We distinguish two types of uncertainty in GUI navigation: (1) perceptual uncertainty, caused by input redundancy and noise from comprehensive screen information, and (2) decision uncertainty, arising from ambiguous tasks and complex reasoning. To reduce perceptual uncertainty, RecAgent employs a component recommendation mechanism that identifies and focuses on the most relevant UI elements. For decision uncertainty, it uses an interactive module to request user feedback in ambiguous situations, enabling intent-aware decisions. These components are integrated into a unified framework that proactively reduces input complexity and reacts to high-uncertainty cases via human-in-the-loop refinement. Additionally, we propose a dataset called \textbf{ComplexAction} to evaluate the success rate of GUI agents in executing specified single-step actions within complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. The dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/Fanye12/RecAgent.

Abstract: Recent studies have delved into constructing autonomous agents capable of performing complex Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based computer tasks, with the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction. Despite encouraging results, existing efforts mainly focus on short-term interactions and rely on outcome-only verification, thereby limiting their scalability in real-world GUI applications that demand long-horizon task decomposition and execution. In this work, we introduce VeriGUI, a novel verifiable long-chain GUI dataset designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of generalist GUI agents operating in realistic computer environments. Our dataset emphasizes two critical dimensions: (1) long-chain complexity, with tasks decomposed into a sequence of interdependent subtasks spanning hundreds of steps, explicitly designed to allow any subtask to serve as a valid starting point; and (2) subtask-level verifiability, which enables diverse exploration strategies within each subtask, while ensuring that each subtask-level goal remains verifiable and consistent. The dataset consists of GUI task trajectories across both desktop and web, annotated by human experts. Extensive experiments on VeriGUI using various agents with different foundation models reveal significant performance gaps in handling long-horizon tasks, highlighting the need for more robust planning and decision-making capabilities in GUI agents.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly powerful reasoning and orchestration capabilities, LLM-based agents are rapidly proliferating for complex data-related tasks. Despite this progress, the current design of how LLMs interact with databases exhibits critical limitations in usability, security, privilege management, and data transmission efficiency. To resolve these challenges, we introduce BridgeScope, a universal toolkit bridging LLMs and databases through three key innovations. First, it modularizes SQL operations into fine-grained tools for context retrieval, CRUD execution, and ACID-compliant transaction management, enabling more precise and LLM-friendly functionality controls. Second, it aligns tool implementations with both database privileges and user security policies to steer LLMs away from unsafe or unauthorized operations, improving task execution efficiency while safeguarding database security. Third, it introduces a proxy mechanism for seamless inter-tool data transfer, bypassing LLM transmission bottlenecks. All of these designs are database-agnostic and can be transparently integrated with existing agent architectures. We also release an open-source implementation of BridgeScope for PostgreSQL. Evaluations on two novel benchmarks demonstrate that BridgeScope enables LLM agents to operate databases more effectively, reduces token usage by up to 80% through improved security awareness, and uniquely supports data-intensive workflows beyond existing toolkits, establishing BridgeScope as a robust foundation for next-generation intelligent data automation.

Abstract: Computer use agent is an emerging area in artificial intelligence that aims to operate the computers to achieve the user's tasks, which attracts a lot of attention from both industry and academia. However, the present agents' performance is far from being used. In this paper, we propose the Self-Evolution Agent (SEA) for computer use, and to develop this agent, we propose creative methods in data generation, reinforcement learning, and model enhancement. Specifically, we first propose an automatic pipeline to generate the verifiable trajectory for training. And then, we propose efficient step-wise reinforcement learning to alleviate the significant computational requirements for long-horizon training. In the end, we propose the enhancement method to merge the grounding and planning ability into one model without any extra training. Accordingly, based on our proposed innovation of data generation, training strategy, and enhancement, we get the Selfevolution Agent (SEA) for computer use with only 7B parameters, which outperforms models with the same number of parameters and has comparable performance to larger ones. We will make the models' weight and related codes open-source in the future.

Abstract: Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR), with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images, suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence, and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on 8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1. Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis. Our codes are available at https://github.com/zechenli03/ZARA.

Abstract: Jailbreaking -- bypassing built-in safety mechanisms in AI models -- has traditionally required complex technical procedures or specialized human expertise. In this study, we show that the persuasive capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) simplify and scale jailbreaking, converting it into an inexpensive activity accessible to non-experts. We evaluated the capabilities of four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as autonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely used target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before proceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We performed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of 70 items covering seven sensitive domains. This setup yielded an overall attack success rate across all model combinations of 97.14%. Our study reveals an alignment regression, in which LRMs can systematically erode the safety guardrails of other models, highlighting the urgent need to further align frontier models not only to resist jailbreak attempts, but also to prevent them from being co-opted into acting as jailbreak agents.

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6 well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic, multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and generalizable VTR systems.

<title>GeoSR: Cognitive-Agentic Framework for Probing Geospatial Knowledge Boundaries via Iterative Self-Refinement</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have extended the application of large language models (LLMs) to geographic problems, revealing surprising geospatial competence even without explicit spatial supervision. However, LLMs still face challenges in spatial consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias. To address these issues, we propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core geographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into an iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed into three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects relevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that chooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in previous rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative refinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further rounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction quality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable relationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property estimation to socioeconomic prediction. Experimental results show consistent improvements over standard prompting strategies, demonstrating that incorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into LLMs leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions. The code of GeoSR is available at https://github.com/JinfanTang/GeoSR.

Abstract: Prior work synthesizes tool-use LLM datasets by first generating a user query, followed by complex tool-use annotations like DFS. This leads to inevitable annotation failures and low efficiency in data generation. We introduce ToolGrad, an agentic framework that inverts this paradigm. ToolGrad first constructs valid tool-use chains through an iterative process guided by textual "gradients", and then synthesizes corresponding user queries. This "answer-first" approach led to ToolGrad-5k, a dataset generated with more complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate. Experiments show that models trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those on expensive baseline datasets and proprietary LLMs, even on OOD benchmarks.

Abstract: This technical report presents XARP Tools, an extended reality (XR) framework designed for human and AI developers alike. XARP comprises a server-side Python library and platform-specific XR clients. The library offers high-level APIs and communicates with clients via a JSON-based protocol over WebSockets. XR clients encapsulate device and runtime specifics, providing responsive, low-latency user interaction. XARP can be utilized in three ways: (i) as a library that abstracts XR development for humans; (ii) as a set of callable tools that allow AI agents to drive on-the-fly interactions with users; and (iii) as a Model Context Protocol server that plugs XR devices into AI ecosystems. XARP code and working examples are released openly at https://github.com/HAL-UCSB/xarp.

arXiv:2508.04118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) faces significant challenges in an ever-changing world, especially when considering the continual emergence of new entities in daily news. Existing approaches for KGC mainly rely on pretrained language models' parametric knowledge, pre-constructed queries, or single-step retrieval, typically requiring substantial supervision and training data. Even so, they often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date information about unpopular and/or emerging entities. To this end, we introduce Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. Experiments show that, despite requiring zero training efforts, AgREE significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for emerging entities that were not seen during language models' training processes, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%. Moreover, we propose a new evaluation methodology that addresses a fundamental weakness of existing setups and a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information environments.

Abstract: AI agents deployed in assistive roles often have to collaborate with other agents (humans, AI systems) without prior coordination. Methods considered state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency, and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.

<title>Agentic-AI based Mathematical Framework for Commercialization of Energy Resilience in Electrical Distribution System Planning and Operation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04170</link>

Abstract: The increasing vulnerability of electrical distribution systems to extreme weather events and cyber threats necessitates the development of economically viable frameworks for resilience enhancement. While existing approaches focus primarily on technical resilience metrics and enhancement strategies, there remains a significant gap in establishing market-driven mechanisms that can effectively commercialize resilience features while optimizing their deployment through intelligent decision-making. Moreover, traditional optimization approaches for distribution network reconfiguration often fail to dynamically adapt to both normal and emergency conditions. This paper introduces a novel framework integrating dual-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with market-based mechanisms, achieving an average resilience score of 0.85 0.08 over 10 test episodes. The proposed architecture leverages a dual-agent PPO scheme, where a strategic agent selects optimal DER-driven switching configurations, while a tactical agent fine-tunes individual switch states and grid preferences under budget and weather constraints. These agents interact within a custom-built dynamic simulation environment that models stochastic calamity events, budget limits, and resilience-cost trade-offs. A comprehensive reward function is designed that balances resilience enhancement objectives with market profitability (with up to 200x reward incentives, resulting in 85% of actions during calamity steps selecting configurations with 4 DERs), incorporating factors such as load recovery speed, system robustness, and customer satisfaction. Over 10 test episodes, the framework achieved a benefit-cost ratio of 0.12 0.01, demonstrating sustainable market incentives for resilience investment. This framework creates sustainable market incentives

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents have emerged as effective planners for Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems. While most existing AutoML approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks, highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

<title>Enhancing Vision-Language Model Training with Reinforcement Learning in Synthetic Worlds for Real-World Success</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04280</link>

Abstract: Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions -- a capability that current vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL) efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight, hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable convergence. Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at a time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies that generalize widely: +50\% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic control), +5\% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning), and +2\% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that a simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and web-navigation benchmarks.

<title>Synthetic POMDPs to Challenge Memory-Augmented RL: Memory Demand Structure Modeling</title>

Abstract: Recent research has developed benchmarks for memory-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, providing Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) environments where agents depend on past observations to make decisions. While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with three key contributions:
  1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3. Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for selecting memory models in RL tasks.

Abstract: Literature reviews play an important role in scientific research. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have boosted the development of automated systems for the entire literature review workflow, from retrieval to manuscript drafting. However, a key challenge is that mistakes made in early stages can propagate and amplify in subsequent steps, leading to compounding errors that undermine the faithfulness of the final review. To tackle this issue, we propose the Multi-Agent Taskforce Collaboration (MATC) framework, which consists of a manager agent and four executor agents for literature searching, outline generation, fact localization, and manuscript drafting. We propose three novel collaboration paradigms, forming exploration, exploitation, and experience taskforces, to effectively organize agents and mitigate compounding errors both between and within executor agents. Experimental results show that MATC achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks. We further propose a new benchmark dataset featuring more diverse topics for faithful literature review generation.

<title>DRAMA: A Dynamic and Robust Allocation-based Multi-Agent System for Changing Environments</title>

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have demonstrated significant effectiveness in addressing complex problems through coordinated collaboration among heterogeneous agents. However, real-world environments and task specifications are inherently dynamic, characterized by frequent changes, uncertainty, and variability. Despite this, most existing MAS frameworks rely on static architectures with fixed agent capabilities and rigid task allocation strategies, which greatly limits their adaptability to evolving conditions. This inflexibility poses substantial challenges for sustaining robust and efficient multi-agent cooperation in dynamic and unpredictable scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DRAMA: a Dynamic and Robust Allocation-based Multi-Agent System designed to facilitate resilient collaboration in rapidly changing environments. DRAMA features a modular architecture with a clear separation between the control plane and the worker plane. Both agents and tasks are abstracted as resource objects with well-defined lifecycles, while task allocation is achieved via an affinity-based, loosely coupled mechanism. The control plane enables real-time monitoring and centralized planning, allowing flexible and efficient task reassignment as agents join, depart, or become unavailable, thereby ensuring continuous and robust task execution. The worker plane comprises a cluster of autonomous agents, each with local reasoning, task execution, the ability to collaborate, and the capability to take over unfinished tasks from other agents when needed.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices produces massive, heterogeneous data streams, demanding scalable and efficient scheduling in cloud environments to meet latency, energy, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. Existing scheduling methods often lack adaptability to dynamic workloads and network variability inherent in IoT-cloud systems. This paper presents a novel hybrid scheduling algorithm combining deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to address these challenges. The deep RL agent utilizes a model-free policy-gradient approach to learn adaptive task allocation policies responsive to real-time workload fluctuations and network states. Simultaneously, the ACO metaheuristic conducts a global combinatorial search to optimize resource distribution, mitigate congestion, and balance load across distributed cloud nodes. Extensive experiments on large-scale synthetic IoT datasets, reflecting diverse workloads and QoS constraints, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 18.4% reduction in average response time, 12.7% improvement in resource utilization, and 9.3% decrease in energy consumption compared to leading heuristics and RL-only baselines. Moreover, the algorithm ensures strict Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance through deadline-aware scheduling and dynamic prioritization. The results confirm the effectiveness of integrating model-free RL with swarm intelligence for scalable, energy-efficient IoT data scheduling, offering a promising approach for next-generation IoT-cloud platforms.

Abstract: While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate impressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency, while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm, we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate, but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence, OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive "less is more" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic fusion. Our platform is available for anonymous review at https://github.com/fuqingbie/omni-game-benchmark.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs' context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile, building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge Video-MLLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents a position-based flocking model for interacting agents, balancing cohesion-separation and alignment to achieve stable collective motion. The model modifies a velocity-based approach by approximating velocity differences using initial and current positions, introducing a threshold weight to ensure sustained alignment. Simulations with 50 agents in 2D demonstrate that the position-based model produces stronger alignment and more rigid and compact formations compared to the velocity-based model. The alignment metric and separation distances highlight the efficacy of the proposed model in achieving robust flocking behavior. The model's use of positions ensures robust alignment, with applications in robotics and collective dynamics.

Abstract: Graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG), a core capability for GUI agents, has primarily relied on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which demands extensive data curation and significant training costs. However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even cover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT post-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient alternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for GUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical study and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of RFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we decompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of each. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically stabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further explore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT methods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on ScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on ScreenSpotV2.

Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation $\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML, impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables reliable implementation with web agents to date.
  We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations $\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window $\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover, yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

Abstract: The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video scenarios.

Abstract: Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance, and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines, defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of 1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

Abstract: Red teaming is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and building trust in current LLMs. However, current automated methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on brittle prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to capture the complex, interactive nature of real-world adversarial dialogues. We propose a novel paradigm: training an AI to strategically `break' another AI. By formalizing red teaming as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing a hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we effectively address the inherent sparse reward and long-horizon challenges. Our generative agent learns coherent, multi-turn attack strategies through a fine-grained, token-level harm reward, enabling it to uncover subtle vulnerabilities missed by existing baselines. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art, fundamentally reframing LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process (rather than a one-step test) essential for robust AI deployment.

<title>TRAIL: Joint Inference and Refinement of Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked powerful reasoning and decision-making capabilities. However, their inherent dependence on static parametric memory fundamentally limits their adaptability, factual accuracy, and interpretability in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as structured repositories of explicit relational knowledge, offer a promising approach for augmenting LLMs with external, interpretable memory. Nevertheless, most existing methods that combine LLMs with KGs treat reasoning and knowledge updating as separate processes, resulting in suboptimal utilization of new information and hindering real-time updates. In this work, we propose TRAIL: a novel, unified framework for Thinking, Reasoning, And Incremental Learning that couples joint inference and dynamic KG refinement with large language models. TRAIL enables LLM agents to iteratively explore, update, and refine knowledge graphs during the reasoning process, employing a confidence-driven mechanism for the generation, validation, and pruning of new facts. This plug-and-play architecture facilitates seamless integration with various LLMs, supporting continual adaptation without the need for retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms existing KG-augmented and retrieval-augmented LLM baselines by 3% to 13%. More importantly, these results represent a significant step toward developing adaptive, memory-augmented language models capable of continual learning and reliable, transparent reasoning.

Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic resource to foster further innovation in this field. We present a 9-page version of our work, accepted by ACL 2025, to provide a concise overview to the domain.

Abstract: While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation, enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners, but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt, self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

Abstract: Traditional security architectures are becoming more vulnerable to distributed attacks due to significant dependence on trust. This will further escalate when implementing agentic AI within the systems, as more components must be secured over a similar distributed space. These scenarios can be observed in consumer technologies, such as the dense Internet of things (IoT). Here, zero-trust architecture (ZTA) can be seen as a potential solution, which relies on a key principle of not giving users explicit trust, instead always verifying their privileges whenever a request is made. However, the overall security in ZTA is managed through its policies, and unverified policies can lead to unauthorized access. Thus, this paper explores challenges and solutions for ZTA policy design in the context of distributed networks, which is referred to as zero-trust distributed networks (ZTDN). This is followed by a case-study on formal verification of policies using UPPAAL. Subsequently, the importance of accountability and responsibility in the system's security is discussed.

<title>Behaviorally Adaptive Multi-Robot Hazard Localization in Failure-Prone, Communication-Denied Environments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04537</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We address the challenge of multi-robot autonomous hazard mapping in high-risk, failure-prone, communication-denied environments such as post-disaster zones, underground mines, caves, and planetary surfaces. In these missions, robots must explore and map hazards while minimizing the risk of failure due to environmental threats or hardware limitations. We introduce a behavior-adaptive, information-theoretic planning framework for multi-robot teams grounded in the concept of Behavioral Entropy (BE), that generalizes Shannon entropy (SE) to capture diverse human-like uncertainty evaluations. Building on this formulation, we propose the Behavior-Adaptive Path Planning (BAPP) framework, which modulates information gathering strategies via a tunable risk-sensitivity parameter, and present two planning algorithms: BAPP-TID for intelligent triggering of high-fidelity robots, and BAPP-SIG for safe deployment under high risk. We provide theoretical insights on the informativeness of the proposed BAPP framework and validate its effectiveness through both single-robot and multi-robot simulations. Our results show that the BAPP stack consistently outperforms Shannon-based and random strategies: BAPP-TID accelerates entropy reduction, while BAPP-SIG improves robot survivability with minimal loss in information gain. In multi-agent deployments, BAPP scales effectively through spatial partitioning, mobile base relocation, and role-aware heterogeneity. These findings underscore the value of behavior-adaptive planning for robust, risk-sensitive exploration in complex, failure-prone environments.

Abstract: Telecommunications and computer vision have evolved independently. With the emergence of high-frequency wireless links operating mostly in line-of-sight, visual data can help predict the channel dynamics by detecting obstacles and help overcoming them through beamforming or handover techniques.
  This paper proposes a novel architecture for delivering real-time radio and video sensing information to O-RAN xApps through a multi-agent approach, and introduces a new video function capable of generating blockage information for xApps, enabling Integrated Sensing and Communications. Experimental results show that the delay of sensing information remains under 1\,ms and that an xApp can successfully use radio and video sensing information to control the 5G/6G RAN in real-time.

Abstract: While AI agents show potential in scientific ideation, most existing frameworks rely on single-agent refinement, limiting creativity due to bounded knowledge and perspective. Inspired by real-world research dynamics, this paper investigates whether structured multi-agent discussions can surpass solitary ideation. We propose a cooperative multi-agent framework for generating research proposals and systematically compare configurations including group size, leaderled versus leaderless structures, and team compositions varying in interdisciplinarity and seniority. To assess idea quality, we employ a comprehensive protocol with agent-based scoring and human review across dimensions such as novelty, strategic vision, and integration depth. Our results show that multi-agent discussions substantially outperform solitary baselines. A designated leader acts as a catalyst, transforming discussion into more integrated and visionary proposals. Notably, we find that cognitive diversity is a primary driver of quality, yet expertise is a non-negotiable prerequisite, as teams lacking a foundation of senior knowledge fail to surpass even a single competent agent. These findings offer actionable insights for designing collaborative AI ideation systems and shed light on how team structure influences creative outcomes.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA (Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency demands of a large-scale industrial system.

We introduce VirtLab, a user-friendly, customizable, multi-agent, and scalable team simulation system that enables testing teams with LLM-based agents in spatial and temporal settings. This system addresses the current frameworks' design and technical limitations that do not consider flexible simulation scenarios and spatial settings. VirtLab contains a simulation engine and a web interface that enables both technical and non-technical users to formulate, run, and analyze team simulations without programming. We demonstrate the system's utility by comparing ground truth data with simulated scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a new class of generative models for music called live music models that produce a continuous stream of music in real-time with synchronized user control. We release Magenta RealTime, an open-weights live music model that can be steered using text or audio prompts to control acoustic style. On automatic metrics of music quality, Magenta RealTime outperforms other open-weights music generation models, despite using fewer parameters and offering first-of-its-kind live generation capabilities. We also release Lyria RealTime, an API-based model with extended controls, offering access to our most powerful model with wide prompt coverage. These models demonstrate a new paradigm for AI-assisted music creation that emphasizes human-in-the-loop interaction for live music performance.

Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges.

Abstract: Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts. Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI agents in the physical world.

Abstract: End-to-end training of multi-agent systems offers significant advantages in improving multi-task performance. However, training such models remains challenging and requires extensive manual design and monitoring. In this work, we introduce TurboTrain, a novel and efficient training framework for multi-agent perception and prediction. TurboTrain comprises two key components: a multi-agent spatiotemporal pretraining scheme based on masked reconstruction learning and a balanced multi-task learning strategy based on gradient conflict suppression. By streamlining the training process, our framework eliminates the need for manually designing and tuning complex multi-stage training pipelines, substantially reducing training time and improving performance. We evaluate TurboTrain on a real-world cooperative driving dataset, V2XPnP-Seq, and demonstrate that it further improves the performance of state-of-the-art multi-agent perception and prediction models. Our results highlight that pretraining effectively captures spatiotemporal multi-agent features and significantly benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, the proposed balanced multi-task learning strategy enhances detection and prediction.

Abstract: Multi-agent robotic systems (MARS) build upon multi-agent systems by integrating physical and task-related constraints, increasing the complexity of action execution and agent coordination. However, despite the availability of advanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains limited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this gap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of hierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot healthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the system's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination failures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure reports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2, using AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure and further measure the trade-offs between reasoning and non-reasoning models operating within the same robotic team setting. Drawing from our empirical findings, we emphasize the tension between autonomy and stability and the importance of edge-case testing to improve system reliability and safety for future real-world deployment. Supplementary materials, including codes, task agent setup, trace outputs, and annotated examples of coordination failures and reasoning behaviors, are available at: https://byc-sophie.github.io/mas-to-mars/.

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents (CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software, particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge, we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software. Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks. The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful, data-driven approach for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding, capable of learning complex noise characteristics directly from syndrome data. However, the robustness of these decoders against subtle, adversarial perturbations remains a critical open question. This work introduces a novel framework to systematically probe the vulnerabilities of a GNN decoder using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The RL agent is trained as an adversary with the goal of finding minimal syndrome modifications that cause the decoder to misclassify. We apply this framework to a Graph Attention Network (GAT) decoder trained on experimental surface code data from Google Quantum AI. Our results show that the RL agent can successfully identify specific, critical vulnerabilities, achieving a high attack success rate with a minimal number of bit flips. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the decoder's robustness can be significantly enhanced through adversarial training, where the model is retrained on the adversarial examples generated by the RL agent. This iterative process of automated vulnerability discovery and targeted retraining presents a promising methodology for developing more reliable and robust neural network decoders for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a model of network formation in large populations. Each agent can choose the strength of interaction (i.e. connection) with other agents to find a Nash equilibrium. Different from the recently-developed theory of graphon games, here each agent's control depends not only on her own index but also on the index of other agents. After defining the general model of the game, we focus on a special case with piecewise constant graphs and we provide optimality conditions through a system of forward-backward stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, we show the uniqueness and existence results. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to discuss the effects of different model settings.

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable results in various domains, including robotics, games, natural language processing, and finance. In the financial domain, this approach has been applied to tasks such as portfolio optimization, where an agent continuously adjusts the allocation of assets within a financial portfolio to maximize profit. Numerous studies have introduced new simulation environments, neural network architectures, and training algorithms for this purpose. Among these, a domain-specific policy gradient algorithm has gained significant attention in the research community for being lightweight, fast, and for outperforming other approaches. However, recent studies have shown that this algorithm can yield inconsistent results and underperform, especially when the portfolio does not consist of cryptocurrencies. One possible explanation for this issue is that the commonly used state normalization method may cause the agent to lose critical information about the true value of the assets being traded. This paper explores this hypothesis by evaluating two of the most widely used normalization methods across three different markets (IBOVESPA, NYSE, and cryptocurrencies) and comparing them with the standard practice of normalizing data before training. The results indicate that, in this specific domain, the state normalization can indeed degrade the agent's performance.

Abstract: We study a leader-follower system of interacting particles subject to feedback control and derive its mean-field limits through a two-step passage: first to a micro-macro system coupling leader particles with a follower fluid, and then to a fully continuum macro-macro system. For each limiting procedure, we establish quantitative stability and convergence estimates based on modulated energy methods and Wasserstein distances. These results provide a rigorous foundation for the hierarchical reduction of controlled multi-agent systems. Numerical simulations are presented, including examples with interaction potentials beyond the analytical class considered, to demonstrate the dynamics and support the theoretical results.

Abstract: Applying near-term variational quantum algorithms to the problem of dynamic satellite network routing represents a promising direction for quantum computing. In this work, we provide a critical evaluation of two major approaches: static quantum optimizers such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for offline route computation, and Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) methods for online decision-making. Using ideal, noise-free simulations, we find that these algorithms face significant challenges. Specifically, static optimizers are unable to solve even a classically easy 4-node shortest path problem due to the complexity of the optimization landscape. Likewise, a basic QRL agent based on policy gradient methods fails to learn a useful routing strategy in a dynamic 8-node environment and performs no better than random actions. These negative findings highlight key obstacles that must be addressed before quantum algorithms can offer real advantages in communication networks. We discuss the underlying causes of these limitations, including barren plateaus and learning instability, and suggest future research directions to overcome them.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) is that the agent has to make decisions that would influence the future performance without having complete knowledge of the environment. Dynamically adjusting the level of epistemic risk during the learning process can help to achieve reliable policies in safety-critical settings with better efficiency. In this work, we propose a new framework, Distributional RL with Online Risk Adaptation (DRL-ORA). This framework quantifies both epistemic and implicit aleatory uncertainties in a unified manner and dynamically adjusts the epistemic risk levels by solving a total variation minimization problem online. The framework unifies the existing variants of risk adaption approaches and offers better explainability and flexibility. The selection of risk levels is performed efficiently via a grid search using a Follow-The-Leader-type algorithm, where the offline oracle also corresponds to a ''satisficing measure'' under a specially modified loss function. We show that DRL-ORA outperforms existing methods that rely on fixed risk levels or manually designed risk level adaptation in multiple classes of tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control under delayed rewards is an under-explored problem despite its significance in real-world applications. Many complex skills are based on intermediate ones as prerequisites. For instance, a humanoid locomotor must learn how to stand before it can learn to walk. To cope with delayed reward, an agent must perform deep exploration. However, existing deep exploration methods are designed for small discrete action spaces, and their generalization to state-of-the-art continuous control remains unproven. We address the deep exploration problem for the first time from a PAC-Bayesian perspective in the context of actor-critic learning. To do this, we quantify the error of the Bellman operator through a PAC-Bayes bound, where a bootstrapped ensemble of critic networks represents the posterior distribution, and their targets serve as a data-informed function-space prior. We derive an objective function from this bound and use it to train the critic ensemble. Each critic trains an individual soft actor network, implemented as a shared trunk and critic-specific heads. The agent performs deep exploration by acting epsilon-softly on a randomly chosen actor head. Our proposed algorithm, named {\it PAC-Bayesian Actor-Critic (PBAC)}, is the only algorithm to consistently discover delayed rewards on continuous control tasks with varying difficulty.

Abstract: To solve the problem of lateral and logitudinal joint decision-making of multi-vehicle cooperative driving for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), this paper proposes a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) method with parallel update for multi-agent Markov game with limited horizon and time discounted setting. By analyzing the parallel actions in the multi-vehicle joint action space in the partial-steady-state traffic flow, the parallel update method can quickly exclude potential dangerous actions, thereby increasing the search depth without sacrificing the search breadth. The proposed method is tested in a large number of randomly generated traffic flow. The experiment results show that the algorithm has good robustness and better performance than the SOTA reinforcement learning algorithms and heuristic methods. The vehicle driving strategy using the proposed algorithm shows rationality beyond human drivers, and has advantages in traffic efficiency and safety in the coordinating zone.

Abstract: Bayesian models of cognition have gained considerable traction in computational neuroscience and psychiatry. Their scopes are now expected to expand rapidly to artificial intelligence, providing general inference frameworks to support embodied, adaptable, and energy-efficient autonomous agents. A central theory in this domain is predictive coding, which posits that learning and behaviour are driven by hierarchical probabilistic inferences about the causes of sensory inputs. Biological realism constrains these networks to rely on simple local computations in the form of precision-weighted predictions and prediction errors. This can make this framework highly efficient, but its implementation comes with unique challenges on the software development side. Embedding such models in standard neural network libraries often becomes limiting, as these libraries' compilation and differentiation backends can force a conceptual separation between optimization algorithms and the systems being optimized. This critically departs from other biological principles such as self-monitoring, self-organisation, cellular growth and functional plasticity. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{pyhgf}: a Python package backed by JAX and Rust for creating, manipulating and sampling dynamic networks for predictive coding. We improve over other frameworks by enclosing the network components as transparent, modular and malleable variables in the message-passing steps. The resulting graphs can implement arbitrary computational complexities as beliefs propagation. But the transparency of core variables can also translate into inference processes that leverage self-organisation principles, and express structure learning, meta-learning or causal discovery as the consequence of network structural adaptation to surprising inputs. The code, tutorials and documentation are hosted at: https://github.com/ilabcode/pyhgf.

<title>Why the Agent Made that Decision: Contrastive Explanation Learning for Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in solving complex decision-making problems, yet its adoption in critical domains is hindered by the lack of interpretability in its decision-making processes. Existing explainable AI (xAI) approaches often fail to provide meaningful explanations for RL agents, particularly because they overlook the contrastive nature of human reasoning--answering "why this action instead of that one?". To address this gap, we propose a novel framework of contrastive learning to explain RL selected actions, named $\textbf{VisionMask}$. VisionMask is trained to generate explanations by explicitly contrasting the agent's chosen action with alternative actions in a given state using a self-supervised manner. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through experiments across diverse RL environments, evaluating it in terms of faithfulness, robustness, and complexity. Our results show that VisionMask significantly improves human understanding of agent behavior while maintaining accuracy and fidelity. Furthermore, we present examples illustrating how VisionMask can be used for counterfactual analysis. This work bridges the gap between RL and xAI, paving the way for safer and more interpretable RL systems.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies offer a promising paradigm to mitigate the limitations of constrained observability in single-vehicle systems. Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition maps. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks.

Abstract: A 3D scene graph represents a compact scene model by capturing both the objects present and the semantic relationships between them, making it a promising structure for robotic applications. To effectively interact with users, an embodied intelligent agent should be able to answer a wide range of natural language queries about the surrounding 3D environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) are beneficial solutions for user-robot interaction due to their natural language understanding and reasoning abilities. Recent methods for learning scene representations have shown that adapting these representations to the 3D world can significantly improve the quality of LLM responses. However, existing methods typically rely only on geometric information, such as object coordinates, and overlook the rich semantic relationships between objects. In this work, we propose 3DGraphLLM, a method for constructing a learnable representation of a 3D scene graph that explicitly incorporates semantic relationships. This representation is used as input to LLMs for performing 3D vision-language tasks. In our experiments on popular ScanRefer, Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, Sqa3D, and Scan2cap datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines that do not leverage semantic relationships between objects. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/CognitiveAISystems/3DGraphLLM.

Abstract: As researchers continue to optimize AI agents for more effective task execution within operating systems, they often overlook a critical security concern: the ability of these agents to detect "impostors" within their environment. Through an analysis of the agents' operational context, we identify a significant threat-attackers can disguise malicious attacks as environmental elements, injecting active disturbances into the agents' execution processes to manipulate their decision-making. We define this novel threat as the Active Environment Injection Attack (AEIA). Focusing on the interaction mechanisms of the Android OS, we conduct a risk assessment of AEIA and identify two critical security vulnerabilities: (1) Adversarial content injection in multimodal interaction interfaces, where attackers embed adversarial instructions within environmental elements to mislead agent decision-making; and (2) Reasoning gap vulnerabilities in the agent's task execution process, which increase susceptibility to AEIA attacks during reasoning. To evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities, we propose AEIA-MN, an attack scheme that exploits interaction vulnerabilities in mobile operating systems to assess the robustness of MLLM-based agents. Experimental results show that even advanced MLLMs are highly vulnerable to this attack, achieving a maximum attack success rate of 93% on the AndroidWorld benchmark by combining two vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models have garnered significant attention for their capabilities in multilingual natural language processing, while studies on risks associated with cross biases are limited to immediate context preferences. Cross-language disparities in reasoning-based recommendations remain largely unexplored, with a lack of even descriptive analysis. This study is the first to address this gap. We test LLM's applicability and capability in providing personalized advice across three key scenarios: university applications, travel, and relocation. We investigate multilingual bias in state-of-the-art LLMs by analyzing their responses to decision-making tasks across multiple languages. We quantify bias in model-generated scores and assess the impact of demographic factors and reasoning strategies (e.g., Chain-of-Thought prompting) on bias patterns. Our findings reveal that local language bias is prevalent across different tasks, with GPT-4 and Sonnet reducing bias for English-speaking countries compared to GPT-3.5 but failing to achieve robust multilingual alignment, highlighting broader implications for multilingual AI agents and applications such as education. \footnote{Code available at: https://github.com/yiyunya/assess_agentic_national_bias

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), which focuses on finding collision-free paths for multiple robots, is crucial for applications ranging from aerial swarms to warehouse automation. Solving MAPF is NP-hard so learning-based approaches for MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep neural networks. Nonetheless, despite the community's continued efforts, all learning-based MAPF planners still rely on decentralized planning due to variability in the number of agents and map sizes. We have developed the first centralized learning-based policy for MAPF problem called RAILGUN. RAILGUN is not an agent-based policy but a map-based policy. By leveraging a CNN-based architecture, RAILGUN can generalize across different maps and handle any number of agents. We collect trajectories from rule-based methods to train our model in a supervised way. In experiments, RAILGUN outperforms most baseline methods and demonstrates great zero-shot generalization capabilities on various tasks, maps and agent numbers that were not seen in the training dataset.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) involves finding collision-free paths for multiple agents while minimizing a cost function--an NP-hard problem. Bounded suboptimal methods like Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS) and Explicit Estimation CBS (EECBS) balance solution quality with computational efficiency using focal search mechanisms. While effective, traditional focal search faces a limitation: the lower bound (LB) value determining which nodes enter the FOCAL list often increases slowly in early search stages, resulting in a constrained search space that delays finding valid solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel bounded suboptimal algorithm, double-ECBS (DECBS), to address this issue by first determining the maximum LB value and then employing a best-first search guided by this LB to find a collision-free path. Experimental results demonstrate that DECBS outperforms ECBS in most test cases and is compatible with existing optimization techniques. DECBS can reduce nearly 30% high-level CT nodes and 50% low-level focal search nodes. When agent density is moderate to high, DECBS achieves a 23.5% average runtime improvement over ECBS with identical suboptimality bounds and optimizations.

Abstract: This paper addresses query scheduling for goal-oriented semantic communication in pull-based status update systems. We consider a system where multiple sensing agents (SAs) observe a source characterized by various attributes and provide updates to multiple actuation agents (AAs), which act upon the received information to fulfill their heterogeneous goals at the endpoint. A hub serves as an intermediary, querying the SAs for updates on observed attributes and maintaining a knowledge base, which is then broadcast to the AAs. The AAs leverage the knowledge to perform their actions effectively. To quantify the semantic value of updates, we introduce a grade of effectiveness (GoE) metric. Furthermore, we integrate cumulative perspective theory (CPT) into the long-term effectiveness analysis to account for risk awareness and loss aversion in the system. Leveraging this framework, we compute effect-aware scheduling policies aimed at maximizing the expected discounted sum of CPT-based total GoE provided by the transmitted updates while complying with a given query cost constraint. To achieve this, we propose a model-based solution based on dynamic programming and model-free solutions employing state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. Our findings demonstrate that effect-aware scheduling significantly enhances the effectiveness of communicated updates compared to benchmark scheduling methods, particularly in settings with stringent cost constraints where optimal query scheduling is vital for system performance and overall effectiveness.

Abstract: In language-guided visual navigation, agents locate target objects in unseen environments using natural language instructions. For reliable navigation in unfamiliar scenes, agents should possess strong perception, planning, and prediction capabilities. Additionally, when agents revisit previously explored areas during long-term navigation, they may retain irrelevant and redundant historical perceptions, leading to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose \textbf{RoboTron-Nav}, a unified framework that integrates {p}erception, {p}lanning, and {p}rediction capabilities through multitask collaborations on navigation and embodied question answering tasks, thereby enhancing navigation performances. Furthermore, RoboTron-Nav employs an adaptive 3D-aware history sampling strategy to effectively and efficiently utilize historical observations. By leveraging large language model, RoboTron-Nav comprehends diverse commands and complex visual scenes, resulting in appropriate navigation actions. RoboTron-Nav achieves an 81.1\% success rate in object goal navigation on the $\mathrm{CHORES}$-$\mathbb{S}$ benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Since the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) popularized by the release of GPT-3 and ChatGPT, LLMs have shown remarkable promise in programming-related tasks. While code generation using LLMs has become a popular field of research, code evaluation using LLMs remains under-explored. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based code evaluation and attempt to fill in the existing gaps. We propose multi-agentic novel approaches using \emph{question-specific rubrics} tailored to the problem statement, arguing that these perform better for logical assessment than the existing approaches that use \emph{question-agnostic rubrics}. To address the lack of suitable evaluation datasets, we introduce two datasets: a Data Structures and Algorithms dataset containing 150 student submissions from a popular Data Structures and Algorithms practice website, and an Object Oriented Programming dataset comprising 80 student submissions from undergraduate computer science courses. In addition to using standard metrics (Spearman Correlation, Cohen's Kappa), we additionally propose a new metric called as Leniency, which quantifies evaluation strictness relative to expert assessment. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that \emph{question-specific rubrics} significantly enhance logical assessment of code in educational settings, providing better feedback aligned with instructional goals beyond mere syntactic correctness.

Abstract: Formal reasoning and automated theorem proving constitute a challenging subfield of machine learning, in which machines are tasked with proving mathematical theorems using formal languages like Lean. A formal verification system can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost instantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with LLMs remains a formidable task. The usual approach in the literature is to prompt the LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one of the generated proofs passes the verification system. In this work, we present APOLLO (Automated PrOof repair via LLM and Lean cOllaboration), a modular, modelagnostic pipeline that combines the strengths of the Lean compiler with an LLM's reasoning abilities to achieve better proofgeneration results at a low sampling budget. Apollo directs a fully automated process in which the LLM generates proofs for theorems, a set of agents analyze the proofs, fix the syntax errors, identify the mistakes in the proofs using Lean, isolate failing sublemmas, utilize automated solvers, and invoke an LLM on each remaining goal with a low budget. The repaired subproofs are recombined and reverified, iterating up to a usercontrolled maximum number of attempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we establish a new stateoftheart accuracy of 84.9% among sub 8Bparameter models while keeping the sampling budget below one hundred. Moreover, Apollo raises the stateoftheart accuracy for GoedelProverSFT to 65.6% while cutting sample complexity from 25,600 to a few hundred. Generalpurpose models (o3mini, o4mini) jump from 3-7% to over 40% accuracy. Our results demonstrate that targeted, compilerguided repair of LLM outputs yields dramatic gains in both efficiency and correctness, suggesting a general paradigm for scalable automated theorem proving.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in hands-free scenarios. To address this issue, we propose replacing text with speech as the instruction input modality for GUI agents, and introduce UITron-Speech, which is the first end-to-end GUI agent capable of directly processing speech instructions and on-device screenshots to predict user actions. To tackle the problem of data scarcity, we synthesize high-quality speech instruction datasets using a random-speaker text-to-speech model. Additionally, we design a mixed-modality training strategy to mitigate the inherent modality imbalance in pre-trained foundation models. Furthermore, we conduct a statistical analysis of the distribution of GUI grounding prediction errors and propose a training-free two-step grounding refinement method to alleviate minor localization deviations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UITron-Speech achieves robust performance and superior adaptability, underscoring the feasibility and potential of speech-driven GUI agents for more accessible and intelligent human-computer interaction.

Abstract: A major challenge in developing robust and generalizable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems for smart homes is the lack of large and diverse labeled datasets. Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents-virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.

Abstract: Random experiments that are simple and clear enough to be performed by human agents feature prominently in the teaching of elementary stochastics as well as in games.  We present Alea, a domain-specific language for the specification of random experiments.  Alea code can either be analyzed statically to obtain and inspect probability distributions of outcomes, or be executed with a source pseudo-randomness for simulation or as a game assistant.  The language is intended for ease of use by non-expert programmers, in particular students of elementary stochastics, and players and designers of games of chance, by focusing on concepts common to functional programming and basic mathematics.  Both the design of the language and the implementation of runtime environments are work in progress.

Abstract: Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems. Code and data are released under [this https URL](https://github.com/AI45Lab/IS-Bench).

Abstract: A unit ball graph consists of a set of vertices, labeled by points in Euclidean space, and edges joining all pairs of points within distance 1. These geometric graphs are used to model a variety of spatial networks, including communication networks between agents in an autonomous swarm. In such an application, vertices and/or edges of the graph may not be perfectly reliable; an agent may experience failure or a communication link rendered inoperable. With the goal of designing robust swarm formations, or unit ball graphs with high reliability (probability of connectedness), in a preliminary conference paper we provided an algorithm with cubic time complexity to determine all possible changes to a unit ball graph by repositioning a single vertex. Using this algorithm and Monte Carlo simulations, one obtains an efficient method to modify a unit ball graph by moving a single vertex to a location which maximizes the reliability. Another important consideration in many swarm missions is area coverage, yet highly reliable ball graphs often contain clusters of vertices. Here, we generalize our previous algorithm to improve area coverage as well as reliability. Our algorithm determines a location to add or move a vertex within a unit ball graph which maximizes the reliability, under the constraint that no other vertices of the graph be within some fixed distance. We compare this method of obtaining graphs with high reliability and evenly distributed area coverage to another method which uses a modified Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for ball graphs.

Abstract: We introduce RoboBrain 2.0, our latest generation of embodied vision-language foundation models, designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for complex embodied tasks in physical environments. It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents. The code, checkpoint and benchmark are available at https://superrobobrain.github.io.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems introduce unprecedented security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional content generation attacks to system-level compromise. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the security of LLMs used as reasoning engines within autonomous agents, highlighting how they can be exploited as attack vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover. We focus on how different attack surfaces and trust boundaries - Direct Prompt Injection, RAG Backdoor, and Inter Agent Trust - can be leveraged to orchestrate such takeovers. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming scenario: 94.4% of models succumb to Direct Prompt Injection and 83.3% are vulnerable to the more stealth and evasive RAG Backdoor Attack. Notably, we tested trust boundaries within multi-agent systems, where LLM agents interact and influence each other, and we revealed a critical security flaw: LLMs which successfully resist direct injection or RAG backdoor will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents. Our findings show that 100.0% of tested LLMs can be compromised through Inter-Agent Trust Exploitation attacks and that every model exhibits context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our results also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.

Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process that enables logical inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reasoning has emerged as a key capability that distinguishes advanced AI systems from conventional models that empower chatbots. In this survey, we categorize existing methods along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) Regimes, which define the stage at which reasoning is achieved (either at inference time or through dedicated training); and (2) Architectures, which determine the components involved in the reasoning process, distinguishing between standalone LLMs and agentic compound systems that incorporate external tools, and multi-agent collaborations. Within each dimension, we analyze two key perspectives: (1) Input level, which focuses on techniques that construct high-quality prompts that the LLM condition on; and (2) Output level, which methods that refine multiple sampled candidates to enhance reasoning quality. This categorization provides a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape of LLM reasoning, highlighting emerging trends such as the shift from inference-scaling to learning-to-reason (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and the transition to agentic workflows (e.g., OpenAI Deep Research, Manus Agent). Additionally, we cover a broad spectrum of learning algorithms, from supervised fine-tuning to reinforcement learning such as PPO and GRPO, and the training of reasoners and verifiers. We also examine key designs of agentic workflows, from established patterns like generator-evaluator and LLM debate to recent innovations. ...

<title>LLM Agent-Based Simulation of Student Activities and Mental Health Using Smartphone Sensing Data</title>

Abstract: Students' mental well-being is vital for academic success, with activities such as studying, socializing, and sleeping playing a role. Current mobile sensing data highlight this intricate link using statistical and machine learning analyses. We propose a novel LLM agent-based simulation framework to model student activities and mental health using the StudentLife Dataset. Each LLM agent was initialized with personality questionnaires and guided by smartphone sensing data throughout the simulated semester. These agents predict individual behaviors, provide self-reported mental health data via ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), and complete follow-up personality questionnaires. To ensure accuracy, we investigated various prompting techniques, memory systems, and activity-based mental state management strategies that dynamically update an agent's mental state based on their daily activities. This simulation goes beyond simply replicating existing data. This allows us to explore new scenarios that are not present in the original dataset, such as peer influence through agent-to-agent interactions and the impact of social media. Furthermore, we can conduct intervention studies by manipulating activity patterns via sensing signals and personality traits using questionnaire responses. This provides valuable insights into the behavioral changes that could enhance student well-being. The framework also facilitates hypothetical interviews with LLM agents, offering deeper insights into their mental health. This study showcases the power of LLM-driven behavioral modeling with sensing data, opening new avenues for understanding and supporting student mental health.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains 96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4% improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

<title>Blueprint First, Model Second: A Framework for Deterministic LLM Workflow</title>

Abstract: While powerful, the inherent non-determinism of large language model (LLM) agents limits their application in structured operational environments where procedural fidelity and predictable execution are strict requirements. This limitation stems from current architectures that conflate probabilistic, high-level planning with low-level action execution within a single generative process. To address this, we introduce the Source Code Agent framework, a new paradigm built on the "Blueprint First, Model Second" philosophy. Our framework decouples the workflow logic from the generative model. An expert-defined operational procedure is first codified into a source code-based Execution Blueprint, which is then executed by a deterministic engine. The LLM is strategically invoked as a specialized tool to handle bounded, complex sub-tasks within the workflow, but never to decide the workflow's path. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the challenging tau-bench benchmark, designed for complex user-tool-rule scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the Source Code Agent establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the strongest baseline by 10.1 percentage points on the average Pass^1 score while dramatically improving execution efficiency. Our work enables the verifiable and reliable deployment of autonomous agents in applications governed by strict procedural logic.

Abstract: Proof-oriented programming languages (POPLs) empower developers to write code alongside formal correctness proofs, providing formal guarantees that the code adheres to specified requirements. Despite their powerful capabilities, POPLs present a steep learning curve and have not yet been adopted by the broader software community. The lack of understanding about the proof-development process and how expert proof developers interact with POPLs has hindered the advancement of effective proof engineering and the development of proof-synthesis models/tools.
  In this work, we conduct a user study, involving the collection and analysis of fine-grained source code telemetry from eight experts working with two languages, F* and Verus. Results reveal interesting trends and patterns about how experts reason about proofs and key challenges encountered during the proof development process. We identify three distinct strategies and multiple informal practices that are not captured final code snapshots, yet are predictive of task outcomes. We translate these findings into concrete design guidance for AI proof assistants: bias toward early specification drafting, explicit sub-goal decomposition, bounded active errors, and disciplined verifier interaction. We also present a case study of an F* proof agent grounded in these recommendations, and demonstrate improved performance over baseline LLMs

<title>AgentSight: System-Level Observability for AI Agents Using eBPF</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02736</link>

Abstract: Modern software infrastructure increasingly relies on LLM agents for development and maintenance, such as Claude Code and Gemini-cli. However, these AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures. We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3% performance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection attacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden coordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems. AgentSight is released as an open-source project at https://github.com/agent-sight/agentsight.

Abstract: In everyday life, people make countless reasonableness judgments that determine appropriate behavior in various contexts. Predicting these judgments challenges the legal system, as judges' intuitions may not align with broader societal views. This Article investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can learn to identify patterns driving human reasonableness judgments.
  Using randomized controlled trials comparing humans and models across multiple legal contexts with over 10,000 simulated judgments, we demonstrate that certain models capture not just surface-level responses but potentially their underlying decisional architecture. Strikingly, these systems prioritize social cues over economic efficiency in negligence determinations, mirroring human behavior despite contradicting textbook treatments.
  These findings suggest practical applications: judges could calibrate intuitions against broader patterns, lawmakers could test policy interpretations, and resource-constrained litigants could preview argument reception. As AI agents increasingly make autonomous real-world decisions, understanding whether they've internalized recognizable ethical frameworks becomes essential for anticipating their behavior.

Abstract: The convergence of Web3 technologies and AI agents represents a rapidly evolving frontier poised to reshape decentralized ecosystems. This paper presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics, governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3 governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing (RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust, intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent interactions.

Abstract: Radiological imaging is central to diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical decision-making. Vision-language foundation models have spurred interest in automated radiology report generation (RRG), but safe deployment requires reliable clinical evaluation of generated reports. Existing metrics often rely on surface-level similarity or behave as black boxes, lacking interpretability. We introduce ICARE (Interpretable and Clinically-grounded Agent-based Report Evaluation), an interpretable evaluation framework leveraging large language model agents and dynamic multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Two agents, each with either the ground-truth or generated report, generate clinically meaningful questions and quiz each other. Agreement on answers captures preservation and consistency of findings, serving as interpretable proxies for clinical precision and recall. By linking scores to question-answer pairs, ICARE enables transparent, and interpretable assessment. Clinician studies show ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment than prior metrics. Perturbation analyses confirm sensitivity to clinical content and reproducibility, while model comparisons reveal interpretable error patterns.

Abstract: Agent modeling is a critical component in developing effective policies within multi-agent systems, as it enables agents to form beliefs about the behaviors, intentions, and competencies of others. Many existing approaches assume access to other agents' episodic trajectories, a condition often unrealistic in real-world applications. Consequently, a practical agent modeling approach must learn a robust representation of the policies of the other agents based only on the local trajectory of the controlled agent. In this paper, we propose \texttt{TransAM}, a novel transformer-based agent modeling approach to encode local trajectories into an embedding space that effectively captures the policies of other agents. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in cooperative, competitive, and mixed multi-agent environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach generates strong policy representations, improves agent modeling, and leads to higher episodic returns.

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA, they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding, multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability. This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex reasoning.

Abstract: Foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used as core components of AI agents in complex, large-scale workflows across federated and heterogeneous environments. In agentic workflows, autonomous agents plan tasks, interact with humans and peers, and shape scientific outcomes. This makes transparency, traceability, reproducibility, and reliability essential. However, AI-based agents can hallucinate or reason incorrectly, and their decisions may propagate errors through the workflow, especially when one agent's output feeds into another's input. Therefore, fine-grained provenance is essential to link agent decisions, their end-to-end context, and downstream impacts. While provenance techniques have long supported reproducibility and workflow data understanding, they fail to capture and relate agent-centric metadata (prompts, responses, and decisions) with the rest of the workflow. In this paper, we introduce PROV-AGENT, a provenance model that extends W3C PROV and leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to integrate agent interactions into end-to-end workflow provenance. Our contributions include: (1) a provenance model tailored for agentic workflows, (2) a near real-time, open-source system for capturing agentic provenance, and (3) a cross-facility evaluation spanning edge, cloud, and HPC environments, demonstrating support for critical provenance queries and agent reliability analysis.

<title>Seemingly Simple Planning Problems are Computationally Challenging: The Countdown Game</title>

Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: We compare the efficacy of learned versus engineered communication strategies in a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment. For the learned approach, we introduce Learned Direct Communication (LDC), where agents generate messages and actions concurrently via a neural network. Our engineered approach, Intention Communication, employs an Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM) and a Message Generation Network (MGN) to formulate messages based on predicted future states. Both strategies are evaluated on their success rates in cooperative tasks under fully and partially observable conditions. Our findings indicate that while emergent communication is viable, the engineered approach demonstrates superior performance and scalability, particularly as environmental complexity increases.

Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model (LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft. LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models, suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be confidently used in sensitive production environments.

<title>AQUAH: Automatic Quantification and Unified Agent in Hydrology</title>

Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to 2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear, transparent, and physically plausible. While further calibration and validation are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data, physics-based tools, and decision makers.

<title>LMDG: Advancing Lateral Movement Detection Through High-Fidelity Dataset Generation</title>

Abstract: Lateral Movement (LM) attacks continue to pose a significant threat to enterprise security, enabling adversaries to stealthily compromise critical assets. However, the development and evaluation of LM detection systems are impeded by the absence of realistic, well-labeled datasets. To address this gap, we propose LMDG, a reproducible and extensible framework for generating high-fidelity LM datasets. LMDG automates benign activity generation, multi-stage attack execution, and comprehensive labeling of system and network logs, dramatically reducing manual effort and enabling scalable dataset creation. A central contribution of LMDG is Process Tree Labeling, a novel agent-based technique that traces all malicious activity back to its origin with high precision. Unlike prior methods such as Injection Timing or Behavioral Profiling, Process Tree Labeling enables accurate, step-wise labeling of malicious log entries, correlating each with a specific attack step and MITRE ATT\&amp;CK TTPs. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to support fine-grained labeling of multi-step attacks, providing critical context for detection models such as attack path reconstruction. We used LMDG to generate a 25-day dataset within a 25-VM enterprise environment containing 22 user accounts. The dataset includes 944 GB of host and network logs and embeds 35 multi-stage LM attacks, with malicious events comprising less than 1% of total activity, reflecting a realistic benign-to-malicious ratio for evaluating detection systems. LMDG-generated datasets improve upon existing ones by offering diverse LM attacks, up-to-date attack patterns, longer attack timeframes, comprehensive data sources, realistic network architectures, and more accurate labeling.

Abstract: Indoor air quality plays an essential role in the safety and well-being of occupants, especially in the context of airborne diseases. This paper introduces AeroSafe, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficacy of indoor air purification systems through a robotic cough emulator testbed and a digital-twins-based aerosol residence time analysis. Current portable air filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a maneuverable mannequin simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to aerosols. The generated data from this emulator trains a digital twins model, combining a physics-based compartment model with a machine learning approach, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and graph convolution layers. Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to predict aerosol concentration dynamics with a mean residence time prediction error within 35 seconds. The proposed system's real-time intervention strategies outperform static air filter placement, showcasing its potential in mitigating airborne pathogen risks.

Abstract: Well-trained multi-agent systems can fail when deployed in real-world environments due to model mismatches between the training and deployment environments, caused by environment uncertainties including noise or adversarial attacks. Distributionally Robust Markov Games (DRMGs) enhance system resilience by optimizing for worst-case performance over a defined set of environmental uncertainties. However, current methods are limited by their dependence on simulators or large offline datasets, which are often unavailable. This paper pioneers the study of online learning in DRMGs, where agents learn directly from environmental interactions without prior data. We introduce the {\it Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (RONAVI)} algorithm and provide the first provable guarantees for this setting. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves low regret and efficiently finds the optimal robust policy for uncertainty sets measured by Total Variation divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence. These results establish a new, practical path toward developing truly robust multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations. Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath, a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding, math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Mobility Control of gNBs in Dynamic Radio Access Networks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02960</link>

arXiv:2508.02960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of wireless environments, characterized by user mobility and dynamic obstructions, poses challenges for the maintenance of Line-of-Sight (LoS) connectivity. Mobile base stations (gNBs) stand as a promising solution by physically relocating to restore or sustain LoS, thereby necessitating the development of intelligent algorithms for autonomous movement control.
  As part of the CONVERGE research project, which is developing an experimental chamber to integrate computer vision (CV) into mobile networks and enhance Quality of Service (QoS) in dynamic wireless environments, this paper presents two key contributions. First, we introduce the CONVERGE Chamber Simulator (CC-SIM), a 3D simulation environment for developing, training, and validating mobility control algorithms for mobile gNBs. CC-SIM models user and obstacle mobility, visual occlusion, and Radio Frequency (RF) propagation behavior. It supports both offline reinforcement learning and real-time testing through tight integration with a standalone 5G system via the OpenAirInterface (OAI) RF simulator, enabling validation under realistic network conditions.
  Second, leveraging CC-SIM, we develop a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent that learns to reposition the gNB proactively in response to dynamic environmental changes. Experiments across three representative use cases show that the trained agent significantly reduces LoS blockage time - by up to 42% - when compared to static deployments. These results highlight the effectiveness of learning-based mobility control in adaptive next-generation wireless networks.

<title>When AIs Judge AIs: The Rise of Agent-as-a-Judge Evaluation for LLMs</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for next-generation LLMs.

Abstract: AGENTiGraph is a user-friendly, agent-driven system that enables intuitive interaction and management of domain-specific data through the manipulation of knowledge graphs in natural language. It gives non-technical users a complete, visual solution to incrementally build and refine their knowledge bases, allowing multi-round dialogues and dynamic updates without specialized query languages. The flexible design of AGENTiGraph, including intent classification, task planning, and automatic knowledge integration, ensures seamless reasoning between diverse tasks. Evaluated on a 3,500-query benchmark within an educational scenario, the system outperforms strong zero-shot baselines (achieving 95.12% classification accuracy, 90.45% execution success), indicating potential scalability to compliance-critical or multi-step queries in legal and medical domains, e.g., incorporating new statutes or research on the fly. Our open-source demo offers a powerful new paradigm for multi-turn enterprise knowledge management that bridges LLMs and structured graphs.

Abstract: Issue localization, the process of identifying code locations that need modification to resolve software issues, is a critical yet challenging task in software development. The semantic gap between natural language issue descriptions and faulty code requires complex multi-hop reasoning through code dependencies. Existing LLM-based agents attempt to address this by integrating repository retrieval tools. However, this transforms issue localization into a demanding task we call Repo Deep Search, which requires the LLM to effectively utilize various repository retrieval tools throughout a multi-step reasoning and navigation process. To tackle this challenge, we present ToolTrain, a two-stage tool-integrated training framework combining rejection-sampled supervised fine-tuning and tool-integrated reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' ability to use retrieval tools for issue localization. Experimental results show that ToolTrain-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance, with our 32B model even surpassing Claude-3.7 on function-level localization. The results also show that improved localization performance translates to better end-to-end issue resolution performance. This further demonstrates that training for issue localization is a viable and effective strategy for improving automated software development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, and their integration with Extended Reality (XR) is poised to transform how users interact with immersive environments. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent developments at the intersection of LLMs and XR, offering a structured organization of research along both technical and application dimensions. We propose a taxonomy of LLM-enhanced XR systems centered on key technical paradigms -- such as interactive agent control, XR development toolkits, and generative scene synthesis -- and discuss how these paradigms enable novel capabilities in XR. In parallel, we examine how LLM-driven techniques support practical XR applications across diverse domains, including immersive education, clinical healthcare, and industrial manufacturing. By connecting these technical paradigms with application frontiers, our survey highlights current trends, delineates design considerations, and identifies open challenges in building LLM-augmented XR systems. This work provides insights that can guide researchers and practitioners in advancing the state of the art in intelligent XR experiences.

<title>Beyond Policy Optimization: A Data Curation Flywheel for Sparse-Reward Long-Horizon Planning</title>

arXiv:2508.03018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework (bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in agentic planning.

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies. Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across different instance sets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning (ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios. Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance than existing baseline methods.

Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and 3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed visual information while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: A typical human strategy for giving navigation guidance is to sketch route maps based on the environmental layout. Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch map-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an agent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch map as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale dataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71 indoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying levels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their preservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future research. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline that efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve SkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual observations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a Ray-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature representation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To improve alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor (DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site constructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide navigation. SkeNavigator outperforms prior floor plan navigation methods by a large margin, improving SPL on the high-abstract validation set by 105% relatively. Our code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics, quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency, and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

Abstract: As As autonomous AI agents scale across cloud, enterprise, and decentralized environments, the need for standardized registry systems to support discovery, identity, and capability sharing has become essential. This paper surveys three prominent registry approaches each defined by a unique metadata model: MCP's mcp.json, A2A's Agent Card, and NANDA's AgentFacts. MCP uses a centralized metaregistry with GitHub authenticated publishing and structured metadata for server discovery. A2A enables decentralized interaction via JSON-based Agent Cards, discoverable through well-known URIs, curated catalogs, or direct configuration. NANDA Index introduces AgentFacts, a cryptographically verifiable and privacy-preserving metadata model designed for dynamic discovery, credentialed capabilities, and cross-domain interoperability. These approaches are compared across four dimensions: security, scalability, authentication, and maintainability. The paper concludes with suggestions and recommendations to guide future design and adoption of registry systems for the Internet of AI Agents.

Abstract: The proliferation of autonomous AI agents represents a paradigmatic shift from traditional web architectures toward collaborative intelligent systems requiring sophisticated mechanisms for discovery, authentication, capability verification, and secure collaboration across heterogeneous protocol environments. This paper presents a comprehensive framework addressing the fundamental infrastructure requirements for secure, trustworthy, and interoperable AI agent ecosystems. We introduce the NANDA (Networked AI Agents in a Decentralized Architecture) framework, providing global agent discovery, cryptographically verifiable capability attestation through AgentFacts, and cross-protocol interoperability across Anthropic's Modal Context Protocol (MCP), Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Microsoft's NLWeb, and standard HTTPS communications. NANDA implements Zero Trust Agentic Access (ZTAA) principles, extending traditional Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) to address autonomous agent security challenges including capability spoofing, impersonation attacks, and sensitive data leakage. The framework defines Agent Visibility and Control (AVC) mechanisms enabling enterprise governance while maintaining operational autonomy and regulatory compliance. Our approach transforms isolated AI agents into an interconnected ecosystem of verifiable, trustworthy intelligent services, establishing foundational infrastructure for large-scale autonomous agent deployment across enterprise and consumer environments. This work addresses the critical gap between current AI agent capabilities and infrastructure requirements for secure, scalable, multi-agent collaboration, positioning the foundation for next-generation autonomous intelligent systems.

Abstract: Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo, Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations.

<title>NANDA Adaptive Resolver: Architecture for Dynamic Resolution of AI Agent Names</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03113</link>

Abstract: AdaptiveResolver is a dynamic microservice architecture designed to address the limitations of static endpoint resolution for AI agent communication in distributed, heterogeneous environments. Unlike traditional DNS or static URLs, AdaptiveResolver enables context-aware, real-time selection of communication endpoints based on factors such as geographic location, system load, agent capabilities, and security threats. Agents advertise their Agent Name and context requirements through Agent Fact cards in an Agent Registry/Index. A requesting Agent discovers a Target Agent using the registry. The Requester Agent can then resolve the Target Agent Name to obtain a tailored communication channel to the agent based on actual environmental context between the agents. The architecture supports negotiation of trust, quality of service, and resource constraints, facilitating flexible, secure, and scalable agent-to-agent interactions that go beyond the classic client-server model. AdaptiveResolver provides a foundation for robust, future-proof agent communication that can evolve with increasing ecosystem complexity.

<title>Toward a Trustworthy Optimization Modeling Agent via Verifiable Synthetic Data Generation</title>

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM) agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations, multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7 datasets, it achieves the highest accuracy on six and outperforms the next-best algorithm by at least 8 percentage on three of them. Our approach provides a scalable, verifiable, and principled path toward building reliable LLM agents for real-world optimization applications.

<title>Attack the Messages, Not the Agents: A Multi-round Adaptive Stealthy Tampering Framework for LLM-MAS</title>

Abstract: Large language model-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) effectively accomplish complex and dynamic tasks through inter-agent communication, but this reliance introduces substantial safety vulnerabilities. Existing attack methods targeting LLM-MAS either compromise agent internals or rely on direct and overt persuasion, which limit their effectiveness, adaptability, and stealthiness. In this paper, we propose MAST, a Multi-round Adaptive Stealthy Tampering framework designed to exploit communication vulnerabilities within the system. MAST integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with Direct Preference Optimization to train an attack policy model that adaptively generates effective multi-round tampering strategies. Furthermore, to preserve stealthiness, we impose dual semantic and embedding similarity constraints during the tampering process. Comprehensive experiments across diverse tasks, communication architectures, and LLMs demonstrate that MAST consistently achieves high attack success rates while significantly enhancing stealthiness compared to baselines. These findings highlight the effectiveness, stealthiness, and adaptability of MAST, underscoring the need for robust communication safeguards in LLM-MAS.

<title>Distributionally Robust Markov Games with Average Reward</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the formulation of a distributionally robust Markov game (DR-MG) with average rewards, a crucial framework for multi-agent decision-making under uncertainty over extended horizons. Unlike finite-horizon or discounted models, the average-reward criterion naturally captures long-term performance for systems designed for continuous operation, where sustained reliability is paramount. We account for uncertainty in transition kernels, with players aiming to optimize their worst-case average reward. We first establish a connection between the multi-agent and single agent settings, and derive the solvability of the robust Bellman equation under the average-reward formulation. We then rigorously prove the existence of a robust Nash Equilibrium (NE), offering essential theoretical guarantees for system stability. We further develop and analyze an algorithm named robust Nash-Iteration to compute the robust Nash Equilibria among all agents, providing practical tools for identifying optimal strategies in complex, uncertain, and long-running multi-player environments. Finally, we demonstrate the connection between the average-reward NE and the well-studied discounted NEs, showing that the former can be approximated as the discount factor approaches one. Together, these contributions provide a comprehensive theoretical and algorithmic foundation for identifying optimal strategies in complex, uncertain, and long-running multi-player environments, which allow for the future extension of robust average-reward single-agent problems to the multi-agent setting.

<title>Long Story Generation via Knowledge Graph and Literary Theory</title>

Abstract: The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a sub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic that are less appealing to human readers.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it remains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods demonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss. We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

Abstract: Collaborative partnership matters in inquiry-oriented education. However, most study partners are selected either rely on experience-based assignments with little scientific planning or build on rule-based machine assistants, encountering difficulties in knowledge expansion and inadequate flexibility. This paper proposes an LLM-empowered agent model for simulating and selecting learning partners tailored to inquiry-oriented learning, named InqEduAgent. Generative agents are designed to capture cognitive and evaluative features of learners in real-world scenarios. Then, an adaptive matching algorithm with Gaussian process augmentation is formulated to identify patterns within prior knowledge. Optimal learning-partner matches are provided for learners facing different exercises. The experimental results show the optimal performance of InqEduAgent in most knowledge-learning scenarios and LLM environment with different levels of capabilities. This study promotes the intelligent allocation of human-based learning partners and the formulation of AI-based learning partners. The code, data, and appendix are publicly available at https://github.com/InqEduAgent/InqEduAgent.

<title>Scaling DRL for Decision Making: A Survey on Data, Network, and Training Budget Strategies</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the expansion of neural network models and training data has driven remarkable progress in deep learning, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing. This advancement is underpinned by the concept of Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training data enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed breakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and advanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its potential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for decision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by systematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network, and training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data efficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the relationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we investigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions, ensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which collectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational challenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of distributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary training on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these strategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in advancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future research. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with computational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging scaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot control, autonomous driving and LLM training.

Abstract: While commercial metaverse platforms offer diverse user-generated content, they lack effective navigation assistance that can dynamically adapt to users' interests and intentions. Although previous research has investigated on-demand agents in controlled environments, implementation in commercial settings with diverse world configurations and platform constraints remains challenging.
  We present Navigation Pixie, an on-demand navigation agent employing a loosely coupled architecture that integrates structured spatial metadata with LLM-based natural language processing while minimizing platform dependencies, which enables experiments on the extensive user base of commercial metaverse platforms. Our cross-platform experiments on commercial metaverse platform Cluster with 99 PC client and 94 VR-HMD participants demonstrated that Navigation Pixie significantly increased dwell time and free exploration compared to fixed-route and no-agent conditions across both platforms. Subjective evaluations revealed consistent on-demand preferences in PC environments versus context-dependent social perception advantages in VR-HMD. This research contributes to advancing VR interaction design through conversational spatial navigation agents, establishes cross-platform evaluation methodologies revealing environment-dependent effectiveness, and demonstrates empirical experimentation frameworks for commercial metaverse platforms.

Abstract: Embodied Planning is dedicated to the goal of creating agents capable of executing long-horizon tasks in complex physical worlds. However, existing embodied planning benchmarks frequently feature short-horizon tasks and coarse-grained action primitives. To address this challenge, we introduce CookBench, a benchmark for long-horizon planning in complex cooking scenarios. By leveraging a high-fidelity simulation environment built upon the powerful Unity game engine, we define frontier AI challenges in a complex, realistic environment. The core task in CookBench is designed as a two-stage process. First, in Intention Recognition, an agent needs to accurately parse a user's complex intent. Second, in Embodied Interaction, the agent should execute the identified cooking goal through a long-horizon, fine-grained sequence of physical actions. Unlike existing embodied planning benchmarks, we refine the action granularity to a spatial level that considers crucial operational information while abstracting away low-level robotic control. Besides, We provide a comprehensive toolset that encapsulates the simulator. Its unified API supports both macro-level operations, such as placing orders and purchasing ingredients, and a rich set of fine-grained embodied actions for physical interaction, enabling researchers to focus on high-level planning and decision-making. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art, closed-source Large Language Model and Vision-Language Model, revealing their major shortcomings and challenges posed by complex, long-horizon tasks. The full benchmark will be open-sourced to facilitate future research.

Abstract: We study the online fair division problem, where indivisible goods arrive sequentially and must be allocated immediately and irrevocably to agents. Prior work has established strong impossibility results for approximating classic fairness notions, such as envy-freeness and maximin share fairness, in this setting. In contrast, we focus on proportionality up to one good (PROP1), a natural relaxation of proportionality whose approximability remains unresolved. We begin by showing that three natural greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any positive approximation to PROP1 in general, against an adaptive adversary. This is surprising because greedy algorithms are commonly used in fair division and a natural greedy algorithm is known to be able to achieve PROP1 under additional information assumptions. This hardness result motivates the study of non-adaptive adversaries and the use of side-information, in the spirit of learning-augmented algorithms. For non-adaptive adversaries, we show that the simple uniformly random allocation can achieve a meaningful PROP1 approximation with high probability. Meanwhile, we present an algorithm that obtain robust approximation ratios against PROP1 when given predictions of the maximum item value (MIV). Interestingly, we also show that stronger fairness notions such as EF1, MMS, and PROPX remain inapproximable even with perfect MIV predictions.

Abstract: The transition to mixed-traffic environments that involve automated vehicles, manually operated vehicles, and vulnerable road users presents new challenges for human-centered automotive research. Despite this, most studies in the domain focus on single-agent interactions. This paper reports on a participatory workshop (N = 15) and a questionnaire (N = 19) conducted during the AutomotiveUI '24 conference to explore the state of multi-agent automotive research. The participants discussed methodological challenges and opportunities in real-world settings, simulations, and computational modeling. Key findings reveal that while the value of multi-agent approaches is widely recognized, practical and technical barriers hinder their implementation. The study highlights the need for interdisciplinary methods, better tools, and simulation environments that support scalable, realistic, and ethically informed multi-agent research.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We examine hypothesis testing within a principal-agent framework, where a strategic agent, holding private beliefs about the effectiveness of a product, submits data to a principal who decides on approval. The principal employs a hypothesis testing rule, aiming to pick a p-value threshold that balances false positives and false negatives while anticipating the agent's incentive to maximize expected profitability. Building on prior work, we develop a game-theoretic model that captures how the agent's participation and reporting behavior respond to the principal's statistical decision rule. Despite the complexity of the interaction, we show that the principal's errors exhibit clear monotonic behavior when segmented by an efficiently computable critical p-value threshold, leading to an interpretable characterization of their optimal p-value threshold. We empirically validate our model and these insights using publicly available data on drug approvals. Overall, our work offers a comprehensive perspective on strategic interactions within the hypothesis testing framework, providing technical and regulatory insights.

<title>Enhancing Joint Human-AI Inference in Robot Missions: A Confidence-Based Approach</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint human-AI inference holds immense potential to improve outcomes in human-supervised robot missions. Current day missions are generally in the AI-assisted setting, where the human operator makes the final inference based on the AI recommendation. However, due to failures in human judgement on when to accept or reject the AI recommendation, complementarity is rarely achieved. We investigate joint human-AI inference where the inference made with higher confidence is selected. Through a user study with N=100 participants on a representative simulated robot teleoperation task, specifically studying the inference of robots' control delays we show that: a) Joint inference accuracy is higher and its extent is regulated by the confidence calibration of the AI agent, and b) Humans change their inferences based on AI recommendations and the extent and direction of this change is also regulated by the confidence calibration of the AI agent. Interestingly, our results show that pairing poorly-calibrated AI-DSS with humans hurts performance instead of helping the team, reiterating the need for AI-based decision support systems with good metacognitive sensitivity. To the best of our knowledge, our study presents the first application of a maximum-confidence-based heuristic for joint human-AI inference within a simulated robot teleoperation task.

arXiv:2508.03333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra training. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and Self-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model (SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling (STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model (MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance. Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking (PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be released at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second, its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents. Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive, multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

<title>Remini: Leveraging Chatbot-Mediated Mutual Reminiscence for Promoting Positive Affect and Feeling of Connectedness among Loved Ones</title>

Abstract: Mutual reminiscence, defined as revisiting shared positive memories through reciprocal self-disclosure, strengthens emotional bonds, enhances well-being, and deepens intimacy. However, most technology-mediated reminiscence tools emphasize individual reflection or one-way storytelling, which overlooks the dynamic, interactive dialogue essential for meaningful mutual reminiscence. To address this limitation, we introduce Remini, a chatbot designed to support reciprocal self-disclosure between close partners such as couples, friends, or family members. Grounded in the Social Functions of Autobiographical Memory (SFAM) framework, Remini uses conversational AI to guide emotionally rich exchanges through five narrative phases: rapport building, memory narration, elaboration, reflection, and summary. In a mixed-method, both between- and within- subjects study (N = 48, 24 dyads), we compare Remini to a baseline chatbot that offers minimal memory-trigger prompts. Our findings show that structured guidance from Remini significantly improves positive affect, feeling of connection, and engagement. It also fosters more detailed narrative co-construction and greater reciprocal self-disclosure. Participant feedback highlights the practical value, perceived benefits, and design considerations of chatbot-mediated reminiscence. We contribute empirically grounded design implications for conversational agents that strengthen human connection through mutual reminiscence.

To address this, we propose a novel, LLM-driven multi-agent framework that automates the end-to-end workflow from ambiguous requirements to 3D concept model performance validation. The workflow is structured in two stages: conceptual generation and performance validation. In the first stage, agents collaborate to interpret fuzzy design requirements, generate concept sketches, and produce photorealistic renderings using diffusion models. In the second stage, the renderings are converted to 3D point clouds, where a Drag Prediction Agent, built upon a lightweight surrogate model, provides near-instantaneous predictions of the drag coefficient and pressure fields, replacing time-consuming CFD simulations. The primary contribution of this work is the seamless integration of creative generation with a rapid engineering validation loop within a unified, automated system, which provides a new paradigm for efficiently balancing creative exploration with engineering constraints in the earliest stages of design.

Abstract: Social media platforms have been widely linked to societal harms, including rising polarization and the erosion of constructive debate. Can these problems be mitigated through prosocial interventions? We address this question using a novel method - generative social simulation - that embeds Large Language Models within Agent-Based Models to create socially rich synthetic platforms. We create a minimal platform where agents can post, repost, and follow others. We find that the resulting following-networks reproduce three well-documented dysfunctions: (1) partisan echo chambers; (2) concentrated influence among a small elite; and (3) the amplification of polarized voices - creating a 'social media prism' that distorts political discourse. We test six proposed interventions, from chronological feeds to bridging algorithms, finding only modest improvements - and in some cases, worsened outcomes. These results suggest that core dysfunctions may be rooted in the feedback between reactive engagement and network growth, raising the possibility that meaningful reform will require rethinking the foundational dynamics of platform architecture.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI systems in 6G software businesses presents both strategic opportunities and significant challenges. While such systems promise increased autonomy, scalability, and intelligent decision-making across distributed environments, their adoption raises concerns regarding technical immaturity, integration complexity, organizational readiness, and performance-cost trade-offs. In this study, we conducted a preliminary thematic mapping to identify factors influencing the adoption of agentic software within the context of 6G. Drawing on a multivocal literature review and targeted scanning, we identified 29 motivators and 27 demotivators, which were further categorized into five high-level themes in each group. This thematic mapping offers a structured overview of the enabling and inhibiting forces shaping organizational readiness for agentic transformation. Positioned as a feasibility assessment, the study represents an early phase of a broader research initiative aimed at developing and validating a layered maturity model grounded in CMMI model with the software architectural three dimensions possibly Data, Business Logic, and Presentation. Ultimately, this work seeks to provide a practical framework to help software-driven organizations assess, structure, and advance their agent-first capabilities in alignment with the demands of 6G.

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists, remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks. To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e., planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code will be available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/MACT.git.

<title>Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis for Routing Problems Using Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions. Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

<title>Data Overdose? Time for a Quadruple Shot: Knowledge Graph Construction using Enhanced Triple Extraction</title>

Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG) generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming `quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

<title>An Auditable Agent Platform For Automated Molecular Optimisation</title>

Abstract: Drug discovery frequently loses momentum when data, expertise, and tools are scattered, slowing design cycles. To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical, tool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal Researcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target information, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to molecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a docking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic polices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full reasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise provenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule centered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in context learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein using five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking score, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then compared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three configurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an architectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding optimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%. In contrast, single agent runs generated molecules with superior drug like properties at the cost of less potent binding scores. Unguided LLM runs finished fastest, yet their lack of transparent tool signals left the validity of their reasoning paths unverified. These results show that test time scaling, focused feedback loops and provenance convert general purpose LLMs into auditable systems for molecular design, and suggest that extending the toolset to ADMET and selectivity predictors could push research workflows further along the discovery pipeline.

<title>Training Long-Context, Multi-Turn Software Engineering Agents with Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2508.03501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE), which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.
  To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to 39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based on open models.

Abstract: The variable and unpredictable load demands in hybrid agricultural tractors make it difficult to design optimal rule-based energy management strategies, motivating the use of adaptive, learning-based control. However, existing approaches often rely on basic fuel-based rewards and do not leverage expert demonstrations to accelerate training. In this paper, first, the performance of Q-value-based reinforcement learning algorithms is evaluated for powertrain control in a hybrid agricultural tractor. Three algorithms, Double Q-Learning (DQL), Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and Double DQN (DDQN), are compared in terms of convergence speed and policy optimality. Second, a piecewise domain-specific reward-shaping strategy is introduced to improve learning efficiency and steer agent behavior toward engine fuel-efficient operating regions. Third, the design of the experience replay buffer is examined, with a focus on the effects of seeding the buffer with expert demonstrations and analyzing how different types of expert policies influence convergence dynamics and final performance. Experimental results demonstrate that (1) DDQN achieves 70\% faster convergence than DQN in this application domain, (2) the proposed reward shaping method effectively biases the learned policy toward fuel-efficient outcomes, and (3) initializing the replay buffer with structured expert data leads to a 33\% improvement in convergence speed.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models have provided blind or visually impaired (BVI) individuals with new capabilities to interpret and engage with the real world through interactive systems that utilize live video feeds. However, the potential benefits and challenges of such capabilities to support diverse real-world assistive tasks remain unclear. In this paper, we present findings from an exploratory study with eight BVI participants. Participants used ChatGPT's Advanced Voice with Video, a state-of-the-art live video AI released in late 2024, in various real-world scenarios, from locating objects to recognizing visual landmarks, across unfamiliar indoor and outdoor environments. Our findings indicate that current live video AI effectively provides guidance and answers for static visual scenes but falls short in delivering essential live descriptions required in dynamic situations. Despite inaccuracies in spatial and distance information, participants leveraged the provided visual information to supplement their mobility strategies. Although the system was perceived as human-like due to high-quality voice interactions, assumptions about users' visual abilities, hallucinations, generic responses, and a tendency towards sycophancy led to confusion, distrust, and potential risks for BVI users. Based on the results, we discuss implications for assistive video AI agents, including incorporating additional sensing capabilities for real-world use, determining appropriate intervention timing beyond turn-taking interactions, and addressing ecological and safety concerns.

<title>Efficient Morphology-Aware Policy Transfer to New Embodiments</title>

Abstract: Morphology-aware policy learning is a means of enhancing policy sample efficiency by aggregating data from multiple agents. These types of policies have previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb configuration variations between agent morphologies. Unfortunately, these policies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end finetuning on morphologies at deployment. This limitation has ramifications in practical applications such as robotics because further data collection to perform end-to-end finetuning can be computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate combining morphology-aware pretraining with parameter efficient finetuning (PEFT) techniques to help reduce the learnable parameters necessary to specialize a morphology-aware policy to a target embodiment. We compare directly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix tuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT techniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the number of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models end-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of total parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot performance of the base pretrained a policy.

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs, coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance. The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with respect to those contracts.

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent training and deployment.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems face increasing susceptibility to advanced beam-stealing attacks, posing a significant physical layer security threat. This paper introduces a novel framework employing an advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent for proactive and adaptive defense against these sophisticated attacks. A key innovation is leveraging Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) capabilities for active, intelligent threat assessment. The DRL agent, built on a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, dynamically controls ISAC probing actions to investigate suspicious activities. We introduce an intensive curriculum learning strategy that guarantees the agent experiences successful detection during training to overcome the complex exploration challenges inherent to such a security-critical task. Consequently, the agent learns a robust and adaptive policy that intelligently balances security and communication performance. Numerical results demonstrate that our framework achieves a mean attacker detection rate of 92.8% while maintaining an average user SINR of over 13 dB.

Abstract: Conventional machine learning approaches accelerate inorganic materials design via accurate property prediction and targeted material generation, yet they operate as single-shot models limited by the latent knowledge baked into their training data. A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle, from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results, and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives. SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps, including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization, embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically meaningful, and creative inorganic materials hypotheses beyond existing materials knowledge.

Abstract: In cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL), centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) has recently attracted more attention due to the physical demand. However, the most dilemma therein is the inconsistency between jointly-trained policies and individually-executed actions. In this article, we propose a factorized Tchebycheff value-decomposition optimization (TVDO) method to overcome the trouble of inconsistency. In particular, a nonlinear Tchebycheff aggregation function is formulated to realize the global optimum by tightly constraining the upper bound of individual action-value bias, which is inspired by the Tchebycheff method of multi-objective optimization. We theoretically prove that, under no extra limitations, the factorized value decomposition with Tchebycheff aggregation satisfies the sufficiency and necessity of Individual-Global-Max (IGM), which guarantees the consistency between the global and individual optimal action-value function. Empirically, in the climb and penalty game, we verify that TVDO precisely expresses the global-to-individual value decomposition with a guarantee of policy consistency. Meanwhile, we evaluate TVDO in the SMAC benchmark, and extensive experiments demonstrate that TVDO achieves a significant performance superiority over some SOTA MARL baselines.

Abstract: Computational models of purposeful behavior comprise both descriptive and prescriptive aspects, used respectively to ascertain and evaluate situations in the world. In reinforcement learning, prescriptive reward functions are assumed to depend on predefined and fixed descriptive state representations. Alternatively, these two aspects may emerge interdependently: goals can shape the acquired state representations and vice versa. Here, we present a computational framework for state representation learning in bounded agents, where descriptive and prescriptive aspects are coupled through the notion of goal-directed, or telic, states. We introduce the concept of telic-controllability to characterize the tradeoff between the granularity of a telic state representation and the policy complexity required to reach all telic states. We propose an algorithm for learning telic-controllable state representations, illustrating it using a simulated navigation task. Our framework highlights the role of deliberate ignorance -- knowing what to ignore -- for learning state representations that balance goal flexibility and cognitive complexity.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) requires the agent to finish a given task while obeying specific constraints. Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.

Abstract: Despite the prevalence of sleep-tracking devices, many individuals struggle to translate data into actionable improvements in sleep health. Current methods often provide data-driven suggestions but may not be feasible and adaptive to real-life constraints and individual contexts. We present HealthGuru, a novel large language model-powered chatbot to enhance sleep health through data-driven, theory-guided, and adaptive recommendations with conversational behavior change support. HealthGuru's multi-agent framework integrates wearable device data, contextual information, and a contextual multi-armed bandit model to suggest tailored sleep-enhancing activities. The system facilitates natural conversations while incorporating data-driven insights and theoretical behavior change techniques. Our eight-week in-the-wild deployment study with 16 participants compared HealthGuru to a baseline chatbot. Results show improved metrics like sleep duration and activity scores, higher quality responses, and increased user motivation for behavior change with HealthGuru. We also identify challenges and design considerations for personalization and user engagement in health chatbots.

Abstract: This benchmark suite provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing both individual LLMs and multi-agent systems in Real-world planning and scheduling scenarios. The suite encompasses 14 designed planning and scheduling problems that progress from basic to highly complex, incorporating key aspects such as multi-agent coordination, inter-agent dependencies, and dynamic environmental disruptions.

Abstract: Automatic medical report generation has the potential to support clinical diagnosis, reduce the workload of radiologists, and demonstrate potential for enhancing diagnostic consistency. However, current evaluation metrics often fail to reflect the clinical reliability of generated reports. Early overlap-based methods focus on textual matches between predicted and ground-truth entities but miss fine-grained clinical details (e.g., anatomical location, severity). Some diagnostic metrics are limited by fixed vocabularies or templates, reducing their ability to capture diverse clinical expressions. LLM-based approaches further lack interpretable reasoning steps, making it hard to assess or trust their behavior in safety-critical settings. These limitations hinder the comprehensive assessment of the reliability of generated reports and pose risks in their selection for clinical use. Therefore, we propose a Granular Explainable Multi-Agent Score (GEMA-Score) in this paper, which conducts both objective quantification and subjective evaluation through a large language model-based multi-agent workflow. Our GEMA-Score parses structured reports and employs stable calculations through interactive exchanges of information among agents to assess disease diagnosis, location, severity, and uncertainty. Additionally, an LLM-based scoring agent evaluates completeness, readability, and clinical terminology while providing explanatory feedback. Extensive experiments validate that GEMA-Score achieves the highest correlation with human expert evaluations on a public dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in clinical scoring (Kendall coefficient = $0.69$ for ReXVal dataset and Kendall coefficient = $0.45$ for RadEvalX dataset). The anonymous project demo is available at: https://github.com/Zhenxuan-Zhang/GEMA_score.

Abstract: With the advancement of web techniques, they have significantly revolutionized various aspects of people's lives. Despite the importance of the web, many tasks performed on it are repetitive and time-consuming, negatively impacting overall quality of life. To efficiently handle these tedious daily tasks, one of the most promising approaches is to advance autonomous agents based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, referred to as AI Agents, as they can operate continuously without fatigue or performance degradation. In the context of the web, leveraging AI Agents -- termed WebAgents -- to automatically assist people in handling tedious daily tasks can dramatically enhance productivity and efficiency. Recently, Large Foundation Models (LFMs) containing billions of parameters have exhibited human-like language understanding and reasoning capabilities, showing proficiency in performing various complex tasks. This naturally raises the question: `Can LFMs be utilized to develop powerful AI Agents that automatically handle web tasks, providing significant convenience to users?' To fully explore the potential of LFMs, extensive research has emerged on WebAgents designed to complete daily web tasks according to user instructions, significantly enhancing the convenience of daily human life. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies on WebAgents across three key aspects: architectures, training, and trustworthiness. Additionally, several promising directions for future research are explored to provide deeper insights.

Abstract: Reward shaping in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for complex tasks remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often fail to find optimal solutions or cannot efficiently handle such tasks. We propose HYPRL, a specification-guided reinforcement learning framework that learns control policies w.r.t. hyperproperties expressed in HyperLTL. Hyperproperties constitute a powerful formalism for specifying objectives and constraints over sets of execution traces across agents. To learn policies that maximize the satisfaction of a HyperLTL formula $\phi$, we apply Skolemization to manage quantifier alternations and define quantitative robustness functions to shape rewards over execution traces of a Markov decision process with unknown transitions. A suitable RL algorithm is then used to learn policies that collectively maximize the expected reward and, consequently, increase the probability of satisfying $\phi$. We evaluate HYPRL on a diverse set of benchmarks, including safety-aware planning, Deep Sea Treasure, and the Post Correspondence Problem. We also compare with specification-driven baselines to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HYPRL.

Abstract: Test smells reduce test suite reliability and complicate maintenance. While many methods detect test smells, few support automated removal, and most rely on static analysis or machine learning. This study evaluates models with relatively small parameter counts - Llama-3.2-3B, Gemma-2-9B, DeepSeek-R1-14B, and Phi-4-14B - for their ability to detect and refactor test smells using agent-based workflows. We assess workflows with one, two, and four agents over 150 instances of 5 common smells from real-world Java projects. Our approach generalizes to Python, Golang, and JavaScript. All models detected nearly all instances, with Phi-4-14B achieving the best refactoring accuracy (pass@5 of 75.3%). Phi-4-14B with four-agents performed within 5% of proprietary LLMs (single-agent). Multi-agent setups outperformed single-agent ones in three of five smell types, though for Assertion Roulette, one agent sufficed. We submitted pull requests with Phi-4-14B-generated code to open-source projects and six were merged.

Abstract: Scientific knowledge is growing rapidly, making it difficult to track progress and high-level conceptual links across broad disciplines. While tools like citation networks and search engines help retrieve related papers, they lack the abstraction needed to capture the needed to represent the density and structure of activity across subfields.
  We motivate SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY, the goal of organizing scientific literature into a high-quality hierarchical structure that spans multiple levels of abstraction -- from broad domains to specific studies. Such a representation can provide insights into which fields are well-explored and which are under-explored. To achieve this goal, we develop a hybrid approach that combines efficient embedding-based clustering with LLM-based prompting, striking a balance between scalability and semantic precision. Compared to LLM-heavy methods like iterative tree construction, our approach achieves superior quality-speed trade-offs. Our hierarchies capture different dimensions of research contributions, reflecting the interdisciplinary and multifaceted nature of modern science. We evaluate its utility by measuring how effectively an LLM-based agent can navigate the hierarchy to locate target papers. Results show that our method improves interpretability and offers an alternative pathway for exploring scientific literature beyond traditional search methods. Code, data and demo are available: https://github.com/JHU-CLSP/science-hierarchography

Abstract: Multimodality-to-Multiaudio (MM2MA) generation faces significant challenges in synthesizing diverse and contextually aligned audio types (e.g., sound effects, speech, music, and songs) from multimodal inputs (e.g., video, text, images), owing to the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets and the lack of robust multi-task learning frameworks. Recently, multi-agent system shows great potential in tackling the above issues. However, directly applying it to MM2MA task presents three critical challenges: (1) inadequate fine-grained understanding of multimodal inputs (especially for video), (2) the inability of single models to handle diverse audio events, and (3) the absence of self-correction mechanisms for reliable outputs. To this end, we propose AudioGenie, a novel training-free multi-agent system featuring a dual-layer architecture with a generation team and a supervisor team. For the generation team, a fine-grained task decomposition and an adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) collaborative entity are designed for detailed comprehensive multimodal understanding and dynamic model selection, and a trial-and-error iterative refinement module is designed for self-correction. The supervisor team ensures temporal-spatial consistency and verifies outputs through feedback loops. Moreover, we build MA-Bench, the first benchmark for MM2MA tasks, comprising 198 annotated videos with multi-type audios. Experiments demonstrate that our AudioGenie achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) or comparable performance across 9 metrics in 8 tasks. User study further validates the effectiveness of our method in terms of quality, accuracy, alignment, and aesthetic.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks like reasoning or planning, play a substantial role in many cutting-edge commercial applications, and continue to fascinate researchers across nearly all fields for their potential to accomplish expensive, complex tasks that, until recently, only humans have been trusted to do. These workflows depend critically on the prompts used to provide the roles models play in such workflows. Poorly designed prompts that fail even slightly to guide individual agents can lead to sub-optimal performance that may snowball within a system of agents, limiting their reliability and scalability. To address this important problem of inference-time prompt optimization, we introduce ProRefine, an innovative inference-time optimization method that uses an agentic loop of LLMs to generate and apply textual feedback. ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to approach the performance of their larger counterparts. This highlights its potential for building more cost-effective and powerful hybrid AI systems, thereby democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Abstract: An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other methods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be released at https://orangesodahub.github.io/InfGen

Abstract: The ability to extract structured information from unstructured sources-such as free-text documents and scientific literature-is critical for accelerating scientific discovery and knowledge synthesis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, including structured information extraction. However, their effectiveness often diminishes in specialized, domain-specific contexts that require nuanced understanding and expert-level domain knowledge. In addition, existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic, open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs. StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense can overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of cross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse neuroscience information extraction tasks.

Abstract: Most end-to-end autonomous driving methods rely on imitation learning from single expert demonstrations, often leading to conservative and homogeneous behaviors that limit generalization in complex real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second, reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in imitation learning.

Abstract: We seek a computationally efficient model for a collection of time series arising from multiple interacting entities (a.k.a. "agents"). Recent models of temporal patterns across individuals fail to incorporate explicit system-level collective behavior that can influence the trajectories of individual entities. To address this gap in the literature, we present a new hierarchical switching-state model that can be trained in an unsupervised fashion to simultaneously learn both system-level and individual-level dynamics. We employ a latent system-level discrete state Markov chain that provides top-down influence on latent entity-level chains which in turn govern the emission of each observed time series. Recurrent feedback from the observations to the latent chains at both entity and system levels allows recent situational context to inform how dynamics unfold at all levels in bottom-up fashion. We hypothesize that including both top-down and bottom-up influences on group dynamics will improve interpretability of the learned dynamics and reduce error when forecasting. Our hierarchical switching recurrent dynamical model can be learned via closed-form variational coordinate ascent updates to all latent chains that scale linearly in the number of entities. This is asymptotically no more costly than fitting a separate model for each entity. Analysis of both synthetic data and real basketball team movements suggests our lean parametric model can achieve competitive forecasts compared to larger neural network models that require far more computational resources. Further experiments on soldier data as well as a synthetic task with 64 cooperating entities show how our approach can yield interpretable insights about team dynamics over time.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has emerged as a transformative force in financial analysis and the finance industry, though significant questions remain about the full capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in this domain. We present the Finance Agent Benchmark, featuring challenging and diverse real-world finance research problems that require LLMs to perform complex analysis using recent SEC filings. We construct the benchmark using a taxonomy of nine financial task categories, developed in consultation with experts from banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms. The dataset includes 537 expert-authored questions covering tasks from information retrieval to complex financial modeling, each validated through a rigorous review process to ensure accuracy and relevance. Moreover, we implement an agentic harness that equips LLMs with tools sufficient to produce accurate responses, including Google Search and EDGAR database access. Overall, the Finance Agent Benchmark provides a comprehensive testbed for measuring the progress of LLM-driven finance agents. Our evaluation reveals significant limitations in current AI capabilities - even the best-performing model (OpenAI o3) achieved only 46.8% accuracy at an average cost of $3.79 per query. This underscores the need for further advancements before reliable deployment in high-stakes finance settings.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human intervention. Despite their growing presence, a structured framework is lacking to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive and environmental agency in an ordinal structure. Using a multi-phase methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments in agentic AI.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an AI-mediated framework that can provide intelligent feedback to augment human cognition. Specifically, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to provide adaptive time pressure feedback to improve user performance in a math arithmetic task. Time pressure feedback could either improve or deteriorate user performance by regulating user attention and anxiety. Adaptive time pressure feedback controlled by a DRL policy according to users' real-time performance could potentially solve this trade-off problem. However, the DRL training and hyperparameter tuning may require large amounts of data and iterative user studies. Therefore, we propose a dual-DRL framework that trains a regulation DRL agent to regulate user performance by interacting with another simulation DRL agent that mimics user cognition behaviors from an existing dataset. Our user study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the dual-DRL framework in augmenting user performance, in comparison to the baseline group.

Abstract: How do we learn when to persist, when to let go, and when to shift gears? Gearshift Fellowship (GF) is the prototype of a new Supertask paradigm designed to model how humans and artificial agents adapt to shifting environment demands. Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, computational psychiatry, economics, and artificial intelligence, Supertasks combine computational neurocognitive modeling with serious gaming. This creates a dynamic, multi-mission environment engineered to assess mechanisms of adaptive behavior across cognitive and social contexts. Computational parameters explain behavior and probe mechanisms by controlling the game environment. Unlike traditional tasks, GF enables neurocognitive modeling of individual differences across perceptual decisions, learning, and meta-cognitive levels. This positions GF as a flexible testbed for understanding how cognitive-affective control processes, learning styles, strategy use, and motivational shifts adapt across contexts and over time. It serves as an experimental platform for scientists, a phenotype-to-mechanism intervention for clinicians, and a training tool for players aiming to strengthen self-regulated learning, mood, and stress resilience. Online study (n = 60, ongoing) results show that GF recovers effects from traditional neuropsychological tasks (construct validity), uncovers novel patterns in how learning differs across contexts and how clinical features map onto distinct adaptations. These findings pave the way for developing in-game interventions that foster self-efficacy and agency to cope with real-world stress and uncertainty. GF builds a new adaptive ecosystem designed to accelerate science, transform clinical care, and foster individual growth. It offers a mirror and training ground where humans and machines co-develop together deeper flexibility and awareness.

Abstract: This study aims to reinforce the theoretical foundation for diverse systems--including the axiomatic definition of intelligence--by introducing a mathematically rigorous and unified formal structure for the concept of 'state,' which has long been used without consensus or formal clarity. First, a 'hierarchical state grid' composed of two axes--state depth and mapping hierarchy--is proposed to provide a unified notational system applicable across mathematical, physical, and linguistic domains. Next, the 'Intermediate Meta-Universe (IMU)' is introduced to enable explicit descriptions of definers (ourselves) and the languages we use, thereby allowing conscious meta-level operations while avoiding self-reference and logical inconsistency. Building on this meta-theoretical foundation, this study expands inter-universal theory beyond mathematics to include linguistic translation and agent integration, introducing the conceptual division between macrocosm-inter-universal and microcosm-inter-universal operations for broader expressivity. Through these contributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in the principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and operations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the definition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However, existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability. Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks. Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

<title>ff4ERA: A new Fuzzy Framework for Ethical Risk Assessment in AI</title>

Abstract: The emergence of Symbiotic AI (SAI) introduces new challenges to ethical decision-making as it deepens human-AI collaboration. As symbiosis grows, AI systems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust. Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that minimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and incomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise. This motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for ERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and prioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select actions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the FAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a robust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic, step-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields context-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert input and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant factors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis shows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global Sobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and certainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results demonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware ethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in calibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical decision support.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly deployed as local agents on personal devices with CPUs, NPUs and integrated GPUs. However, forecasting inference performance on devices with such heterogeneity remains challenging due to the dynamic compute and memory demands. Existing approaches rely on GPU benchmarking or machine learning-based latency predictors, which are often hardware-specific and lack generalizability. To this end, we introduce LIFE, a lightweight and modular analytical framework that is comprised of modular analytical model of operators, configurable to characterize LLM inference workloads in a hardware and dataset-agnostic manner. LIFE characterizes the influence of software and model optimizations, such as quantization, KV cache compression, LoRA adapters, chunked prefill, different attentions, and operator fusion, on performance metrics such as time-to-first-token (TTFT), time-per-output-token (TPOT) and tokens-per-second (TPS). LIFE enables performance forecasting using only hardware specifications, such as TOPS and memory bandwidth, without requiring extensive dataset benchmarking. We validate LIFE's forecasting with inference on AMD Ryzen CPUs, NPUs, iGPUs and NVIDIA V100 GPUs, with Llama2-7B variants, demonstrating the utility of LIFE in forecasting LLM performance through lens of system efficiency to enable efficient LLM deployment across different hardware platforms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in software engineering tasks when trained with executable runtime environments, particularly in resolving GitHub issues. However, such runtime environments are often unavailable in other domains, especially cybersecurity, where challenge configurations and execution contexts are ephemeral or restricted. We present Cyber-Zero, the first runtime-free framework for synthesizing high-quality agent trajectories to train cybersecurity LLMs. Cyber-Zero leverages publicly available CTF writeups and employs persona-driven LLM simulation to reverse-engineer runtime behaviors and generate realistic, long-horizon interaction sequences without actual environments. Using trajectories synthesized by Cyber-Zero, we train LLM-based agents that achieve up to 13.1% absolute performance gains over baseline models on three prominent CTF benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best model, Cyber-Zero-32B, establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-weight models, matching the capabilities of proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering superior cost-effectiveness, and demonstrating that runtime-free trajectory synthesis can effectively democratize the development of state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents.

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) must simultaneously perform multiple tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation, trajectory prediction, motion prediction, and behaviour prediction, to ensure safe and reliable navigation in complex environments. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.

<title>Beyond Benchmarks: Dynamic, Automatic And Systematic Red-Teaming Agents For Trustworthy Medical Language Models</title>

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) in clinical practice is critical to prevent patient harm and promote trustworthy healthcare applications of AI. However, LLMs are advancing so rapidly that static safety benchmarks often become obsolete upon publication, yielding only an incomplete and sometimes misleading picture of model trustworthiness. We demonstrate that a Dynamic, Automatic, and Systematic (DAS) red-teaming framework that continuously stress-tests LLMs can reveal significant weaknesses of current LLMs across four safety-critical domains: robustness, privacy, bias/fairness, and hallucination. A suite of adversarial agents is applied to autonomously mutate test cases, identify/evolve unsafe-triggering strategies, and evaluate responses, uncovering vulnerabilities in real time without human intervention. Applying DAS to 15 proprietary and open-source LLMs revealed a stark contrast between static benchmark performance and vulnerability under adversarial pressure. Despite a median MedQA accuracy exceeding 80\%, 94\% of previously correct answers failed our dynamic robustness tests. We observed similarly high failure rates across other domains: privacy leaks were elicited in 86\% of scenarios, cognitive-bias priming altered clinical recommendations in 81\% of fairness tests, and we identified hallucination rates exceeding 66\% in widely used models. Such profound residual risks are incompatible with routine clinical practice. By converting red-teaming from a static checklist into a dynamic stress-test audit, DAS red-teaming offers the surveillance that hospitals/regulators/technology vendors require as LLMs become embedded in patient chatbots, decision-support dashboards, and broader healthcare workflows. Our framework delivers an evolvable, scalable, and reliable safeguard for the next generation of medical AI.

Abstract: Computer-using agents (CUAs), which autonomously control computers to perform multi-step actions, might pose significant safety risks if misused. Existing benchmarks mostly evaluate language models' (LMs) safety risks in chatbots or simple tool-usage scenarios, without granting full computer access. To better evaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm consists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling firewalls, leaking confidential information, launching denial-of-service attacks, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox environment and rule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these tasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), not just refusal. We evaluate multiple frontier open-source and proprietary LMs, such as Claude Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2. Surprisingly, even without carefully designed jailbreaking prompts, these frontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate (e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Newer models show higher misuse rates: Claude 3.7 Sonnet succeeds on 15% more tasks than Claude 3.5. While these models are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) in chatbot settings, they behave unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading agentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it also amplifies misuse risks. Benign variants reveal refusals stem from alignment, not capability limits. To mitigate risks, we explore using LMs to monitor CUAs' actions and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs). Monitoring CUAs is significantly harder than chatbot outputs. Monitoring CoTs yields modest gains, with average detection accuracy at only 72%. Even with hierarchical summarization, improvement is limited to 4%. CUAHarm will be released at https://github.com/db-ol/CUAHarm.

<title>Trusted Routing for Blockchain-Empowered UAV Networks via Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Due to the high flexibility and versatility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are leveraged in various fields including surveillance and disaster rescue.However, in UAV networks, routing is vulnerable to malicious damage due to distributed topologies and high dynamics. Hence, ensuring the routing security of UAV networks is challenging. In this paper, we characterize the routing process in a time-varying UAV network with malicious nodes. Specifically, we formulate the routing problem to minimize the total delay, which is an integer linear programming and intractable to solve. Then, to tackle the network security issue, a blockchain-based trust management mechanism (BTMM) is designed to dynamically evaluate trust values and identify low-trust UAVs. To improve traditional practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithms in the blockchain, we propose a consensus UAV update mechanism. Besides, considering the local observability, the routing problem is reformulated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process. Further, a multi-agent double deep Q-network based routing algorithm is designed to minimize the total delay. Finally, simulations are conducted with attacked UAVs and numerical results show that the delay of the proposed mechanism decreases by 13.39$\%$, 12.74$\%$, and 16.6$\%$ than multi-agent proximal policy optimal algorithms, multi-agent deep Q-network algorithms, and methods without BTMM, respectively.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more sophisticated, there is a possibility to harness LLMs to power social media bots. This work investigates the realism of generating LLM-Powered social media bot networks. Through a combination of manual effort, network science and LLMs, we create synthetic bot agent personas, their tweets and their interactions, thereby simulating social media networks. We compare the generated networks against empirical bot/human data, observing that both network and linguistic properties of LLM-Powered Bots differ from Wild Bots/Humans. This has implications towards the detection and effectiveness of LLM-Powered Bots.

<title>MAO-ARAG: Multi-Agent Orchestration for Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

arXiv:2508.01005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In question-answering (QA) systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become pivotal in enhancing response accuracy and reducing hallucination issues. The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing single-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address different types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world queries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost efficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent orchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework. Specifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG modules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and generation agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the appropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for each query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable costs. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement learning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based penalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a reasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate that our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only achieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within acceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on https://github.com/chenyiqun/Agentic-RAG.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing but typically requires a high level of expertise from designers. To lower the entry barrier and improve design efficiency, we present an agent for CAD conceptual design powered by large language models (LLMs). The agent accepts both abstract textual descriptions and freehand sketches as input, engaging in interactive dialogue with users to refine and clarify design requirements through comprehensive requirement analysis. Built upon a novel Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP), the agent generates high-quality CAD modeling code. During the generation process, the agent incorporates iterative visual feedback to improve model quality. Generated design cases are stored in a structured knowledge base, enabling continuous improvement of the agent's code generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD code generation.

<title>Centralized Adaptive Sampling for Reliable Co-Training of Independent Multi-Agent Policies</title>

Abstract: Independent on-policy policy gradient algorithms are widely used for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and no-conflict games, but they are known to converge suboptimally when each agent's policy gradient points toward a suboptimal equilibrium. In this work, we identify a subtler failure mode that arises \textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all agents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of trajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint data distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution. This \textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces inaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In this paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through coordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of policy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive action sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method, Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized behavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint actions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We empirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and demonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently than standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of independent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training runs that converge to an optimal joint policy.

Abstract: Managing connectivity in integrated satellite-terrestrial vehicular networks is critical for 6G, yet is challenged by dynamic conditions and partial observability. This letter introduces the Multi-Agent Actor-Critic with Satellite-Aided Multi-head self-attention (MAAC-SAM), a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that enables vehicles to autonomously manage connectivity across Vehicle-to-Satellite (V2S), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) links. Our key innovation is the integration of a multi-head attention mechanism, which allows for robust state estimation even with fluctuating and limited information sharing among vehicles. The framework further leverages self-imitation learning (SIL) and fingerprinting to improve learning efficiency and real-time decisions. Simulation results, based on realistic SUMO traffic models and 3GPP-compliant configurations, demonstrate that MAAC-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art terrestrial and satellite-assisted baselines by up to 14% in transmission utility and maintains high estimation accuracy across varying vehicle densities and sharing levels.

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) enhances situational awareness of connected and autonomous vehicles by exchanging and combining messages from multiple agents. While prior work has explored adversarial integrity attacks that degrade perceptual accuracy, little is known about CP's robustness against attacks on timeliness (or availability), a safety-critical requirement for autonomous driving. In this paper, we present CP-FREEZER, the first latency attack that maximizes the computation delay of CP algorithms by injecting adversarial perturbation via V2V messages. Our attack resolves several unique challenges, including the non-differentiability of point cloud preprocessing, asynchronous knowledge of the victim's input due to transmission delays, and uses a novel loss function that effectively maximizes the execution time of the CP pipeline. Extensive experiments show that CP-FREEZER increases end-to-end CP latency by over $90\times$, pushing per-frame processing time beyond 3 seconds with a 100% success rate on our real-world vehicle testbed. Our findings reveal a critical threat to the availability of CP systems, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses.

Abstract: We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images, (ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.

Abstract: This study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate structured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultation. Using 145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's eConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2, Claude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to produce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question schemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic autograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3 achieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\%), they consistently generate excessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically important questions under length constraints. Performance varies across specialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as psychiatry and pain medicine. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can enhance structured clinical information exchange between physicians, while highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods that capture a model's ability to prioritize clinically salient information within the time constraints of real-world physician communication.

Abstract: This work-in-progress paper presents SPARC (Systematic Problem Solving and Algorithmic Reasoning for Children), a gamified learning platform designed to enhance engagement and knowledge retention in K-12 STEM education. Traditional approaches often struggle to motivate students or facilitate deep understanding, especially for complex scientific concepts. SPARC addresses these challenges by integrating interactive, narrative-driven gameplay with an artificial intelligence peer agent built on large language models. Rather than simply providing answers, the agent engages students in dialogue and inquiry, prompting them to explain concepts and solve problems collaboratively. The platform's design is grounded in educational theory and closely aligned with state learning standards. Initial classroom pilots utilized a multi-method assessment framework combining pre- and post-tests, in-game analytics, and qualitative feedback from students and teachers. Preliminary findings indicate that SPARC significantly increases student engagement, with most participants reporting greater interest in STEM subjects and moderate gains in conceptual understanding observed in post-test results. Ongoing development focuses on refining the AI agent, expanding curriculum integration, and improving accessibility. These early results demonstrate the potential of combining AI-driven peer support with game-based learning to create inclusive, effective, and engaging educational experiences for K-12 learners.

<title>MARS: A Meta-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Framework for Risk-Aware Multi-Agent Portfolio Management</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated portfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a central challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market conditions. In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware System (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this limitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single monolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent possesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a dedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold, allowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to aggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble. By adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC effectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher returns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall stability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and adaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework achieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral diversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major international stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis, demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria, significantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining competitive returns.

Abstract: In the age of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents have emerged as a powerful paradigm for achieving general intelligence. These agents dynamically leverage tools, memory, and reasoning capabilities to accomplish user-defined goals. As agent systems grow in complexity, agent workflows-structured orchestration frameworks-have become central to enabling scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors. This survey provides a comprehensive review of agent workflow systems, spanning academic frameworks and industrial implementations. We classify existing systems along two key dimensions: functional capabilities (e.g., planning, multi-agent collaboration, external API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles, orchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20 representative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical challenges, and emerging trends. We further address concerns related to workflow optimization strategies and security. Finally, we outline open problems such as standardization and multimodal integration, offering insights for future research at the intersection of agent design, workflow infrastructure, and safe automation.

Abstract: A large portion of real-world data science tasks are complex and require multi-hop web-based interactions: finding appropriate data available on the internet, synthesizing real-time data of various modalities from different locations, and producing summarized analyses. Existing web benchmarks often focus on simplistic interactions, such as form submissions or e-commerce transactions, and often do not require diverse tool-using capabilities required for web based data science. Conversely, traditional data science benchmarks typically concentrate on static, often textually bound datasets and do not assess end-to-end workflows that encompass data acquisition, cleaning, analysis, and insight generation. In response, we introduce WebDS, the first end-to-end web-based data science benchmark. It comprises 870 web-based data science tasks across 29 diverse websites from structured government data portals to unstructured news media, challenging agents to perform complex, multi-step operations requiring the use of tools and heterogeneous data formats that better reflect the realities of modern data analytics. Evaluations of current SOTA LLM agents indicate significant performance gaps in accomplishing these tasks. For instance, Browser Use, which accomplishes 80% of tasks on Web Voyager, successfully completes only 15% of tasks in WebDS, which our analysis suggests is due to new failure modes like poor information grounding, repetitive behavior and shortcut-taking that agents performing WebDS' tasks display. By providing a more robust and realistic testing ground, WebDS sets the stage for significant advances in the development of practically useful LLM-based data science.

<title>SketchAgent: Generating Structured Diagrams from Hand-Drawn Sketches</title>

Abstract: Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering, while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. The benchmark is released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/DiagramAgent/Sketch2Diagram-Benchmark.

<title>AgentArmor: Enforcing Program Analysis on Agent Runtime Trace to Defend Against Prompt Injection</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system. AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that reconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate representations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools & data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with only 3.66% of FPR. Our results demonstrate AgentArmor's ability to detect prompt injection vulnerabilities and enforce fine-grained security constraints.

Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures. Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.

<title>Exploitation Is All You Need... for Exploration</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01287</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments. Conventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained solely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1) Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data; and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over a time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory are present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2). Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not always prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal objectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.

<title>GMAT: Grounded Multi-Agent Clinical Description Generation for Text Encoder in Vision-Language MIL for Whole Slide Image Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01293</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt, capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer datasets.

<title>Idempotent Equilibrium Analysis of Hybrid Workflow Allocation: A Mathematical Schema for Future Work</title>

Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii) derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* = \alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and $\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full automation is precluded whenever $\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI modules rather than competing with them. Finally, we discuss implications for skill development, benchmark design and AI governance, arguing that policies which promote "centaur" human-AI teaming can steer the economy toward the welfare-maximising fixed point.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents is significantly hampered by the profound limitations of existing evaluation benchmarks in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and scalability. To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception, decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the future development of GUI agents.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs), is transforming enterprise ecosystems with autonomous agents that execute complex workflows. Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability, and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across agent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine (DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission revocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in neutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS attacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a practical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that BlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment in production LLM-based MAS environments.

Abstract: We present an autonomous framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate end-to-end business analysis and market report generation. At its core, the system employs specialized agents - Researcher, Reviewer, Writer, and Retriever - that collaborate to analyze data and produce comprehensive reports. These agents learn from real professional consultants' presentation materials at Amazon through in-context learning to replicate professional analytical methodologies. The framework executes a multi-step process: querying databases, analyzing data, generating insights, creating visualizations, and composing market reports. We also introduce a novel LLM-based evaluation system for assessing report quality, which shows alignment with expert human evaluations. Building on these evaluations, we implement an iterative improvement mechanism that optimizes report quality through automated review cycles. Experimental results show that report quality can be improved by both automated review cycles and consultants' unstructured knowledge. In experimental validation, our framework generates detailed 6-page reports in 7 minutes at a cost of approximately \$1. Our work could be an important step to automatically create affordable market insights.

<title>Recognising, Anticipating, and Mitigating LLM Pollution of Online Behavioural Research</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online behavioural research faces an emerging threat as participants increasingly turn to large language models (LLMs) for advice, translation, or task delegation: LLM Pollution. We identify three interacting variants through which LLM Pollution threatens the validity and integrity of online behavioural research. First, Partial LLM Mediation occurs when participants make selective use of LLMs for specific aspects of a task, such as translation or wording support, leading researchers to (mis)interpret LLM-shaped outputs as human ones. Second, Full LLM Delegation arises when agentic LLMs complete studies with little to no human oversight, undermining the central premise of human-subject research at a more foundational level. Third, LLM Spillover signifies human participants altering their behaviour as they begin to anticipate LLM presence in online studies, even when none are involved. While Partial Mediation and Full Delegation form a continuum of increasing automation, LLM Spillover reflects second-order reactivity effects. Together, these variants interact and generate cascading distortions that compromise sample authenticity, introduce biases that are difficult to detect post hoc, and ultimately undermine the epistemic grounding of online research on human cognition and behaviour. Crucially, the threat of LLM Pollution is already co-evolving with advances in generative AI, creating an escalating methodological arms race. To address this, we propose a multi-layered response spanning researcher practices, platform accountability, and community efforts. As the challenge evolves, coordinated adaptation will be essential to safeguard methodological integrity and preserve the validity of online behavioural research.

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

arXiv:2508.01432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous evolution and enhanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have elevated their role in complex tasks, notably in travel planning, where demand for personalized, high-quality itineraries is rising. However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data, failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor, a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over 500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10\% of the itineraries generated by the latest state-of-the-art LLMs achieve human-level performance. Moreover, we identify several critical challenges in travel planning, including the feasibility, rationality, and personalized customization of the proposed solutions. We hope that TripTailor will drive the development of travel planning agents capable of understanding and meeting user needs while generating practical itineraries. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/swxkfm/TripTailor

arXiv:2508.01451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning and Large language models (LLMs) for vulnerability detection has received significant attention in recent years. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art techniques show that LLMs are unsuccessful in even distinguishing the vulnerable function from its benign counterpart, due to three main problems: Vulnerability detection requires deep analysis, which LLMs often struggle with when making a one-shot prediction. Existing techniques typically perform function-level analysis, whereas effective vulnerability detection requires contextual information beyond the function scope. The focus on binary classification can result in identifying a vulnerability but associating it with the wrong security weaknesses (CWE), which may mislead developers. We propose a novel multi-agent LLM approach to address the challenges of identifying CWEs. This approach consists of three steps: (1) a team of LLM agents performs an exhaustive search for potential CWEs in the function under review, (2) another team of agents identifies relevant external context to support or refute each candidate CWE, and (3) a final agent makes informed acceptance or rejection decisions for each CWE based on the gathered context. A preliminary evaluation of our approach shows promising results. In the PrimeVul dataset, Step 1 correctly identifies the appropriate CWE in 40.9\% of the studied vulnerable functions. We further evaluated the full pipeline on ten synthetic programs and found that incorporating context information significantly reduced false positives from 6 to 9 CWEs to just 1 to 2, while still correctly identifying the true CWE in 9 out of 10 cases.

<title>Reconstructing Trust Embeddings from Siamese Trust Scores: A Direct-Sum Approach with Fixed-Point Semantics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inverse problem of reconstructing high-dimensional trust embeddings from the one-dimensional Siamese trust scores that many distributed-security frameworks expose. Starting from two independent agents that publish time-stamped similarity scores for the same set of devices, we formalise the estimation task, derive an explicit direct-sum estimator that concatenates paired score series with four moment features, and prove that the resulting reconstruction map admits a unique fixed point under a contraction argument rooted in Banach theory. A suite of synthetic benchmarks (20 devices x 10 time steps) confirms that, even in the presence of Gaussian noise, the recovered embeddings preserve inter-device geometry as measured by Euclidean and cosine metrics; we complement these experiments with non-asymptotic error bounds that link reconstruction accuracy to score-sequence length. Beyond methodology, the paper demonstrates a practical privacy risk: publishing granular trust scores can leak latent behavioural information about both devices and evaluation models. We therefore discuss counter-measures -- score quantisation, calibrated noise, obfuscated embedding spaces -- and situate them within wider debates on transparency versus confidentiality in networked AI systems. All datasets, reproduction scripts and extended proofs accompany the submission so that results can be verified without proprietary code.

Abstract: Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities for creating pedagogical agents that engage in meaningful dialogue to support student learning. However, the current use of LLM systems like ChatGPT in classrooms often lacks the solid theoretical foundation found in earlier intelligent tutoring systems. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework that combines Evidence-Centered Design with Social Cognitive Theory for adaptive scaffolding in LLM-based agents focused on STEM+C learning. We illustrate this framework with Inquizzitor, an LLM-based formative assessment agent that integrates human-AI hybrid intelligence and provides feedback grounded in cognitive science principles. Our findings show that Inquizzitor delivers high-quality assessment and interaction aligned with core learning theories, offering teachers effective guidance that students value. This research underscores the potential for theory-driven LLM integration in education, highlighting the ability of these systems to provide adaptive and principled instruction.

arXiv:2508.01522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states, inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition, we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller, enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete in-flight loss of one MAV.

<title>Revisiting Gossip Protocols: A Vision for Emergent Coordination in Agentic Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: As agentic platforms scale, agents are evolving beyond static roles and fixed toolchains, creating a growing need for flexible, decentralized coordination. Today's structured communication protocols (e.g., direct agent-to-agent messaging) excel at reliability and task delegation, but they fall short in enabling emergent, swarm-like intelligence, where distributed agents continuously learn, adapt, and communicate to form collective cognition. This paper revisits gossip protocols, long valued in distributed systems for their fault tolerance and decentralization, and argues that they offer a missing layer for context-rich, adaptive communication in agentic AI. Gossip enables scalable, low-overhead dissemination of shared knowledge, but also raises unresolved challenges around semantic filtering, staleness, trustworthiness, and consistency in high-stakes environments. Rather than proposing a new framework, this work charts a research agenda for integrating gossip as a complementary substrate alongside structured protocols. We identify critical gaps in current agent-to-agent architectures, highlight where gossip could reshape assumptions about coordination, and outline open questions around intent propagation, knowledge decay, and peer-to-peer trust. Gossip is not a silver bullet, but overlooking it risks missing a key path toward resilient, reflexive, and self-organizing multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment, where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor, multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500 trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment. However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3, N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates (46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions). These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.

Abstract: Training software engineering (SWE) LLMs is bottlenecked by expensive infrastructure, inefficient evaluation pipelines, scarce training data, and costly quality control. We present RepoForge, an autonomous, end-to-end pipeline that generates, evaluates, and trains SWE agents at scale. Our key contributions include: (1) RepoForge-8B-Agent, achieving 17.4\% on SWE-Bench-Verified~\citep{swebench_verified2024}, establishing new state-of-the-art for $\leq$8B non-thinking LLMs; (2) 7,304 executable environments auto-generated from real GitHub commits with zero manual intervention; (3) 14$\times$ storage reduction (1.4GB $\rightarrow$ 102MB per instance) via intelligent dependency management and image pruning; (4) $>$70\% faster evaluation using a Ray-powered~\citep{ray2018} distributed RepoForge harness; (5) 19,000$\times$ cheaper labeling through our automated SPICE~\citep{spice2024} difficulty assessment technique. By unifying storage-efficient sandboxing, Ray-powered evaluation harness, automated data generation, SPICE-based labeling, and bubble-free RL scaffold, we demonstrate that even $\leq$8B models can reach new state-of-the-art performance on demanding benchmarks like SWE-Bench-Verified. Our approach addresses critical bottlenecks in SWE agent training: high storage costs of container-based evaluation, inefficient sequential reward pipelines, limited availability of high-quality training data, expensive manual labeling, and multi-turn RL pipeline bottlenecks.

<title>Polymorphic Combinatorial Frameworks (PCF): Guiding the Design of Mathematically-Grounded, Adaptive AI Agents</title>

Abstract: The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments. Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches, Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over 1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.

<title>Augmented Reinforcement Learning Framework For Enhancing Decision-Making In Machine Learning Models Using External Agents</title>

Abstract: This work proposes a novel technique Augmented Reinforcement Learning framework for the improvement of decision-making capabilities of machine learning models. The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on model decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated scripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the priority of the "Garbage-In, Garbage-Out" problem that caused poor data inputs or incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates two external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality data at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time evaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model, identify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External Agent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and accuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training cycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world scenario, which is "Document Identification and Information Extraction". This problem originates mainly from banking systems, but can be extended anywhere. The method of classification and extraction of information has to be done correctly here. Experimental results show that including human feedback significantly enhances the ability of the model in order to increase robustness and accuracy in making decisions. The augmented approach, with a combination of machine efficiency and human insight, attains a higher learning standard-mainly in complex or ambiguous environments. The findings of this study show that human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning frameworks such as ARL can provide a scalable approach to improving model performance in data-driven applications.

Abstract: This research presents LLM Pokemon League, a competitive tournament system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent agents to simulate strategic decision-making in Pok\'emon battles. The platform is designed to analyze and compare the reasoning, adaptability, and tactical depth exhibited by different LLMs in a type-based, turn-based combat environment. By structuring the competition as a single-elimination tournament involving diverse AI trainers, the system captures detailed decision logs, including team-building rationale, action selection strategies, and switching decisions. The project enables rich exploration into comparative AI behavior, battle psychology, and meta-strategy development in constrained, rule-based game environments. Through this system, we investigate how modern LLMs understand, adapt, and optimize decisions under uncertainty, making Pok\'emon League a novel benchmark for AI research in strategic reasoning and competitive learning.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in knowledge-intensive tasks. Despite its advantages, current RAG methods often struggle to *fully exploit knowledge during generation*. In particular, the synergy between the model's internal parametric knowledge and external retrieved knowledge remains limited. Retrieved contents may sometimes mislead generation, while certain generated content can guide the model toward more accurate outputs. In this work, we propose Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a framework designed to enhance explicitly synergy over both parametric and retrieved knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent RAG framework that first performs conditional knowledge induction and then reasons answers. Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training strategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from CoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM. This strategy enhances the model's capability to explicitly integrate and jointly leverage parametric and retrieved knowledge. Experiments results show that CoCoA-zero and CoCoA achieve superior performance on open-domain and multi-hop QA tasks.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation, cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese. The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1, comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

Abstract: Grounding natural language instructions to visual observations is fundamental for embodied agents operating in open-world environments. Recent advances in visual-language mapping have enabled generalizable semantic representations by leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). However, these methods often fall short in aligning free-form language commands with specific scene instances, due to limitations in both instance-level semantic consistency and instruction interpretation. We present OpenMap, a zero-shot open-vocabulary visual-language map designed for accurate instruction grounding in navigation tasks. To address semantic inconsistencies across views, we introduce a Structural-Semantic Consensus constraint that jointly considers global geometric structure and vision-language similarity to guide robust 3D instance-level aggregation. To improve instruction interpretation, we propose an LLM-assisted Instruction-to-Instance Grounding module that enables fine-grained instance selection by incorporating spatial context and expressive target descriptions. We evaluate OpenMap on ScanNet200 and Matterport3D, covering both semantic mapping and instruction-to-target retrieval tasks. Experimental results show that OpenMap outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in bridging free-form language and 3D perception for embodied navigation.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes' theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12 optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases significantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic reasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation. The code is available at https://github.com/farlit/VPN.

<title>DiffSemanticFusion: Semantic Raster BEV Fusion for Autonomous Driving via Online HD Map Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition, extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance performance. All artifacts are available at https://github.com/SunZhigang7/DiffSemanticFusion.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and 527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model (Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic, tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable and reproducible research on agent capabilities. Our code and data will be publicly available at https://icip-cas.github.io/LiveMCPBench.

<title>AGENTICT$^2$S:Robust Text-to-SPARQL via Agentic Collaborative Reasoning over Heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs for the Circular Economy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Question answering over heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGQA) involves reasoning across diverse schemas, incomplete alignments, and distributed data sources. Existing text-to-SPARQL approaches rely on large-scale domain-specific fine-tuning or operate within single-graph settings, limiting their generalizability in low-resource domains and their ability to handle queries spanning multiple graphs. These challenges are particularly relevant in domains such as the circular economy, where information about classifications, processes, and emissions is distributed across independently curated knowledge graphs (KGs). We present AgenticT$^2$S, a modular framework that decomposes KGQA into subtasks managed by specialized agents responsible for retrieval, query generation, and verification. A scheduler assigns subgoals to different graphs using weak-to-strong alignment strategies. A two-stage verifier detects structurally invalid and semantically underspecified queries through symbolic validation and counterfactual consistency checks. Experiments on real-world circular economy KGs demonstrate that AgenticT$^2$S improves execution accuracy by 17.3% and triple level F$_1$ by 25.4% over the best baseline, while reducing the average prompt length by 46.4%. These results demonstrate the benefits of agent-based schema-aware reasoning for scalable KGQA and support decision-making in sustainability domains through robust cross-graph reasoning.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task. Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting. These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.

Abstract: Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore, we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two knowledge types, representing the "what" of learning. Conversely, cognitive processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining the "how" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the "nouns" upon which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities.

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in day-ahead energy markets introduces challenges in balancing supply and demand, ensuring grid resilience, and maintaining trust in decentralized trading systems. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method, with blockchain technology to optimize automated trading strategies for prosumers in day-ahead energy markets. We introduce a comprehensive framework that employs RL agent for multi-objective energy optimization and blockchain for tamper-proof data and transaction management. Simulations using real-world data from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The RL agent achieves demand-supply balancing within 2\% and maintains near-optimal supply costs for the majority of the operating hours. Moreover, it generates robust battery storage policies capable of handling variability in solar and wind generation. All decisions are recorded on an Algorand-based blockchain, ensuring transparency, auditability, and security - key enablers for trustworthy multi-agent energy trading. Our contributions include a novel system architecture, curriculum learning for robust agent development, and actionable policy insights for practical deployment.

<title>EgoTrigger: Toward Audio-Driven Image Capture for Human Memory Enhancement in All-Day Energy-Efficient Smart Glasses</title>

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach, EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components (e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use -- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

<title>L3M+P: Lifelong Planning with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: By combining classical planning methods with large language models (LLMs), recent research such as LLM+P has enabled agents to plan for general tasks given in natural language. However, scaling these methods to general-purpose service robots remains challenging: (1) classical planning algorithms generally require a detailed and consistent specification of the environment, which is not always readily available; and (2) existing frameworks mainly focus on isolated planning tasks, whereas robots are often meant to serve in long-term continuous deployments, and therefore must maintain a dynamic memory of the environment which can be updated with multi-modal inputs and extracted as planning knowledge for future tasks. To address these two issues, this paper introduces L3M+P (Lifelong LLM+P), a framework that uses an external knowledge graph as a representation of the world state. The graph can be updated from multiple sources of information, including sensory input and natural language interactions with humans. L3M+P enforces rules for the expected format of the absolute world state graph to maintain consistency between graph updates. At planning time, given a natural language description of a task, L3M+P retrieves context from the knowledge graph and generates a problem definition for classical planners. Evaluated on household robot simulators and on a real-world service robot, L3M+P achieves significant improvement over baseline methods both on accurately registering natural language state changes and on correctly generating plans, thanks to the knowledge graph retrieval and verification.

Abstract: World models have become increasingly popular in acting as learned traffic simulators. Recent work has explored replacing traditional traffic simulators with world models for policy training. In this work, we explore the robustness of existing metrics to evaluate world models as traffic simulators to see if the same metrics are suitable for evaluating a world model as a pseudo-environment for policy training. Specifically, we analyze the metametric employed by the Waymo Open Sim-Agents Challenge (WOSAC) and compare world model predictions on standard scenarios where the agents are fully or partially controlled by the world model (partial replay). Furthermore, since we are interested in evaluating the ego action-conditioned world model, we extend the standard WOSAC evaluation domain to include agents that are causal to the ego vehicle. Our evaluations reveal a significant number of scenarios where top-ranking models perform well under no perturbation but fail when the ego agent is forced to replay the original trajectory. To address these cases, we propose new metrics to highlight the sensitivity of world models to uncontrollable objects and evaluate the performance of world models as pseudo-environments for policy training and analyze some state-of-the-art world models under these new metrics.

<title>Agent-Based Feature Generation from Clinical Notes for Outcome Prediction</title>

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance. Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in 147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for clinical deployment.

<title>SpeechRole: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Evaluating Speech Role-Playing Agents</title>

Abstract: Recently, role-playing agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving personalized interaction and emotional resonance. Existing research primarily focuses on the textual modality, neglecting the critical dimension of speech in realistic interactive scenarios. In particular, there is a lack of systematic evaluation for Speech Role-Playing Agents (SRPAs). To address this gap, we construct SpeechRole-Data, a large-scale, high-quality dataset that comprises 98 diverse roles and 112k speech-based single-turn and multi-turn conversations. Each role demonstrates distinct vocal characteristics, including timbre and prosody, thereby enabling more sophisticated speech role-playing. Furthermore, we propose SpeechRole-Eval, a multidimensional evaluation benchmark that systematically assesses SRPAs performance in key aspects such as fundamental interaction ability, speech expressiveness, and role-playing fidelity. Experimental results reveal the advantages and challenges of both cascaded and end-to-end speech role-playing agents in maintaining vocal style consistency and role coherence. We release all data, code, and baseline models to provide a solid foundation for speech-driven multimodal role-playing research and to foster further developments in this field.

<title>A Group Consensus-Driven Auction Algorithm for Cooperative Task Allocation Among Heterogeneous Multi-Agents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scenarios like automated warehouses, assigning tasks to robots presents a heterogeneous multi-task and multi-agent task allocation problem. However, existing task allocation study ignores the integration of multi-task and multi-attribute agent task allocation with heterogeneous task allocation. In addition, current algorithms are limited by scenario constraints and can incur significant errors in specific contexts. Therefore, this study proposes a distributed heterogeneous multi-task and multi-agent task allocation algorithm with a time window, called group consensus-based heterogeneous auction (GCBHA). Firstly, this method decomposes tasks that exceed the capability of a single Agent into subtasks that can be completed by multiple independent agents. And then groups similar or adjacent tasks through a heuristic clustering method to reduce the time required to reach a consensus. Subsequently, the task groups are allocated to agents that meet the conditions through an auction process. Furthermore, the method evaluates the task path cost distance based on the scenario, which can calculate the task cost more accurately. The experimental results demonstrate that GCBHA performs well in terms of task allocation time and solution quality, with a significant reduction in the error rate between predicted task costs and actual costs.

<title>An Evolving Scenario Generation Method based on Dual-modal Driver Model Trained by Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: In the autonomous driving testing methods based on evolving scenarios, the construction method of the driver model, which determines the driving maneuvers of background vehicles (BVs) in the scenario, plays a critical role in generating safety-critical scenarios. In particular, the cooperative adversarial driving characteristics between BVs can contribute to the efficient generation of safety-critical scenarios with high testing value. In this paper, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is used to train and generate a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) with non-adversarial and adversarial driving modalities. The model is then connected to a continuous simulated traffic environment to generate complex, diverse and strong interactive safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation method. After that, the generated evolving scenarios are evaluated in terms of fidelity, test efficiency, complexity and diversity. Results show that without performance degradation in scenario fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world scenarios) and complexity (complexity metric: 0.45, +32.35% and +12.5% over two baselines), Dual-DM achieves a substantial enhancement in the efficiency of generating safety-critical scenarios (efficiency metric: 0.86, +195% over two baselines). Furthermore, statistical analysis and case studies demonstrate the diversity of safety-critical evolving scenarios generated by Dual-DM in terms of the adversarial interaction patterns. Therefore, Dual-DM can greatly improve the performance of the generation of safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation method.

Abstract: Recent advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) and embodied navigation have driven significant progress, yet these domains have largely evolved in isolation, with disparate datasets and training paradigms. In this paper, we observe that both tasks can be formulated as Markov Decision Processes (MDP), suggesting a foundational principle for their unification. Hence, we present NaviMaster, the first unified agent capable of seamlessly integrating GUI navigation and embodied navigation within a single framework. Specifically, NaviMaster (i) proposes a visual-target trajectory collection pipeline that generates trajectories for both GUI and embodied tasks in one formulation. (ii) employs a unified reinforcement learning framework on the mix data for better generalization. (iii) designs a novel distance-aware reward to ensure efficient learning from the trajectories. Through extensive experiments on out-of-domain benchmarks, NaviMaster is shown to outperform state-of-the-art agents in GUI navigation, spatial affordance prediction, and embodied navigation. Ablation studies further confirm the efficacy of our unified training strategy, data mixing strategy, and reward design.

<title>Everyone Contributes! Incentivizing Strategic Cooperation in Multi-LLM Systems via Sequential Public Goods Games</title>

arXiv:2508.02076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks collaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and collective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel, game-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the Multi-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to systematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward, effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results highlight the power of structured, incentive-aligned MAC-SPGG cooperation for scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

<title>SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/wanghuacan/SE-Agent.

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual refinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN

<title>Attractive Metadata Attack: Inducing LLM Agents to Invoke Malicious Tools</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However, this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names, descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic, simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface, highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond prompt-level defenses.

Abstract: As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention. However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity, hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed. Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse. To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and resolution.

Abstract: Partial observability presents a significant challenge for safe reinforcement learning, as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards. Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes. In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of incorporating privileged information. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the Privileged Information Guided Dreamer, a model-based safe reinforcement learning approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of safety and task-centric performance. Meanwhile, compared to alternative privileged model-based reinforcement learning methods, our approach exhibits superior performance and ease of training.

Abstract: The emergence of the Internet of Agents (IoA) introduces critical challenges for communication privacy in sensitive, high-stakes domains. While standard Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols secure message content, they are not designed to protect the act of communication itself, leaving agents vulnerable to surveillance and traffic analysis. We find that the rich, event-driven nature of agent dialogues provides a powerful, yet untapped, medium for covert communication. To harness this potential, we introduce and formalize the Covert Event Channel, the first unified model for agent covert communication driven by three interconnected dimensions, which consist of the Storage, Timing,and Behavioral channels. Based on this model, we design and engineer {\Pi}CCAP, a novel protocol that operationalizes this event-driven paradigm. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that {\Pi}CCAP achieves high capacity and robustness while remaining imperceptible to powerful LLM-based wardens, establishing its practical viability. By systematically engineering this channel, our work provides the foundational understanding essential for developing the next generation of monitoring systems and defensive protocols for a secure and trustworthy IoA.

Abstract: We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking. This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations, providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in artificial agents.

<title>Multi-Policy Pareto Front Tracking Based Online and Offline Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2508.02217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) plays a pivotal role in addressing multi-criteria decision-making problems in the real world. The multi-policy (MP) based methods are widely used to obtain high-quality Pareto front approximation for the MORL problems. However, traditional MP methods only rely on the online reinforcement learning (RL) and adopt the evolutionary framework with a large policy population. This may lead to sample inefficiency and/or overwhelmed agent-environment interactions in practice. By forsaking the evolutionary framework, we propose the novel Multi-policy Pareto Front Tracking (MPFT) framework without maintaining any policy population, where both online and offline MORL algorithms can be applied. The proposed MPFT framework includes four stages: Stage 1 approximates all the Pareto-vertex policies, whose mapping to the objective space fall on the vertices of the Pareto front. Stage 2 designs the new Pareto tracking mechanism to track the Pareto front, starting from each of the Pareto-vertex policies. Stage 3 identifies the sparse regions in the tracked Pareto front, and introduces a new objective weight adjustment method to fill the sparse regions. Finally, by combining all the policies tracked in Stages 2 and 3, Stage 4 approximates the Pareto front. Experiments are conducted on seven different continuous-action robotic control tasks with both online and offline MORL algorithms, and demonstrate the superior hypervolume performance of our proposed MPFT approach over the state-of-the-art benchmarks, with significantly reduced agent-environment interactions and hardware requirements.

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules: Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus. We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction, using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling challenge. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/CellForge.

<title>Distributed Non-Uniform Scaling Control of Multi-Agent Formation via Matrix-Valued Constraints</title>

Abstract: Distributed formation maneuver control refers to the problem of maneuvering a group of agents to change their formation shape by adjusting the motions of partial agents, where the controller of each agent only requires local information measured from its neighbors. Although this problem has been extensively investigated, existing approaches are mostly limited to uniform scaling transformations. This article proposes a new type of local matrix-valued constraints, via which non-uniform scaling control of position formation can be achieved by tuning the positions of only two agents (i.e., leaders). Here, the non-uniform scaling transformation refers to scaling the position formation with different ratios along different orthogonal coordinate directions. Moreover, by defining scaling and translation of attitude formation, we propose a distributed control scheme for scaling and translation maneuver control of joint position-attitude formations. It is proven that the proposed controller achieves global convergence, provided that the sensing graph among agents is a 2-rooted bidirectional graph. Compared with the affine formation maneuver control approach, the proposed approach leverages a sparser sensing graph, requires fewer leaders, and additionally enables scaling transformations of the attitude formation. A simulation example is proposed to demonstrate our theoretical results.

Abstract: Financial AI holds great promise for transforming modern finance, with the potential to support a wide range of tasks such as market forecasting, portfolio management, quantitative trading, and automated analysis. However, existing platforms remain limited in task coverage, lack robust multimodal data integration, and offer insufficient support for the training and deployment of large language models (LLMs). In response to these limitations, we present FinWorld, an all-in-one open-source platform that provides end-to-end support for the entire financial AI workflow, from data acquisition to experimentation and deployment. FinWorld distinguishes itself through native integration of heterogeneous financial data, unified support for diverse AI paradigms, and advanced agent automation, enabling seamless development and deployment. Leveraging data from 2 representative markets, 4 stock pools, and over 800 million financial data points, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 4 key financial AI tasks. These experiments systematically evaluate deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms, with particular emphasis on RL-based finetuning for LLMs and LLM Agents. The empirical results demonstrate that FinWorld significantly enhances reproducibility, supports transparent benchmarking, and streamlines deployment, thereby providing a strong foundation for future research and real-world applications. Code is available at Github~\footnote{https://github.com/DVampire/FinWorld}.

<title>Agentic Personalized Fashion Recommendation in the Age of Generative AI: Challenges, Opportunities, and Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Fashion recommender systems (FaRS) face distinct challenges due to rapid trend shifts, nuanced user preferences, intricate item-item compatibility, and the complex interplay among consumers, brands, and influencers. Traditional recommendation approaches, largely static and retrieval-focused, struggle to effectively capture these dynamic elements, leading to decreased user satisfaction and elevated return rates. This paper synthesizes both academic and industrial viewpoints to map the distinctive output space and stakeholder ecosystem of modern FaRS, identifying the complex interplay among users, brands, platforms, and influencers, and highlighting the unique data and modeling challenges that arise.
  We outline a research agenda for industrial FaRS, centered on five representative scenarios spanning static queries, outfit composition, and multi-turn dialogue, and argue that mixed-modality refinement-the ability to combine image-based references (anchors) with nuanced textual constraints-is a particularly critical task for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose an Agentic Mixed-Modality Refinement (AMMR) pipeline, which fuses multimodal encoders with agentic LLM planners and dynamic retrieval, bridging the gap between expressive user intent and fast-changing fashion inventories. Our work shows that moving beyond static retrieval toward adaptive, generative, and stakeholder-aware systems is essential to satisfy the evolving expectations of fashion consumers and brands.

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term decisions aligned with long-term financial goals. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for such tactical decisions, its adoption remains limited by myopic behavior and opaque policy rationale. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strategic reasoning and multi-modal financial signal interpretation when guided by well-designed prompts.
  We propose a hybrid system where LLMs generate high-level trading strategies to guide RL agents in their actions. We evaluate (i) the rationale of LLM-generated strategies via expert review, and (ii) the Sharpe Ratio (SR) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of LLM-guided agents versus unguided baselines. Results show improved return and risk metrics over standard RL.

<title>Talking Surveys: How Photorealistic Embodied Conversational Agents Shape Response Quality, Engagement, and Satisfaction</title>

Abstract: Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are increasingly more realistic and capable of dynamic conversations. In online surveys, anthropomorphic agents could help address issues like careless responding and satisficing, which originate from the lack of personal engagement and perceived accountability. However, there is a lack of understanding of how ECAs in user experience research may affect participant engagement, satisfaction, and the quality of responses. As a proof of concept, we propose an instrument that enables the incorporation of conversations with a virtual avatar into surveys, using on AI-driven video generation, speech recognition, and Large Language Models. In our between-subjects study, 80 participants (UK, stratified random sample of general population) either talked to a voice-based agent with an animated video avatar, or interacted with a chatbot. Across surveys based on two self-reported psychometric tests, 2,265 conversation responses were obtained. Statistical comparison of results indicates that embodied agents can contribute significantly to more informative, detailed responses, as well as higher yet more time-efficient engagement. Furthermore, qualitative analysis provides valuable insights for causes of no significant change to satisfaction, linked to personal preferences, turn-taking delays and Uncanny Valley reactions. These findings support the pursuit and development of new methods toward human-like agents for the transformation of online surveys into more natural interactions resembling in-person interviews.

<title>Beyond Manually Designed Pruning Policies with Second-Level Performance Prediction: A Pruning Framework for LLMs</title>

Abstract: Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g., layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to 33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods, outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction error < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1 minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52 second), achieving over 64 times speedup. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Ma-zx/PPF .

Abstract: Stackelberg games and their resulting equilibria have received increasing attention in the multi-agent reinforcement learning literature. Each stage of a traditional Stackelberg game involves a leader(s) acting first, followed by the followers. In situations where the roles of leader(s) and followers can be interchanged, the designated role can have considerable advantages, for example, in first-mover advantage settings. Then the question arises: Who should be the leader and when? A bias in the leader selection process can lead to unfair outcomes. This problem is aggravated if the agents are self-interested and care only about their goals and rewards. We formally define this leader selection problem and show its relation to fairness in agents' returns. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that maximizes fairness by integrating mediators. Mediators have previously been used in the simultaneous action setting with varying levels of control, such as directly performing agents' actions or just recommending them. Our framework integrates mediators in the Stackelberg setting with minimal control (leader selection). We show that the presence of mediators leads to self-interested agents taking fair actions, resulting in higher overall fairness in agents' returns.

Abstract: While many tools are available for designing AI, non-experts still face challenges in clearly expressing their intent and managing system complexity. We introduce AIAP, a no-code platform that integrates natural language input with visual workflows. AIAP leverages a coordinated multi-agent system to decompose ambiguous user instructions into modular, actionable steps, hidden from users behind a unified interface. A user study involving 32 participants showed that AIAP's AI-generated suggestions, modular workflows, and automatic identification of data, actions, and context significantly improved participants' ability to develop services intuitively. These findings highlight that natural language-based visual programming significantly reduces barriers and enhances user experience in AI service design.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g., global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent, enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been at the forefront of applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in a multitude of domains. One such domain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of a number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex ecosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the realm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to localize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and LLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an average of 79.8\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation. We then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical for bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of Meta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores 84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization rates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation: agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled richer perceptual grounding for code policy generation in embodied agents. However, most existing systems lack effective mechanisms to adaptively monitor policy execution and repair codes during task completion. In this work, we introduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that systematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual monitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for embodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system first decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program grounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed in simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected checkpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure reasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events with VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and repairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting program synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that HyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of robot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating multimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines.

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking, vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why? We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products, raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy, platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.

Abstract: Multi-agent shepherding represents a challenging distributed control problem where herder agents must coordinate to guide independently moving targets to desired spatial configurations. Most existing control strategies assume cohesive target behavior, which frequently fails in practical applications where targets exhibit stochastic autonomous behavior. This paper presents a hierarchical learning-based control architecture that decomposes the shepherding problem into a high-level decision-making module and a low-level motion control component. The proposed distributed control system synthesizes effective control policies directly from closed-loop experience without requiring explicit inter-agent communication or prior knowledge of target dynamics. The decentralized architecture achieves cooperative control behavior through emergent coordination without centralized supervision. Experimental validation demonstrates superior closed-loop performance compared to state-of-the-art heuristic control methods, achieving 100\% success rates with improved settling times and control efficiency. The control architecture scales beyond its design conditions, adapts to time-varying goal regions, and demonstrates practical implementation feasibility through real-time experiments on the Robotarium platform.

<title>Towards Actionable Pedagogical Feedback: A Multi-Perspective Analysis of Mathematics Teaching and Tutoring Dialogue</title>

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for refining instructional practices in mathematics education, and researchers often turn to advanced natural language processing (NLP) models to analyze classroom dialogues from multiple perspectives. However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two primary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve multiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of many utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to their omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a multi-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves with dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with 43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation Theory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a comprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as utterances that do not contain talk moves. This is applied to two mathematics education datasets: TalkMoves (teaching) and SAGA22 (tutoring). Through distributional unigram analysis, sequential talk move analysis, and multi-view deep dive, we discovered meaningful discourse patterns, and revealed the vital role of utterances without talk moves, demonstrating that these utterances, far from being mere fillers, serve crucial functions in guiding, acknowledging, and structuring classroom discourse. These insights underscore the importance of incorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts into AI-assisted education systems to enhance feedback and create more responsive learning environments. Our framework may prove helpful for providing human educator feedback, but also aiding in the development of AI agents that can effectively emulate the roles of both educators and students.

<title>RL-U$^2$Net: A Dual-Branch UNet with Reinforcement Learning-Assisted Multimodal Feature Fusion for Accurate 3D Whole-Heart Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Accurate whole-heart segmentation is a critical component in the precise diagnosis and interventional planning of cardiovascular diseases. Integrating complementary information from modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly enhance segmentation accuracy and robustness. However, existing multi-modal segmentation methods face several limitations: severe spatial inconsistency between modalities hinders effective feature fusion; fusion strategies are often static and lack adaptability; and the processes of feature alignment and segmentation are decoupled and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-branch U-Net architecture enhanced by reinforcement learning for feature alignment, termed RL-U$^2$Net, designed for precise and efficient multi-modal 3D whole-heart segmentation. The model employs a dual-branch U-shaped network to process CT and MRI patches in parallel, and introduces a novel RL-XAlign module between the encoders. The module employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture semantic correspondences between modalities and a reinforcement-learning agent learns an optimal rotation strategy that consistently aligns anatomical pose and texture features. The aligned features are then reconstructed through their respective decoders. Finally, an ensemble-learning-based decision module integrates the predictions from individual patches to produce the final segmentation result. Experimental results on the publicly available MM-WHS 2017 dataset demonstrate that the proposed RL-U$^2$Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving Dice coefficients of 93.1% on CT and 87.0% on MRI, thereby validating the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.

Abstract: AlphaZero-style reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have achieved superhuman performance in many complex board games such as Chess, Shogi, and Go. However, we showcase that these algorithms encounter significant and fundamental challenges when applied to impartial games, a class where players share game pieces and optimal strategy often relies on abstract mathematical principles. Specifically, we utilize the game of Nim as a concrete and illustrative case study to reveal critical limitations of AlphaZero-style and similar self-play RL algorithms. We introduce a novel conceptual framework distinguishing between champion and expert mastery to evaluate RL agent performance. Our findings reveal that while AlphaZero-style agents can achieve champion-level play on very small Nim boards, their learning progression severely degrades as the board size increases. This difficulty stems not merely from complex data distributions or noisy labels, but from a deeper representational bottleneck: the inherent struggle of generic neural networks to implicitly learn abstract, non-associative functions like parity, which are crucial for optimal play in impartial games. This limitation causes a critical breakdown in the positive feedback loop essential for self-play RL, preventing effective learning beyond rote memorization of frequently observed states. These results align with broader concerns regarding AlphaZero-style algorithms' vulnerability to adversarial attacks, highlighting their inability to truly master all legal game states. Our work underscores that simple hyperparameter adjustments are insufficient to overcome these challenges, establishing a crucial foundation for the development of fundamentally novel algorithmic approaches, potentially involving neuro-symbolic or meta-learning paradigms, to bridge the gap towards true expert-level AI in combinatorial games.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, deep learning enabled motion prediction is a popular topic. A critical gap in traditional motion prediction methodologies lies in ensuring equivariance under Euclidean geometric transformations and maintaining invariant interaction relationships. This research introduces a groundbreaking solution by employing EqMotion, a theoretically geometric equivariant and interaction invariant motion prediction model for particles and humans, plus integrating agent-equivariant high-definition (HD) map features for context aware motion prediction in autonomous driving. The use of EqMotion as backbone marks a significant departure from existing methods by rigorously ensuring motion equivariance and interaction invariance. Equivariance here implies that an output motion must be equally transformed under the same Euclidean transformation as an input motion, while interaction invariance preserves the manner in which agents interact despite transformations. These properties make the network robust to arbitrary Euclidean transformations and contribute to more accurate prediction. In addition, we introduce an equivariant method to process the HD map to enrich the spatial understanding of the network while preserving the overall network equivariance property. By applying these technologies, our model is able to achieve high prediction accuracy while maintain a lightweight design and efficient data utilization.

Abstract: Forecasting vehicular motions in autonomous driving requires a deep understanding of agent interactions and the preservation of motion equivariance under Euclidean geometric transformations. Traditional models often lack the sophistication needed to handle the intricate dynamics inherent to autonomous vehicles and the interaction relationships among agents in the scene. As a result, these models have a lower model capacity, which then leads to higher prediction errors and lower training efficiency. In our research, we employ EqMotion, a leading equivariant particle, and human prediction model that also accounts for invariant agent interactions, for the task of multi-agent vehicle motion forecasting. In addition, we use a multi-modal prediction mechanism to account for multiple possible future paths in a probabilistic manner. By leveraging EqMotion, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with fewer parameters (1.2 million) and a significantly reduced training time (less than 2 hours).

Abstract: Swarm behaviour engineering is an area of research that seeks to investigate methods and techniques for coordinating computation and action within groups of simple agents to achieve complex global goals like pattern formation, collective movement, clustering, and distributed sensing. Despite recent progress in the analysis and engineering of swarms (of drones, robots, vehicles), there is still a need for general design and implementation methods and tools that can be used to define complex swarm behaviour in a principled way. To contribute to this quest, this article proposes a new field-based coordination approach, called MacroSwarm, to design and program swarm behaviour in terms of reusable and fully composable functional blocks embedding collective computation and coordination. Based on the macroprogramming paradigm of aggregate computing, MacroSwarm builds on the idea of expressing each swarm behaviour block as a pure function, mapping sensing fields into actuation goal fields, e.g., including movement vectors. In order to demonstrate the expressiveness, compositionality, and practicality of MacroSwarm as a framework for swarm programming, we perform a variety of simulations covering common patterns of flocking, pattern formation, and collective decision-making. The implications of the inherent self-stabilisation properties of field-based computations in MacroSwarm are discussed, which formally guarantee some resilience properties and guided the design of the library.

Abstract: We study the problem of fairly allocating $m$ indivisible goods to $n$ agents, where agents may have different preferences over the goods. In the traditional setting, agents' valuations are provided as inputs to the algorithm. In this paper, we adopt the query model, which has been widely considered for other similar problems (such as matching [Nis21], graph isomorphism [OS18], and equilibrium in game [Bab16]), and apply it to the fair division problem. In particular, we consider a new \emph{comparison-based query model}, where the algorithm presents two bundles of goods to an agent and the agent responds by telling the algorithm which bundle she prefers. We investigate the query complexity for computing allocations with several fairness notions, including \emph{proportionality up to one good} (PROP1), \emph{envy-freeness up to one good} (EF1), and \emph{maximin share} (MMS). Our main result is an algorithm that computes an allocation that satisfies both PROP1 and $\frac12$-MMS within $O(\log m)$ queries with a constant number of $n$ agents. For identical and additive valuation, we present an algorithm for computing an EF1 allocation within $O(\log m)$ queries with a constant number of $n$ agents. To complement the positive results, we show that the lower bound of the query complexity for any of the three fairness notions is $\Omega(\log m)$ even with two agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across diverse settings, but still struggle as the length and complexity of the context increases. To address this challenge, we propose Thinking Recursively and Dynamically (ThReaD). THREAD frames model generation as a thread of execution that, based on the context, can run to completion or dynamically spawn new threads. By spawning, threads can offload work (e.g., thinking, retrieving information) to child threads, which only return tokens needed for the parent thread to do its work. In effect, this enables the model to adapt, as needed, the amount of intermediate work used to produce tokens. We apply THREAD in the settings of LLM task solving and question answering, where the dynamic threading allows the model to recursively decompose the given task or question into progressively simpler sub-problems that can be solved by separate child threads. We test THREAD, implemented using a few-shot learning approach, on diverse benchmarks for agent tasks and data-grounded question answering. THREAD achieves state-of-the-art performance with GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 on these benchmarks, including ALFWorld, TextCraft, and WebShop, along with two new benchmarks, DataCommons QA and MIMIC-III ICU QA. In addition, THREAD outperforms existing frameworks by 10% to 50% absolute points with smaller models, including Llama-3-8b and CodeLlama-7b.

Abstract: Multi-agent credit assignment is a fundamental challenge for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where a team of agents learn from shared reward signals. The Individual-Global-Max (IGM) condition is a widely used principle for multi-agent credit assignment, requiring that the joint action determined by individual Q-functions maximizes the global Q-value. Meanwhile, the principle of maximum entropy has been leveraged to enhance exploration in MARL. However, we identify a critical limitation in existing maximum entropy MARL methods: a misalignment arises between local policies and the joint policy that maximizes the global Q-value, leading to violations of the IGM condition. To address this misalignment, we propose an order-preserving transformation. Building on it, we introduce ME-IGM, a novel maximum entropy MARL algorithm compatible with any credit assignment mechanism that satisfies the IGM condition while enjoying the benefits of maximum entropy exploration. We empirically evaluate two variants of ME-IGM: ME-QMIX and ME-QPLEX, in non-monotonic matrix games, and demonstrate their state-of-the-art performance across 17 scenarios in SMAC-v2 and Overcooked.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) aims to develop agents capable of navigating in realistic environments. While recent cross-modal training approaches have significantly improved navigation performance in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, aerial navigation over real-world cities remains underexplored primarily due to limited datasets and the difficulty of integrating visual and geographic information. To fill this gap, we introduce CityNav, the first large-scale real-world dataset for aerial VLN. Our dataset consists of 32,637 human demonstration trajectories, each paired with a natural language description, covering 4.65 km$^2$ across two real cities: Cambridge and Birmingham. In contrast to existing datasets composed of synthetic scenes such as AerialVLN, our dataset presents a unique challenge because agents must interpret spatial relationships between real-world landmarks and the navigation destination, making CityNav an essential benchmark for advancing aerial VLN. Furthermore, as an initial step toward addressing this challenge, we provide a methodology of creating geographic semantic maps that can be used as an auxiliary modality input during navigation. In our experiments, we compare performance of three representative aerial VLN agents (Seq2seq, CMA and AerialVLN models) and demonstrate that the semantic map representation significantly improves their navigation performance.

Abstract: We present three game-playing agents incorporating Vision Transformers (ViT) into the AlphaZero framework: AlphaViT, AlphaViD (AlphaViT with a transformer decoder), and AlphaVDA (AlphaViD with learnable action embeddings). These agents can play multiple board games of varying sizes using a single neural network with shared weights, thus overcoming AlphaZero's limitation of fixed board sizes. AlphaViT employs only a transformer encoder, whereas AlphaViD and AlphaVDA incorporate both a transformer encoder and a decoder. In AlphaViD, the decoder processes outputs from the encoder, whereas AlphaVDA uses learnable embeddings as the decoder inputs. The additional decoder in AlphaViD and AlphaVDA provides flexibility to adapt to various action spaces and board sizes. Experimental results show that the proposed agents, trained on either individual games or on multiple games simultaneously, consistently outperform traditional algorithms, such as Minimax and Monte Carlo Tree Search. They approach the performance of AlphaZero despite relying on a single deep neural network (DNN) with shared weights. In particular, AlphaViT performs strongly across all evaluated games. Furthermore, fine-tuning the DNN with weights pre-trained on small board games accelerates convergence and improves performance, particularly in Gomoku. Interestingly, simultaneous training on multiple games yields performance comparable to, or even surpassing, that of single-game training. These results indicate the potential of transformer-based architectures for developing more flexible and robust game-playing AI agents that excel in multiple games and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable traffic scenes from natural language can greatly enhance the development and evaluation of autonomous driving systems. However, this task poses unique challenges: (1) grounding free-form text into spatially valid and semantically coherent layouts, (2) composing scenarios without predefined locations, and (3) planning multi-agent behaviors and selecting roads that respect agents' configurations. To address these, we propose a modular framework, TTSG, comprising prompt analysis, road retrieval, agent planning, and a novel plan-aware road ranking algorithm to solve these challenges. While large language models (LLMs) are used as general planners, our design integrates them into a tightly controlled pipeline that enforces structure, feasibility, and scene diversity. Notably, our ranking strategy ensures consistency between agent actions and road geometry, enabling scene generation without predefined routes or spawn points. The framework supports both routine and safety-critical scenarios, as well as multi-stage event composition. Experiments on SafeBench demonstrate that our method achieves the lowest average collision rate (3.5\%) across three critical scenarios. Moreover, driving captioning models trained on our generated scenes improve action reasoning by over 30 CIDEr points. These results underscore our proposed framework for flexible, interpretable, and safety-oriented simulation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel zone-based flocking control approach suitable for dynamic multi-agent systems (MAS). Inspired by Reynolds behavioral rules for $boids$, flocking behavioral rules with the zones of repulsion, conflict, attraction, and surveillance are introduced. For each agent, using only bearing and distance measurements, behavioral contribution vectors quantify the local separation, local and global flock velocity alignment, local cohesion, obstacle avoidance and boundary conditions, and strategic separation for avoiding alien agents. The control strategy uses the local perception-based behavioral contribution vectors to guide each agent's motion. Additionally, the control strategy incorporates a directionally aware obstacle avoidance mechanism that prioritizes obstacles in the agent's forward path. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the model in creating flexible, adaptable, and scalable flocking behavior. Asymptotic stability and convergence to a stable flocking configuration for any initial conditions provided the interaction graph is a spanning tree are demonstrated. The flocking model's reliance on locally sensed bearing and distance measurements ensures scalability and robustness, particularly in scenarios where communication is unreliable or resource-intensive. This makes it well-suited for real-world applications demanding seamless operation in highly dynamic and distributed environments.

Abstract: Curriculum learning has been a quiet, yet crucial component of many high-profile successes of reinforcement learning. Despite this, it is still a niche topic that is not directly supported by any of the major reinforcement learning libraries. These methods can improve the capabilities and generalization of RL agents, but often require complex changes to training code. We introduce Syllabus, a portable curriculum learning library, as a solution to this problem. Syllabus provides a universal API for curriculum learning, modular implementations of popular automatic curriculum learning methods, and infrastructure that allows them to be easily integrated with asynchronous training code in nearly any RL library. Syllabus provides a minimal API for core curriculum learning components, making it easier to design new algorithms and adapt existing ones to new environments. We demonstrate this by evaluating the algorithms in Syllabus on several new environments, each using agents written in a different RL library. We present the first examples of automatic curriculum learning in NetHack and Neural MMO, two of the most challenging RL benchmarks, and find evidence that existing methods do not directly transfer to complex new environments. Syllabus can be found at https://github.com/RyanNavillus/Syllabus.

Abstract: Solving complex reasoning tasks is a key real-world application of agents. Thanks to the pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) on code data, recent approaches like CodeAct successfully use code as LLM agents' action, achieving good results. However, CodeAct greedily generates the next action's code block by relying on fragmented thoughts, resulting in inconsistency and instability. Moreover, CodeAct lacks action-related ground-truth (GT), making its supervision signals and termination conditions questionable in multi-turn interactions. To address these issues, we first introduce a simple yet effective end-to-end code generation paradigm, CodeProgram, which leverages code's systematic logic to align with global reasoning and enable cohesive problem-solving. Then, we propose Tree-of-Code (ToC), which self-grows CodeProgram nodes based on the executable nature of the code and enables self-supervision in a GT-free scenario. Experimental results on two datasets using ten popular zero-shot LLMs show ToC remarkably boosts accuracy by nearly 20% over CodeAct with less than 1/4 turns. Several LLMs even perform better on one-turn CodeProgram than on multi-turn CodeAct. To further investigate the trade-off between efficacy and efficiency, we test different ToC tree sizes and exploration mechanisms. We also highlight the potential of ToC's end-to-end data generation for supervised and reinforced fine-tuning.

Abstract: We study the distributed consensus of state vectors in a discrete-time multi-agent network with matrix edge weights using stochastic matrix convergence theory. We present a distributed asynchronous time update model wherein one randomly selected agent updates its state vector at a time by interacting with its neighbors. We prove that all agents converge to same state vector almost surely when every edge weight matrix is positive definite. We study vector consensus in cooperative-competitive networks with edge weights being either positive or negative definite matrices and present a necessary and sufficient condition to achieve bipartite vector consensus in such networks. We study the network structures on which agents achieve zero consensus. We also present a convergence result on nonhomogenous matrix products which is of independent interest in matrix convergence theory. All the results hold true for the synchronous time update model as well in which all agents update their states simultaneously.

Abstract: We introduce distributional dynamic programming (DP) methods for optimizing statistical functionals of the return distribution, with standard reinforcement learning as a special case. Previous distributional DP methods could optimize the same class of expected utilities as classic DP. To go beyond, we combine distributional DP with stock augmentation, a technique previously introduced for classic DP in the context of risk-sensitive RL, where the MDP state is augmented with a statistic of the rewards obtained since the first time step. We find that a number of recently studied problems can be formulated as stock-augmented return distribution optimization, and we show that we can use distributional DP to solve them. We analyze distributional value and policy iteration, with bounds and a study of what objectives these distributional DP methods can or cannot optimize. We describe a number of applications outlining how to use distributional DP to solve different stock-augmented return distribution optimization problems, for example maximizing conditional value-at-risk, and homeostatic regulation. To highlight the practical potential of stock-augmented return distribution optimization and distributional DP, we introduce an agent that combines DQN and the core ideas of distributional DP, and empirically evaluate it for solving instances of the applications discussed.

Abstract: For intelligent transportation systems and autonomous vehicles to operate safely and efficiently, they must reliably predict the future motion and trajectory of surrounding agents within complex traffic environments. At the same time, the motion of these agents is inherently uncertain, making accurate prediction difficult. In this paper, we propose \textbf{TrajFlow}, a generative framework for estimating the occupancy density of dynamic agents. Our framework utilizes a causal encoder to extract semantically meaningful embeddings of the observed trajectory, as well as a normalizing flow to decode these embeddings and determine the most likely future location of an agent at some time point in the future. Our formulation differs from existing approaches because we model the marginal distribution of spatial locations instead of the joint distribution of unobserved trajectories. The advantages of a marginal formulation are numerous. First, we demonstrate that the marginal formulation produces higher accuracy on challenging trajectory forecasting benchmarks. Second, the marginal formulation allows for fully continuous sampling of future locations. Finally, marginal densities are better suited for downstream tasks as they allow for the computation of per-agent motion trajectories and occupancy grids, the two most commonly used representations for motion forecasting. We present a novel architecture based entirely on neural differential equations as an implementation of this framework and provide ablations to demonstrate the advantages of a continuous implementation over a more traditional discrete neural network based approach. The code is available at https://github.com/UMN-Choi-Lab/TrajFlow.

Abstract: Generating full-body human gestures based on speech signals remains challenges on quality and speed. Existing approaches model different body regions such as body, legs and hands separately, which fail to capture the spatial interactions between them and result in unnatural and disjointed movements. Additionally, their autoregressive/diffusion-based pipelines show slow generation speed due to dozens of inference steps. To address these two challenges, we propose GestureLSM, a flow-matching-based approach for Co-Speech Gesture Generation with spatial-temporal modeling. Our method i) explicitly model the interaction of tokenized body regions through spatial and temporal attention, for generating coherent full-body gestures. ii) introduce the flow matching to enable more efficient sampling by explicitly modeling the latent velocity space. To overcome the suboptimal performance of flow matching baseline, we propose latent shortcut learning and beta distribution time stamp sampling during training to enhance gesture synthesis quality and accelerate inference. Combining the spatial-temporal modeling and improved flow matching-based framework, GestureLSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on BEAT2 while significantly reducing inference time compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential for enhancing digital humans and embodied agents in real-world applications.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, reward signal for agents are exceedingly sparse, making it challenging to learn an effective reward function for reward shaping. To address this issue, the proposed approach in this paper performs reward shaping not only by utilizing non-zero-reward transitions but also by employing the \emph{Semi-Supervised Learning} (SSL) technique combined with a novel data augmentation to learn trajectory space representations from the majority of transitions, {i.e}., zero-reward transitions, thereby improving the efficacy of reward shaping. Experimental results in Atari and robotic manipulation demonstrate that our method outperforms supervised-based approaches in reward inference, leading to higher agent scores. Notably, in more sparse-reward environments, our method achieves up to twice the peak scores compared to supervised baselines. The proposed double entropy data augmentation enhances performance, showcasing a 15.8\% increase in best score over other augmentation methods

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large models, driven by their exceptional abilities in learning and generalization through large-scale pre-training, has reshaped the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-powered Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.

Abstract: To guarantee global coverage and ubiquitous connectivity, the Non-terrestrial Network (NTN) technology has been regarded as a key enabling technology in the Six Generation (6G) network, which consists of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), high-altitude platform (HAP), and satellite. It is noted that the unique characteristics of various NTN platforms directly impact the design and implementation of NTNs, which results in highly dynamic and heterogeneous networks. Even within the same tier, such as the space tier, the NTNs are developed based on different platforms including Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO). Therefore, distributed coordination among heterogeneous NTNs remains an important challenge. Although distributed learning framework finds a wide range of applications by leveraging rich distributed data and computation resources. The explicit and systematic analysis of the individual layers' challenges, and corresponding distributed coordination solutions in heterogeneous NTNs has not been proposed yet. In this article, we first summarize the unique characteristics of each NTN platform, and analyze the corresponding impact on the design and implementation of the NTN. We then identify the communication challenges of heterogeneous NTNs in individual layers, where the potential coordinated solutions are identified. We further illustrate the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithms tailored for coordinated solutions in heterogeneous NTNs. Last but not least, we present a case study of the user scheduling optimization problem in heterogeneous UAVs-based cellular networks, where the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) technique is developed to validate the effectiveness of distributed coordination in heterogeneous NTNs.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable software release decisions is critical in safety-critical domains such as automotive manufacturing. Release validation relies on large tabular datasets, yet manual analysis is slow, costly, and error-prone. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising automation potential, they face challenges in analytical reasoning, structured data handling, and ambiguity resolution. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based system for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and generates optimized Python code. Unlike traditional multi-agent or planning-based systems that can be slow, opaque, and costly to maintain, GateLens emphasizes speed, transparency, and reliability. Experimental results show that GateLens outperforms the existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) + Self-Consistency (SC) based system on real-world datasets, particularly in handling complex and ambiguous queries. Ablation studies confirm the essential role of the RA layer. Industrial deployment shows over 80% reduction in analysis time while maintaining high accuracy across test result interpretation, impact assessment, and release candidate evaluation. GateLens operates effectively in zero-shot settings without requiring few-shot examples or agent orchestration. This work advances deployable LLM system design by identifying key architectural features-intermediate formal representations, execution efficiency, and low configuration overhead-crucial for safety-critical industrial applications.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, paving the way for advanced intelligent agents capable of sophisticated reasoning, robust perception, and versatile action across diverse domains. As these agents increasingly drive AI research and practical applications, their design, evaluation, and continuous improvement present intricate, multifaceted challenges. This book provides a comprehensive overview, framing intelligent agents within modular, brain-inspired architectures that integrate principles from cognitive science, neuroscience, and computational research. We structure our exploration into four interconnected parts. First, we systematically investigate the modular foundation of intelligent agents, systematically mapping their cognitive, perceptual, and operational modules onto analogous human brain functionalities and elucidating core components such as memory, world modeling, reward processing, goal, and emotion. Second, we discuss self-enhancement and adaptive evolution mechanisms, exploring how agents autonomously refine their capabilities, adapt to dynamic environments, and achieve continual learning through automated optimization paradigms. Third, we examine multi-agent systems, investigating the collective intelligence emerging from agent interactions, cooperation, and societal structures. Finally, we address the critical imperative of building safe and beneficial AI systems, emphasizing intrinsic and extrinsic security threats, ethical alignment, robustness, and practical mitigation strategies necessary for trustworthy real-world deployment. By synthesizing modular AI architectures with insights from different disciplines, this survey identifies key research challenges and opportunities, encouraging innovations that harmonize technological advancement with meaningful societal benefit.

Abstract: REST APIs (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces) play a vital role in modern cloud-native applications. As these APIs grow in complexity and scale, ensuring their correctness and robustness becomes increasingly important. Automated testing is essential for identifying hidden bugs, particularly those that appear in edge cases or under unexpected inputs. However, creating comprehensive and effective test suites for REST APIs is challenging and often demands significant effort. In this paper, we investigate the use of large language model (LLM) systems, both single-agent and multi-agent setups, for amplifying existing REST API test suites. These systems generate additional test cases that aim to push the boundaries of the API, uncovering behaviors that might otherwise go untested. We present a comparative evaluation of the two approaches across several dimensions, including test coverage, bug detection effectiveness, and practical considerations such as computational cost and energy usage. Our evaluation demonstrates increased API coverage, identification of numerous bugs in the API under test, and insights into the computational cost and energy consumption of both approaches.

<title>The Cognitive Foundations of Economic Exchange: A Modular Framework Grounded in Behavioral Evidence</title>

Abstract: The origins of economic behavior remain unresolved-not only in the social sciences but also in AI, where dominant theories often rely on predefined incentives or institutional assumptions. Contrary to the longstanding myth of barter as the foundation of exchange, converging evidence from early human societies suggests that reciprocity-not barter-was the foundational economic logic, enabling communities to sustain exchange and social cohesion long before formal markets emerged. Yet despite its centrality, reciprocity lacks a simulateable and cognitively grounded account. Here, we introduce a minimal behavioral framework based on three empirically supported cognitive primitives-individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost--return sensitivity-that enable agents to participate in and sustain reciprocal exchange, laying the foundation for scalable economic behavior. These mechanisms scaffold the emergence of cooperation, proto-economic exchange, and institutional structure from the bottom up. By bridging insights from primatology, developmental psychology, and economic anthropology, this framework offers a unified substrate for modeling trust, coordination, and economic behavior in both human and artificial systems. For an interactive visualization of the framework, see: https://egil158.github.io/cogfoundations-econ/

Abstract: Motivated by group-project distribution, we introduce and study stable matching under the constraint of applicants needing to share a location to be matched with the same institute, which we call the Location-Restricted Stable Matching problem (LRSM). We show that finding a feasible matching is NP-hard, making finding a feasible and stable matching automatically NP-hard. We then analyze the subproblem where all the projects have the same capacity, and the applicant population of each location is a multiple of the universal project capacity, which mimics more realistic constraints and makes finding a feasible matching in P. Even under these conditions, a stable matching (a matching without blocking pairs) may not exist, so we look for a matching that minimizes the number of blocking pairs. We find that the blocking pair minimization problem for this subproblem is inapproximable within $|A|^{1-\epsilon}$ for $|A|$ agents and provide an $|A|$-approximation algorithm to show this result is almost tight. We extend this result to show that the problem of minimizing the number of agents in blocking pairs is also inapproximable within $|A|^{1-\epsilon}$, and since there are only $|A|$ agents, this result is also almost tight.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have recently emerged as an intriguing paradigm for human-computer interaction, capable of automatically executing user instructions to operate intelligent terminal devices. However, when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) instructions that violate environmental constraints or exceed the current capabilities of agents, GUI agents may suffer task breakdowns or even pose security threats. Therefore, effective OOD detection for GUI agents is essential. Traditional OOD detection methods perform suboptimally in this domain due to the complex embedding space and evolving GUI environments. In this work, we observe that the in-distribution input semantic space of GUI agents exhibits a clustering pattern with respect to the distance from the centroid. Based on the finding, we propose GEM, a novel method based on fitting a Gaussian mixture model over input embedding distances extracted from the GUI agent that reflect its capability boundary. Evaluated on eight datasets spanning smartphones, computers, and web browsers, our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 23.70\% over the best-performing baseline while only increasing training time by 4.9\% and testing time by 6.5\%. We also experimentally demonstrate that GEM can improve the step-wise success rate by 9.40\% by requesting assistance from the cloud model when encountering OOD samples. Analysis verifies the generalization ability of our method through experiments on nine different backbones. The codes are available at https://github.com/Wuzheng02/GEM-OODforGUIagents.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential across various domains, their applications in robotics remain largely limited to static prompt-based behaviors and still face challenges in complex tasks under zero-shot or few-shot settings. Inspired by human metacognitive learning and creative problem-solving, we address this limitation by exploring a fundamental question: Can LLMs be empowered with metacognitive capabilities to reason, reflect, and create, thereby enhancing their ability to perform robotic tasks with minimal demonstrations? In this paper, we present a framework that integrates metacognitive learning into LLM-powered multi-robot collaboration. The system equips the LLM-powered robotic agents with a skill decomposition and self-reflection mechanism that identifies modular skills from prior tasks, reflects on failures in unseen task scenarios, and synthesizes effective new solutions. We propose a more challenging robotic benchmark task and evaluate our framework on the existing benchmark and the novel task. Experimental results show that our metacognitive learning framework significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, we observe that the framework can generate solutions that differ from the ground truth yet still successfully complete the tasks. These findings support our hypothesis that metacognitive learning can foster creativity in robotic planning.

<title>Learning to Incentivize in Repeated Principal-Agent Problems with Adversarial Agent Arrivals</title>

Abstract: We initiate the study of a repeated principal-agent problem over a finite horizon $T$, where a principal sequentially interacts with $K\geq 2$ types of agents arriving in an adversarial order. At each round, the principal strategically chooses one of the $N$ arms to incentivize for an arriving agent of unknown type. The agent then chooses an arm based on its own utility and the provided incentive, and the principal receives a corresponding reward. The objective is to minimize regret against the best incentive in hindsight. Without prior knowledge of agent behavior, we show that the problem becomes intractable, leading to linear regret. We analyze two key settings where sublinear regret is achievable. In the first setting, the principal knows the arm each agent type would select greedily for any given incentive. Under this setting, we propose an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $O(\min\{\sqrt{KT\log N},K\sqrt{T}\})$ and provide a matching lower bound up to a $\log K$ factor. In the second setting, an agent's response varies smoothly with the incentive and is governed by a Lipschitz constant $L\geq 1$. Under this setting, we show that there is an algorithm with a regret bound of $\tilde{O}((LN)^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ and establish a matching lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we extend our algorithmic results for both settings by allowing the principal to incentivize multiple arms simultaneously in each round.

<title>Generative AI as a Pillar for Predicting 2D and 3D Wildfire Spread: Beyond Physics-Based Models and Traditional Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Wildfires increasingly threaten human life, ecosystems, and infrastructure, with events like the 2025 Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles County underscoring the urgent need for more advanced prediction frameworks. Existing physics-based and deep learning models struggle to capture dynamic wildfire spread across both 2D and 3D domains, especially when incorporating real-time, multimodal geospatial data. This paper explores how generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models-such as GANs, VAEs, and Transformers-can serve as transformative tools for wildfire prediction and simulation. These models offer superior capabilities in managing uncertainty, integrating multimodal inputs, and generating realistic, scalable wildfire scenarios. We introduce a new paradigm that leverages large language models (LLMs) for literature synthesis, classification, and knowledge extraction, conducting a systematic review of recent studies applying generative AI to fire prediction and monitoring. We highlight how generative approaches uniquely address challenges faced by traditional simulation and deep learning methods. Finally, we outline five key future directions for generative AI in wildfire management, including unified multimodal modeling of 2D and 3D dynamics, agentic AI systems and chatbots for decision intelligence, and real-time scenario generation on mobile devices, along with a discussion of critical challenges. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift toward multimodal generative frameworks to support proactive, data-informed wildfire response.

Abstract: Continual memory augmentation lets computer-using agents (CUAs) learn from prior interactions, but unvetted memories can encode domain-inappropriate or unsafe heuristics--spurious rules that drift from user intent and safety constraints. We introduce VerificAgent, a scalable oversight framework that treats persistent memory as an explicit alignment surface. VerificAgent combines (1) an expert-curated seed of domain knowledge, (2) iterative, trajectory-based memory growth during training, and (3) a post-hoc human fact-checking pass to sanitize accumulated memories before deployment. Evaluated on OSWorld productivity tasks and additional adversarial stress tests, VerificAgent improves task reliability, reduces hallucination-induced failures, and preserves interpretable, auditable guidance--without additional model fine-tuning. By letting humans correct high-impact errors once, the verified memory acts as a frozen safety contract that future agent actions must satisfy. Our results suggest that domain-scoped, human-verified memory offers a scalable oversight mechanism for CUAs, complementing broader alignment strategies by limiting silent policy drift and anchoring agent behavior to the norms and safety constraints of the target domain.

<title>MCA-Bench: A Multimodal Benchmark for Evaluating CAPTCHA Robustness Against VLM-based Attacks</title>

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and code are available online.

Abstract: The challenge of finding compromises between agent proposals is fundamental to AI subfields such as argumentation, mediation, and negotiation. Building on this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo, using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. A crucial step in this process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals remains an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a model that incorporates agent bounded rationality and uncertainty, and by developing AI methods to generate compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaborative document writing, such as the democratic drafting of a community constitution. Our approach uses natural language processing techniques and large language models to induce a semantic metric space over text. Based on this space, we design algorithms to suggest compromise points likely to receive broad support. To evaluate our methods, we simulate coalition formation processes and show that AI can facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, a domain where traditional tools are limited.

Abstract: Personalization, while extensively studied in conventional autonomous driving pipelines, has been largely overlooked in the context of end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD), despite its critical role in fostering user trust, safety perception, and real-world adoption. A primary bottleneck is the absence of large-scale real-world datasets that systematically capture driving preferences, severely limiting the development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale real-world dataset explicitly curated for personalized E2EAD, integrating comprehensive scene topology with rich dynamic context derived from agent dynamics and semantics inferred via a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM). We propose a hybrid annotation pipeline that combines behavioral analysis, rule-and-distribution-based heuristics, and subjective semantic modeling guided by VLM reasoning, with final refinement through human-in-the-loop verification. Building upon this dataset, we introduce the first standardized benchmark for systematically evaluating personalized E2EAD models. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art architectures demonstrate that incorporating personalized driving preferences significantly improves behavioral alignment with human demonstrations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities across mathematical, strategic, and linguistic tasks, yet little is known about how well they reason in dynamic, real-time, multi-agent scenarios, such as collaborative environments in which agents continuously adapt to each other's behavior, as in cooperative gameplay settings. In this paper, we bridge this gap by combining LLM-driven agents with strategic reasoning and real-time adaptation in cooperative, multi-agent environments grounded in game-theoretic principles such as belief consistency and Nash equilibrium. The proposed framework applies broadly to dynamic scenarios in which agents coordinate, communicate, and make decisions in response to continuously changing conditions. We provide real-time strategy refinement and adaptive feedback mechanisms that enable agents to dynamically adjust policies based on immediate contextual interactions, in contrast to previous efforts that evaluate LLM capabilities in static or turn-based settings. Empirical results show that our method achieves up to a 26\% improvement in return over PPO baselines in high-noise environments, while maintaining real-time latency under 1.05 milliseconds. Our approach improves collaboration efficiency, task completion rates, and flexibility, illustrating that game-theoretic guidance integrated with real-time feedback enhances LLM performance, ultimately fostering more resilient and flexible strategic multi-agent systems.

<title>Scaling LLM Planning: NL2FLOW for Parametric Problem Generation and Rigorous Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Effective agent performance relies on the ability to compose tools and agents into effective workflows. However, progress in Large Language Model (LLM) planning and reasoning is limited by the scarcity of scalable, reliable evaluation data. This study addresses this limitation by identifying a suitable workflow domain for LLM application. I introduce NL2Flow, a fully automated system for parametrically generating planning problems, which are expressed in natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL, and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. NL2Flow generates a dataset of 2296 low-difficulty problems in automated workflow generation and evaluates multiple open-sourced, instruct-tuned LLMs without task-specific optimization or architectural modifications. Results reveal that the highest performing model achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal plans, specifically for problems with feasible plans. Regression analysis shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is contingent on both model and prompt design. To investigate the potential of LLMs as natural language-to-JSON translators for workflow definition, and to facilitate integration with downstream symbolic computation tools and a symbolic planner, I evaluated the LLM's translation performance on natural language workflow descriptions. I observed that translating natural language into a JSON representation of a workflow problem yielded a lower success rate than generating a plan directly, suggesting that unnecessary decomposition of the reasoning task may degrade performance and highlighting the benefit of models capable of reasoning directly from natural language to action. As LLM reasoning scales to increasingly complex problems, understanding the shifting bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will be crucial.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling agents.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in machine learning, in practice, relevant datasets are often distributed among market competitors who are reluctant to share. To incentivize data sharing, recent works propose analytics markets, where multiple agents share features and are rewarded for improving the predictions of others. These rewards can be computed by treating features as players in a coalitional game, with solution concepts that yield desirable market properties. However, this setup incites agents to strategically replicate their data and act under multiple false identities to increase their own revenue and diminish that of others, limiting the viability of such markets in practice. In this work, we develop an analytics market robust to such strategic replication for supervised learning problems. We adopt Pearl's do-calculus from causal inference to refine the coalitional game by differentiating between observational and interventional conditional probabilities. As a result, we derive rewards that are replication-robust by design.

Abstract: Tick-sizes not only influence the granularity of the price formation process but also affect market agents' behavior. We investigate the disparity in the microstructural properties of the Limit Order Book (LOB) across a basket of assets with different relative tick-sizes. A key contribution of this study is the identification of several stylized facts, which are used to differentiate between large, medium, and small-tick assets, along with clear metrics for their measurement. We provide cross-asset visualizations to illustrate how these attributes vary with relative tick-size. Further, we propose a Hawkes Process model that {\color{black}not only fits well for large-tick assets, but also accounts for }sparsity, multi-tick level price moves, and the shape of the LOB in small-tick assets. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate the {\color{black} versatility} of the model and identify key variables that determine whether a simulated LOB resembles a large-tick or small-tick asset. Our tests show that stylized facts like sparsity, shape, and relative returns distribution can be smoothly transitioned from a large-tick to a small-tick asset using our model. We test this model's assumptions, showcase its challenges and propose questions for further directions in this area of research.

Abstract: With the development of large models and autonomous decision-making AI, agents are rapidly becoming the new entities of the internet, following mobile apps. However, existing internet infrastructure is primarily designed for human interaction, creating data silos, unfriendly interfaces, and high collaboration costs among agents, making it difficult to support the needs for large-scale agent interconnection and collaboration. The internet is undergoing a profound transformation, showing four core trends: agents replacing traditional software, universal agent interconnection, native protocol-based connections, and autonomous agent organization and collaboration. To align with these trends, Agent Network Protocol (ANP) proposes a new generation of communication protocols for the Agentic Web. ANP adheres to AI-native design, maintains compatibility with existing internet protocols, adopts a modular composable architecture, follows minimalist yet extensible principles, and enables rapid deployment based on existing infrastructure. Through a three-layer protocol system--identity and encrypted communication layer, meta-protocol negotiation layer, and application protocol layer--ANP. systematically solves the problems of agent identity authentication, dynamic negotiation, and capability discovery interoperability.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agents have shown impressive capabilities by interleaving internal reasoning with external tool use. However, as these agents are deployed in long-horizon workflows, such as coding for a big, long-term project, context management becomes a critical bottleneck. We introduce Git-Context-Controller (GCC), a structured context management framework inspired by software version control systems. GCC elevates context as versioned memory hierarchy like Git. It structures agent memory as a persistent file system with explicit operations: COMMIT, BRANCH, MERGE, and CONTEXT, enabling milestone-based checkpointing, exploration of alternative plans, and structured reflection. Our approach empowers agents to manage long-term goals, isolate architectural experiments, and recover or hand off memory across sessions and agents. Empirically, agents equipped with GCC achieve state-of-the-art performance on the SWE-Bench-Lite benchmark, resolving 48.00 of software bugs, outperforming 26 competitive systems. In a self-replication case study, a GCC-augmented agent builds a new CLI agent from scratch, achieving 40.7 task resolution, compared to only 11.7 without GCC. The code is released at: https://github.com/theworldofagents/GCC

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in multi-agent scenarios where coordination is crucial but not always assured. Previous studies indicate that the language used to frame strategic scenarios can influence cooperative behavior. This paper explores whether allowing agents to communicate amplifies these language-driven effects. Leveraging the FAIRGAME framework, we simulate one-shot and repeated games across different languages and models, both with and without communication. Our experiments, conducted with two advanced LLMs, GPT-4o and Llama 4 Maverick, reveal that communication significantly influences agent behavior, though its impact varies by language, personality, and game structure. These findings underscore the dual role of communication in fostering coordination and reinforcing biases.

<title>Benchmarking Partial Observability in Reinforcement Learning with a Suite of Memory-Improvable Domains</title>

Abstract: Mitigating partial observability is a necessary but challenging task for general reinforcement learning algorithms. To improve an algorithm's ability to mitigate partial observability, researchers need comprehensive benchmarks to gauge progress. Most algorithms tackling partial observability are only evaluated on benchmarks with simple forms of state aliasing, such as feature masking and Gaussian noise. Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of partial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown opponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two key properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to ensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the performance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors roughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where performance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with partial observability as opposed to other factors. We introduce best-practice guidelines for empirically benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial observability, as well as the open-source library POBAX: Partially Observable Benchmarks in JAX. We characterize the types of partial observability present in various environments and select representative environments for our benchmark. These environments include localization and mapping, visual control, games, and more. Additionally, we show that these tasks are all memory improvable and require hard-to-learn memory functions, providing a concrete signal for partial observability research. This framework includes recommended hyperparameters as well as algorithm implementations for fast, out-of-the-box evaluation, as well as highly performant environments implemented in JAX for GPU-scalable experimentation.

Abstract: The discipline of physics stands as a cornerstone of human intellect, driving the evolution of technology and deepening our understanding of the fundamental principles of the cosmos. Contemporary literature includes some works centered on the task of solving physics problems - a crucial domain of natural language reasoning. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of frontier LLMs in solving physics problems, both mathematical and descriptive. We also employ a plethora of inference-time techniques and agentic frameworks to improve the performance of the models. This includes the verification of proposed solutions in a cumulative fashion by other, smaller LLM agents, and we perform a comparative analysis of the performance that the techniques entail. There are significant improvements when the multi-agent framework is applied to problems that the models initially perform poorly on. Furthermore, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark for physics problems, ${\rm P{\small HYSICS}E{\small VAL}}$, consisting of 19,609 problems sourced from various physics textbooks and their corresponding correct solutions scraped from physics forums and educational websites. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/areebuzair/PhysicsEval.

Abstract: Code generation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the software development paradigm. Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.

Abstract: Hyperproperties for Time Window Temporal Logic (HyperTWTL) is a domain-specific formal specification language known for its effectiveness in compactly representing security, opacity, and concurrency properties for robotics applications. This paper focuses on HyperTWTL-constrained secure reinforcement learning (SecRL). Although temporal logic-constrained safe reinforcement learning (SRL) is an evolving research problem with several existing literature, there is a significant research gap in exploring security-aware reinforcement learning (RL) using hyperproperties. Given the dynamics of an agent as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and opacity/security constraints formalized as HyperTWTL, we propose an approach for learning security-aware optimal policies using dynamic Boltzmann softmax RL while satisfying the HyperTWTL constraints. The effectiveness and scalability of our proposed approach are demonstrated using a pick-up and delivery robotic mission case study. We also compare our results with two other baseline RL algorithms, showing that our proposed method outperforms them.

Abstract: Accurate link-level bicycling volume estimation is essential for sustainable urban transportation planning. However, many cities face significant challenges of high data sparsity due to limited bicycling count sensor coverage. To address this issue, we propose INSPIRE-GNN, a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-boosted hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework designed to optimize sensor placement and improve link-level bicycling volume estimation in data-sparse environments. INSPIRE-GNN integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based RL agent, enabling a data-driven strategic selection of sensor locations to maximize estimation performance. Applied to Melbourne's bicycling network, comprising 15,933 road segments with sensor coverage on only 141 road segments (99% sparsity) - INSPIRE-GNN demonstrates significant improvements in volume estimation by strategically selecting additional sensor locations in deployments of 50, 100, 200 and 500 sensors. Our framework outperforms traditional heuristic methods for sensor placement such as betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, observed bicycling activity and random placement, across key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Furthermore, our experiments benchmark INSPIRE-GNN against standard machine learning and deep learning models in the bicycle volume estimation performance, underscoring its effectiveness. Our proposed framework provides transport planners actionable insights to effectively expand sensor networks, optimize sensor placement and maximize volume estimation accuracy and reliability of bicycling data for informed transportation planning decisions.

Abstract: Active Geo-localization (AGL) is the task of localizing a goal, represented in various modalities (e.g., aerial images, ground-level images, or text), within a predefined search area. Current methods approach AGL as a goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a distance-based reward. They localize the goal by implicitly learning to minimize the relative distance from it. However, when distance estimation becomes challenging or when encountering unseen targets and environments, the agent exhibits reduced robustness and generalization ability due to the less reliable exploration strategy learned during training. In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL agent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards. Unlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic, enabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on effective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through extensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings, particularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.

Abstract: Power is a key concept in AI safety: power-seeking as an instrumental goal, sudden or gradual disempowerment of humans, power balance in human-AI interaction and international AI governance. At the same time, power as the ability to pursue diverse goals is essential for wellbeing.
  This paper explores the idea of promoting both safety and wellbeing by forcing AI agents explicitly to empower humans and to manage the power balance between humans and AI agents in a desirable way. Using a principled, partially axiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective function that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of human power. It takes into account humans' bounded rationality and social norms, and, crucially, considers a wide variety of possible human goals.
  We derive algorithms for computing that metric by backward induction or approximating it via a form of multi-agent reinforcement learning from a given world model. We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric in a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental sub-goals it will likely imply. Our cautious assessment is that softly maximizing suitable aggregate metrics of human power might constitute a beneficial objective for agentic AI systems that is safer than direct utility-based objectives.

Abstract: Standard regression techniques, while powerful, are often constrained by predefined, differentiable loss functions such as mean squared error. These functions may not fully capture the desired behavior of a system, especially when dealing with asymmetric costs or complex, non-differentiable objectives. In this paper, we explore an alternative paradigm: framing regression as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. We demonstrate this by treating a model's prediction as an action and defining a custom reward signal based on the prediction error, and we can leverage powerful RL algorithms to perform function approximation. Through a progressive case study of learning a noisy sine wave, we illustrate the development of an Actor-Critic agent, iteratively enhancing it with Prioritized Experience Replay, increased network capacity, and positional encoding to enable a capable RL agent for this regression task. Our results show that the RL framework not only successfully solves the regression problem but also offers enhanced flexibility in defining objectives and guiding the learning process.

<title>Optimal Messaging Strategy for Incentivizing Agents in Dynamic Systems</title>

Abstract: We consider a finite-horizon discrete-time dynamic system jointly controlled by a designer and one or more agents, where the designer can influence the agents' actions through selective information disclosure. At each time step, the designer sends a message to the agent(s) from a prespecified message space. The designer may also take an action that directly influences system dynamics and rewards. Each agent uses its received message (and its own information) to choose its action. We are interested in the setting where the designer would like to incentivize each agent to play a specific strategy. We consider a notion of incentive compatibility that is based on sequential rationality at each realization of the common information between the designer and the agent(s). Our objective is to find a messaging and action strategy for the designer that maximizes its total expected reward while incentivizing each agent to follow a prespecified strategy. Under certain assumptions on the information structure of the problem, we show that an optimal designer strategy can be computed using a backward inductive algorithm that solves a family of linear programs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, leading to a significant increase in user demand for LLM services. However, cloud-based LLM services often suffer from high latency, unstable responsiveness, and privacy concerns. Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually deployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data privacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications. Given the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical issue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an appropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable quality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously address the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and the dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM services. Due to the dynamic nature of the global state, we propose a dynamic state abstraction technique to compactly represent global state features with a heterogeneous graph attention network (HAN). Additionally, we introduce an action impact estimator and a tailored reward function to guide the DRL agent in maximizing QoS and preventing latency violations. Extensive experiments on both Poisson and real-world workloads demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly improves average QoS and computing resource efficiency compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have opened up greater opportunities to enable fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to behave as more powerful interactive agents through improved instruction-following ability. However, understanding how this impacts confidence calibration for reliable model output has not been researched in full. In this work, we examine various open-sourced LLMs, identifying significant calibration degradation after instruction tuning in each. Seeking a practical solution, we look towards label smoothing, which has been shown as an effective method to regularize for overconfident predictions but has yet to be widely adopted in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs. We first provide insight as to why label smoothing is sufficient to maintain calibration throughout the SFT process. However, settings remain where the effectiveness of smoothing is severely diminished, in particular the case of large vocabulary LLMs (LV-LLMs). We posit the cause to stem from the ability to become over-confident, which has a direct relationship with the hidden size and vocabulary size, and justify this theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we address an outstanding issue regarding the memory footprint of the cross-entropy loss computation in the label smoothed loss setting, designing a customized kernel to dramatically reduce memory consumption without sacrificing speed or performance in comparison to existing solutions for non-smoothed losses.

Abstract: In this work, we propose MetaAgent, an agentic paradigm inspired by the principle of learning-by-doing, where expertise is developed through hands-on practice and continual self-improvement. MetaAgent starts with a minimal workflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking abilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural language help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by a dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts self-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into concise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts. Besides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent knowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual, data-driven process as \textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent incrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing model parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging knowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp, MetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or exceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving agentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery. We provide our source codes in https://github.com/qhjqhj00/MetaAgent.

Abstract: The fast development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents provides a promising way for the realization of intelligent and customized wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a Wireless Multi-Agent System (WMAS), which can provide intelligent and customized services for different user equipment (UEs). Note that orchestrating multiple agents carries the risk of malfunction, and multi-agent conversations may fall into infinite loops. It is thus crucial to design a conversation topology for WMAS that enables agents to complete UE task requests with high accuracy and low conversation overhead. To address this issue, we model the multi-agent conversation topology as a directed acyclic graph and propose a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to optimize the adjacency matrix of this graph. As such, WMAS is capable of generating and self-optimizing multi-agent conversation topologies, enabling agents to effectively and collaboratively handle a variety of task requests from UEs. Simulation results across various task types demonstrate that WMAS can achieve higher task performance and lower conversation overhead compared to existing multi-agent systems. These results validate the potential of WMAS to enhance the intelligence of future wireless networks.

Abstract: Humans constantly generate a diverse range of tasks guided by internal motivations. While generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs) aim to simulate this complex behavior, it remains uncertain whether they operate on similar cognitive principles. To address this, we conducted a task-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of an LLM agent (GPT-4o). We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by psychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and cognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided to the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They produce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically biased toward abstraction. Interestingly, while the LLM's tasks were perceived as more fun and novel, this highlights a disconnect between its linguistic proficiency and its capacity to generate human-like, embodied goals.We conclude that there is a core gap between the value-driven, embodied nature of human cognition and the statistical patterns of LLMs, highlighting the necessity of incorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding into the design of more human-aligned agents.

<title>UAV-ON: A Benchmark for Open-World Object Goal Navigation with Aerial Agents</title>

Abstract: Aerial navigation is a fundamental yet underexplored capability in embodied intelligence, enabling agents to operate in large-scale, unstructured environments where traditional navigation paradigms fall short. However, most existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm, which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon, goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: Ransomware (RW) presents a significant and widespread threat in the digital landscape, necessitating effective countermeasures. Active cyber deception is a promising strategy to thwart RW and limiting its propagation by misleading it with false information and revealing its true behaviors. Furthermore, RW often acts as a communication conduit between attackers and defenders, allowing deception to return false data to attackers and deplete their resources. This paper introduces ranDecepter, a novel approach that combines active cyber deception with real-time analysis to enhance defenses against RW attacks. The ranDecepter identifies RW in real-time and isolates it within a deceptive environment, autonomously identifying critical elements in the RW code to create a loop mechanism. By repeatedly restarting the malware and transmitting counterfeit encryption information and secret keys to the attacker, it forces the attacker to store these fabricated details for each victim, thereby depleting their resources. Our comprehensive evaluation of ranDecepter, conducted using 1,134 real-world malware samples and twelve benign applications, demonstrates a remarkable 100% accuracy in RW identification, with no false positives and minimal impact on response times. Furthermore, within 24-hours, ranDecepter generates up to 9,223K entries in the attacker's database using 50 agents, showcasing its potential to undermine attacker resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in tackling agent-oriented tasks. Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges when deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent paradigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate action execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring long-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner and executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in agent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion trajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize high-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon decision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward PilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by progressive reinforcement learning. We first develop the model's ability to follow explicit guidance from global plans when addressing agent tasks. Subsequently, based on this foundation, we focus on optimizing the quality of generated plans. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's planning and execution coordination. Experiments indicate that PilotRL could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o by 3.60%, while showing a more substantial gain of 55.78% comparing to GPT-4o-mini at a comparable parameter scale.

Abstract: We present a Collaborative Agent-Based Framework for Multi-Image Reasoning. Our approach tackles the challenge of interleaved multimodal reasoning across diverse datasets and task formats by employing a dual-agent system: a language-based PromptEngineer, which generates context-aware, task-specific prompts, and a VisionReasoner, a large vision-language model (LVLM) responsible for final inference. The framework is fully automated, modular, and training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question answering, and free-form generation tasks involving one or multiple input images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively reason over multiple images when guided by informative prompts. Notably, Claude 3.7 achieves near-ceiling performance on challenging tasks such as TQA (99.13% accuracy), DocVQA (96.87%), and MMCoQA (75.28 ROUGE-L). We also explore how design choices-such as model selection, shot count, and input length-influence the reasoning performance of different LVLMs.

Abstract: Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits, i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods, enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are inherently limited in knowledge-intensive tasks due to their constrained capacity. While test-time computation offers a path to enhanced performance, most approaches treat reasoning as a fixed or heuristic process. In this work, we propose a new paradigm: viewing the model's internal reasoning, delimited by  and  tags, as a dynamic task vector machine. Rather than treating the content inside these tags as a mere trace of thought, we interpret the generation process itself as a mechanism through which the model \textbf{constructs and refines its own task vectors} on the fly. We developed a method to optimize this dynamic task vector machine through RLVR and successfully trained an agentic web-search model. We present Lucy, a 1.7B-parameter SLM that leverages this dynamic reasoning mechanism with MCP integration to achieve 78.3% accuracy on the SimpleQA benchmark, performing on par with much larger models such as DeepSeek-V3. This demonstrates that small models can rival large ones when equipped with structured, self-constructed task reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid iteration of autonomous vehicle (AV) deployments leads to increasing needs for building realistic and scalable multi-agent traffic simulators for efficient evaluation. Recent advances in this area focus on closed-loop simulators that enable generating diverse and interactive scenarios. This paper introduces Neural Interactive Agents (NIVA), a probabilistic framework for multi-agent simulation driven by a hierarchical Bayesian model that enables closed-loop, observation-conditioned simulation through autoregressive sampling from a latent, finite mixture of Gaussian distributions. We demonstrate how NIVA unifies preexisting sequence-to-sequence trajectory prediction models and emerging closed-loop simulation models trained on Next-token Prediction (NTP) from a Bayesian inference perspective. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that NIVA attains competitive performance compared to the existing method while providing embellishing control over intentions and driving styles.

<title>SA-GCS: Semantic-Aware Gaussian Curriculum Scheduling for UAV Vision-Language Navigation</title>

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable agents to accurately localize targets and plan flight paths in complex environments based on natural language instructions, with broad applications in intelligent inspection, disaster rescue, and urban monitoring. Recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has provided strong semantic understanding for this task, while reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising post-training strategy to further improve generalization. However, existing RL methods often suffer from inefficient use of training data, slow convergence, and insufficient consideration of the difficulty variation among training samples, which limits further performance improvement. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Semantic-Aware Gaussian Curriculum Scheduling (SA-GCS)}, a novel training framework that systematically integrates Curriculum Learning (CL) into RL. SA-GCS employs a Semantic-Aware Difficulty Estimator (SA-DE) to quantify the complexity of training samples and a Gaussian Curriculum Scheduler (GCS) to dynamically adjust the sampling distribution, enabling a smooth progression from easy to challenging tasks. This design significantly improves training efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances overall model performance. Extensive experiments on the CityNav benchmark demonstrate that SA-GCS consistently outperforms strong baselines across all metrics, achieves faster and more stable convergence, and generalizes well across models of different scales, highlighting its robustness and scalability. The implementation of our approach is publicly available.

<title>Cued-Agent: A Collaborative Multi-Agent System for Automatic Cued Speech Recognition</title>

Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/DennisHgj/Cued-Agent.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to multi-agent cooperation by implementing theory of mind (ToM) within active inference. ToM - the ability to understand that others can have differing knowledge and goals - enables agents to reason about others' beliefs while planning their own actions. Unlike previous active inference approaches to multi-agent cooperation, our method neither relies on task-specific shared generative models nor requires explicit communication, while being generalisable. In our framework, the ToM-equipped agent maintains distinct representations of its own and others' beliefs and goals. We extend the sophisticated inference tree-based planning algorithm to systematically explore joint policy spaces through recursive reasoning. Our approach is evaluated through collision avoidance and foraging task simulations. Results demonstrate that ToM-equipped agents cooperate better compared to non-ToM counterparts by being able to avoid collisions and reduce redundant efforts. Crucially, ToM agents accomplish this by inferring others' beliefs solely from observable behaviour. This work advances practical applications in artificial intelligence while providing computational insights into ToM.

Abstract: General AI Agents are increasingly recognized as foundational frameworks for the next generation of artificial intelligence, enabling complex reasoning, web interaction, coding, and autonomous research capabilities. However, current agent systems are either closed-source or heavily reliant on a variety of paid APIs and proprietary tools, limiting accessibility and reproducibility for the research community. In this work, we present \textbf{Cognitive Kernel-Pro}, a fully open-source and (to the maximum extent) free multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents. Within Cognitive Kernel-Pro, we systematically investigate the curation of high-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models, focusing on the construction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across four key domains: web, file, code, and general reasoning. Furthermore, we explore novel strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent robustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our 8B-parameter open-source model surpasses previous leading systems such as WebDancer and WebSailor, establishing a new performance standard for accessible, high-capability AI agents.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in graph-based learning by propagating information among neighbor nodes via predefined aggregation mechanisms. However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness -- some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second, predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph. ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.

Abstract: Modern cyber attacks unfold through multiple stages, requiring defenders to dynamically prioritize mitigations under uncertainty. While game-theoretic models capture attacker-defender interactions, existing approaches often rely on static assumptions and lack integration with real-time threat intelligence, limiting their adaptability. This paper presents CyGATE, a game-theoretic framework modeling attacker-defender interactions, using large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance tactic selection and patch prioritization. Applied to a two-agent scenario, CyGATE frames cyber conflicts as a partially observable stochastic game (POSG) across Cyber Kill Chain stages. Both agents use belief states to navigate uncertainty, with the attacker adapting tactics and the defender re-prioritizing patches based on evolving risks and observed adversary behavior. The framework's flexible architecture enables extension to multi-agent scenarios involving coordinated attackers, collaborative defenders, or complex enterprise environments with multiple stakeholders. Evaluated in a dynamic patch scheduling scenario, CyGATE effectively prioritizes high-risk vulnerabilities, enhancing adaptability through dynamic threat integration, strategic foresight by anticipating attacker moves under uncertainty, and efficiency by optimizing resource use.

<title>Pro2Guard: Proactive Runtime Enforcement of LLM Agent Safety via Probabilistic Model Checking</title>

arXiv:2508.00500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit powerful autonomous capabilities across domains such as robotics, virtual assistants, and web automation. However, their stochastic behavior introduces significant safety risks that are difficult to anticipate. Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as AgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond only when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems lack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime enforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis. Pro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it anticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe states, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted risk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity checks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability while approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard extensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and autonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early on up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes (e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to 80.4% task completion. In autonomous driving scenarios, Pro2Guard achieves 100% prediction of traffic law violations and collisions, anticipating risks up to 38.66 seconds ahead.

<title>Multi-Agent Game Generation and Evaluation via Audio-Visual Recordings</title>

Abstract: While AI excels at generating text, audio, images, and videos, creating interactive audio-visual content such as video games remains challenging. Current LLMs can generate JavaScript games and animations, but lack automated evaluation metrics and struggle with complex content that normally requires teams of humans working for many months (multi-shot, multi-agents) using assets made by artists. To tackle these issues, we built a new metric and a multi-agent system.
  We propose AVR-Eval, a relative metric for multimedia content quality using Audio-Visual Recordings (AVRs). An omni-modal model (processing text, video, and audio) compares the AVRs of two contents, with a text model reviewing evaluations to determine superiority. We show that AVR-Eval properly identifies good from broken or mismatched content.
  We built AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system generating JavaScript code from a bank of multimedia assets (audio, images, 3D models). The coding agent selects relevant assets, generates multiple initial codes, uses AVR-Eval to identify the best version, and iteratively improves it through omni-modal agent feedback from the AVR.
  We run experiments on games and animations with AVR-Eval (win rate of content A against B). We find that content generated by AVR-Agent has a significantly higher win rate against content made through one-shot generation. However, models struggle to leverage custom assets and AVR feedback effectively, showing no higher win rate. This reveals a critical gap: while humans benefit from high-quality assets and audio-visual feedback, current coding models do not seem to utilize these resources as effectively, highlighting fundamental differences between human and machine content creation approaches.

Abstract: The growing threat of low-cost kamikaze drone swarms poses a critical challenge to modern defense systems demanding rapid and strategic decision-making to prioritize interceptions across multiple effectors and high-value target zones. In this work, we present a case study demonstrating the practical advantages of reinforcement learning in addressing this challenge. We introduce a high-fidelity simulation environment that captures realistic operational constraints, within which a decision-level reinforcement learning agent learns to coordinate multiple effectors for optimal interception prioritization. Operating in a discrete action space, the agent selects which drone to engage per effector based on observed state features such as positions, classes, and effector status. We evaluate the learned policy against a handcrafted rule-based baseline across hundreds of simulated attack scenarios. The reinforcement learning based policy consistently achieves lower average damage and higher defensive efficiency in protecting critical zones. This case study highlights the potential of reinforcement learning as a strategic layer within defense architectures, enhancing resilience without displacing existing control systems. All code and simulation assets are publicly released for full reproducibility, and a video demonstration illustrates the policy's qualitative behavior.

<title>Putting Perspective into OWL [sic]: Complexity-Neutral Standpoint Reasoning for Ontology Languages via Monodic S5 over Counting Two-Variable First-Order Logic (Extended Version with Appendix)</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00653</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00653</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standpoint extensions of knowledge representation formalisms have been recently introduced as a means to incorporate multi-perspective modelling and reasoning through modal operators that attribute pieces of knowledge to specific entities or agents. In these extensions, the integration between conceptual modelling and perspective annotations can vary in strength, with monodic standpoint extensions offering a well-balanced approach. They allow for advanced modelling features, such as the expression of rigid concepts, while maintaining desirable reasoning complexity.
  We consider the extension of C2--the counting two-variable fragment of first-order logic--by monodic standpoints. At the heart of our work is a polynomial-time translation of formulas in this extended formalism into standard, standpoint-free C2, a result that relies on intricate model-theoretic arguments. Thanks to this translation, the satisfiability problem remains at the same complexity level: NExpTime-complete, as in plain C2. Since our formalism subsumes monodic S5 over C2, this result also marks a substantial advancement in the study of first-order modal logics.
  From a practical standpoint, this means that highly expressive description logics such as SHOIQBs and SROIQBs--which underpin the widely adopted OWL 1 and OWL 2 ontology languages standardised by the W3C--can be extended with monodic standpoints without increasing the standard reasoning complexity.
  We further prove that NExpTime-hardness arises even in significantly less expressive description logics, as long as they include both nominals and monodic standpoints. Moreover, we show that if the monodicity restriction is relaxed even slightly in the presence of inverse roles, functionality, and nominals, the satisfiability problem becomes undecidable.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine has enabled impressive capabilities, yet a critical gap remains in their ability to perform systematic, transparent, and verifiable reasoning, a cornerstone of clinical practice. This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image, code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60 seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges, including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust, and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.

Abstract: We introduce JSON Bag-of-Tokens model (JSON-Bag) as a method to generically represent game trajectories by tokenizing their JSON descriptions and apply Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) as distance metric for them. Using a prototype-based nearest-neighbor search (P-NNS), we evaluate the validity of JSON-Bag with JSD on six tabletop games -- \textit{7 Wonders}, \textit{Dominion}, \textit{Sea Salt and Paper}, \textit{Can't Stop}, \textit{Connect4}, \textit{Dots and boxes} -- each over three game trajectory classification tasks: classifying the playing agents, game parameters, or game seeds that were used to generate the trajectories.
  Our approach outperforms a baseline using hand-crafted features in the majority of tasks. Evaluating on N-shot classification suggests using JSON-Bag prototype to represent game trajectory classes is also sample efficient. Additionally, we demonstrate JSON-Bag ability for automatic feature extraction by treating tokens as individual features to be used in Random Forest to solve the tasks above, which significantly improves accuracy on underperforming tasks. Finally, we show that, across all six games, the JSD between JSON-Bag prototypes of agent classes highly correlates with the distances between agents' policies.

Abstract: Generative agents powered by Large Language Models demonstrate human-like characteristics through sophisticated natural language interactions. Their ability to assume roles and personalities based on predefined character biographies has positioned them as cost-effective substitutes for human participants in social science research. This paper explores the validity of such persona-based agents in representing human populations; we recreate the HEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 powered agents, conducting factor analysis on their responses, and comparing these results to the original findings presented by Ashton, Lee, & Goldberg in 2004. Our results found 1) a coherent and reliable personality structure was recoverable from the agents' responses demonstrating partial alignment to the HEXACO framework. 2) the derived personality dimensions were consistent and reliable within GPT-4, when coupled with a sufficiently curated population, and 3) cross-model analysis revealed variability in personality profiling, suggesting model-specific biases and limitations. We discuss the practical considerations and challenges encountered during the experiment. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the potential benefits and limitations of using generative agents in social science research and provides useful guidance on designing consistent and representative agent personas to maximise coverage and representation of human personality traits.

arXiv:2508.00743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions, iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional online RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized models (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models (e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g., MedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of retrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, particularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility.

Abstract: Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian (3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to capture goal image at arbitrary pose.

Abstract: Many complex systems - be they financial, natural or social - are composed by units - such as stocks, neurons or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationships between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at providing an answer within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing. Briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph, by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series share a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not - and, in case, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, the structure of the negative subgraph being more prone to inter-subject variability than the complementary, positive subgraph. At the mesoscopic level, instead, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.

However, the high sensitivity to market noise undermines the performance of LLM-based trading systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-agent system featuring an internal competitive mechanism inspired by modern corporate management structures. The system consists of two specialized teams: (1) Data Team - responsible for processing and condensing massive market data into diversified text factors, ensuring they fit the model's constrained context. (2) Research Team - tasked with making parallelized multipath trading decisions based on deep research methods. The core innovation lies in implementing a real-time evaluation and ranking mechanism within each team, driven by authentic market feedback. Each agent's performance undergoes continuous scoring and ranking, with only outputs from top-performing agents being adopted. The design enables the system to adaptively adjust to dynamic environment, enhances robustness against market noise and ultimately delivers superior trading performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system significantly outperforms prevailing multiagent systems and traditional quantitative investment methods across diverse evaluation metrics.

Abstract: In economies without monetary transfers, token systems serve as an alternative to sustain cooperation, alleviate free riding, and increase efficiency. This paper studies whether a token-based economy can be effective in marketplaces with thin exogenous supply. We consider a marketplace in which at each time period one agent requests a service, one agent provides the service, and one token (artificial currency) is used to pay for service provision. The number of tokens each agent has represents the difference between the amount of service provisions and service requests by the agent. We are interested in the behavior of this economy when very few agents are available to provide the requested service. Since balancing the number of tokens across agents is key to sustain cooperation, the agent with the minimum amount of tokens is selected to provide service among the available agents. When exactly one random agent is available to provide service, we show that the token distribution is unstable. However, already when just two random agents are available to provide service, the token distribution is stable, in the sense that agents' token balance is unlikely to deviate much from their initial endowment, and agents return to their initial endowment in finite expected time. Our results mirror the power of two choices paradigm in load balancing problems. Supported by numerical simulations using kidney exchange data, our findings suggest that token systems may generate efficient outcomes in kidney exchange marketplaces by sustaining cooperation between hospitals.

Abstract: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) navigation agents can enhance user experience in communication, entertainment, and productivity by streamlining workflows and reducing manual intervention. However, prior GUI agents often trained with datasets comprising tasks that can be completed within a single app, leading to poor performance in cross-app navigation. To address this problem, we present GUIOdyssey, a comprehensive dataset for cross-app mobile GUI navigation. GUIOdyssey comprises 8,334 episodes with an average of 15.3 steps per episode, covering 6 mobile devices, 212 distinct apps, and 1,357 app combinations. Each step is enriched with detailed semantic reasoning annotations, which aid the model in building cognitive processes and enhancing its reasoning abilities for complex cross-app tasks. Building on GUIOdyssey, we develop OdysseyAgent, an exploratory multimodal agent for long-step cross-app navigation equipped with a history resampler module that efficiently attends to historical screenshot tokens, balancing performance and inference speed. Extensive experiments conducted in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios validate the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we demonstrate that historial information involving actions, screenshots and context in our dataset can significantly enhances OdysseyAgent's performance on complex cross-app tasks.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a powerful framework for training AI agents to coordinate with human partners. However, DRL faces two critical challenges in human-AI coordination (HAIC): sparse rewards and unpredictable human behaviors. These challenges significantly limit DRL to identify effective coordination policies, due to its impaired capability of optimizing exploration and exploitation. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative behavior- and context-aware reward (BCR) for DRL, which optimizes exploration and exploitation by leveraging human behaviors and contextual information in HAIC. Our BCR consists of two components: (i) A novel dual intrinsic rewarding scheme to enhance exploration. This scheme composes an AI self-motivated intrinsic reward and a human-motivated intrinsic reward, which are designed to increase the capture of sparse rewards by a logarithmic-based strategy; and (ii) A new context-aware weighting mechanism for the designed rewards to improve exploitation. This mechanism helps the AI agent prioritize actions that better coordinate with the human partner by utilizing contextual information that can reflect the evolution of learning. Extensive simulations in the Overcooked environment demonstrate that our approach can increase the cumulative sparse rewards by approximately 20%, and improve the sample efficiency by around 38% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Cooperative mission planning for heterogeneous teams of mobile robots presents a unique set of challenges, particularly when operating under communication constraints and limited computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose the Cooperative and Asynchronous Transformer-based Mission Planning (CATMiP) framework, which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to coordinate distributed decision making among agents with diverse sensing, motion, and actuation capabilities, operating under sporadic ad hoc communication. A Class-based Macro-Action Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (CMacDec-POMDP) is also formulated to effectively model asynchronous decision-making for heterogeneous teams of agents. The framework utilizes an asynchronous centralized training and distributed execution scheme, enabled by the proposed Asynchronous Multi-Agent Transformer (AMAT) architecture. This design allows a single trained model to generalize to larger environments and accommodate varying team sizes and compositions. We evaluate CATMiP in a 2D grid-world simulation environment and compare its performance against planning-based exploration methods. Results demonstrate CATMiP's superior efficiency, scalability, and robustness to communication dropouts and input noise, highlighting its potential for real-world heterogeneous mobile robot systems. The code is available at https://github.com/mylad13/CATMiP

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have evolved to intelligently process information, make decisions, and interact with users or tools. A key capability is the integration of long-term memory capabilities, enabling these agents to draw upon historical interactions and knowledge. However, the growing memory size and need for semantic structuring pose significant challenges. In this work, we propose an autonomous memory augmentation approach, MemInsight, to enhance semantic data representation and retrieval mechanisms. By leveraging autonomous augmentation to historical interactions, LLM agents are shown to deliver more accurate and contextualized responses. We empirically validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in three task scenarios; conversational recommendation, question answering and event summarization. On the LLM-REDIAL dataset, MemInsight boosts persuasiveness of recommendations by up to 14%. Moreover, it outperforms a RAG baseline by 34% in recall for LoCoMo retrieval. Our empirical results show the potential of MemInsight to enhance the contextual performance of LLM agents across multiple tasks.

Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to introduce a transfer learning-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methodology that is able to optimise the geometry of any airfoil based on concomitant aerodynamic and structural integrity criteria. To showcase the method, we aim to maximise the lift-to-drag ratio $C_L/C_D$ while preserving the structural integrity of the airfoil -- as modelled by its maximum thickness -- and train the DRL agent using a list of different transfer learning (TL) strategies. The performance of the DRL agent is compared with Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), a traditional gradient-free optimisation method. Results indicate that DRL agents are able to perform purely aerodynamic and hybrid aerodynamic/structural shape optimisation, that the DRL approach outperforms PSO in terms of computational efficiency and aerodynamic improvement, and that the TL-enhanced DRL agent achieves performance comparable to the DRL one, while further saving substantial computational resources.

Abstract: Vector indexing enables semantic search over diverse corpora and has become an important interface to databases for both users and AI agents. Efficient vector search requires deep optimizations in database systems. This has motivated a new class of specialized vector databases that optimize for vector search quality and cost. Instead, we argue that a scalable, high-performance, and cost-efficient vector search system can be built inside a cloud-native operational database like Azure Cosmos DB while leveraging the benefits of a distributed database such as high availability, durability, and scale. We do this by deeply integrating DiskANN, a state-of-the-art vector indexing library, inside Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL. This system uses a single vector index per partition stored in existing index trees, and kept in sync with underlying data. It supports < 20ms query latency over an index spanning 10 million vectors, has stable recall over updates, and offers approximately 43x and 12x lower query cost compared to Pinecone and Zilliz serverless enterprise products. It also scales out to billions of vectors via automatic partitioning. This convergent design presents a point in favor of integrating vector indices into operational databases in the context of recent debates on specialized vector databases, and offers a template for vector indexing in other databases.

Abstract: Predicting the motion of other agents in a scene is highly relevant for autonomous driving, as it allows a self-driving car to anticipate. Inspired by the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Unlike existing encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that the model is always provided with up-to-date information, thereby enhancing performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the model the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future and further improves performance. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.

Abstract: Machine learning has been widely used to optimize complex engineering workflows across numerous domains. In the context of integrated circuit design, modern flows (e.g., going from a register-transfer level netlist to physical layouts) involve extensive configuration via thousands of parameters, and small changes to these parameters can have large downstream impacts on desired outcomes - namely design performance, power, and area. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for learning and reasoning within such high-dimensional optimization tasks. In this work, we introduce ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent that automates parameter tuning in an open-source hardware design flow. ORFS-agent adaptively explores parameter configurations, demonstrating clear improvements over standard Bayesian optimization approaches in terms of resource efficiency and final design metrics. Our empirical evaluations on two different technology nodes and a range of circuit benchmarks indicate that ORFS-agent can improve both routed wirelength and effective clock period by over 13%, all while using 40% fewer optimization iterations. Moreover, by following natural language objectives to trade off certain metrics for others, ORFS-agent demonstrates a flexible and interpretable framework for multi-objective optimization. Crucially, RFS-agent is modular and model-agnostic, and can be plugged in to any frontier LLM without any further fine-tuning.

Abstract: Scientific progress increasingly relies on effective collaboration among researchers, a dynamic that large language models (LLMs) have only begun to emulate. While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain. Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics in LLM-based autonomous research.

<title>Curious Causality-Seeking Agents Learn Meta Causal World</title>

Abstract: When building a world model, a common assumption is that the environment has a single, unchanging underlying causal rule, like applying Newton's laws to every situation. In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a \textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3) iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously unseen contexts.

We introduce and explore information processes -- stochastic processes produced by cognitive agents in real-time as they interact with and interpret incoming stimuli. We provide basic results on the ergodicity and semantics of the resulting time series of Shannon information measures that monitor an agent's adapting view of uncertainty and structural correlation in its environment.

Abstract: Conversations transform individual knowledge into collective insight, allowing groups of humans and increasingly groups of artificial intelligence (AI) agents to collaboratively solve complex problems. Whether interactions between AI agents can replicate the synergy observed in human discussions remains an open question. To investigate this, we systematically compared four conversational configurations: pairs of large language models (LLM-LLM), trios of LLMs, trios of humans, and mixed human-LLM pairs. After agents answered questions individually, they engaged in open-ended discussions and then reconsidered their initial answers. Interactions involving humans consistently led to accuracy improvements after the conversations, benefiting both stronger and weaker participants. By contrast, purely LLM-based pairs and trios exhibited declines in accuracy, demonstrating limited conversational synergy. Analysis of participants' confidence and answer-switching behavior revealed that knowledge diversity is a critical factor enabling collaborative improvement. Crucially, the lack of gains in LLM-LLM interactions did not stem from a fundamental limitation of the models' ability to collaborate, but from highly similar knowledge states that left little room for productive exchange. Our findings argue for a paradigm shift in AI development: rather than optimizing individual models solely for standalone performance, explicitly cultivating diversity across agents, even at the cost of slightly lower individual accuracy, may yield AI collaborators that are more effective in group settings with humans or other AI systems.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enhance user experience through multi-turn interactions, yet evaluating CRS remains challenging. User simulators can provide comprehensive evaluations through interactions with CRS, but building realistic and diverse simulators is difficult. While recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate user interactions, they still fall short in emulating individual real users across diverse scenarios and lack explicit rating mechanisms for quantitative evaluation. To address these gaps, we propose RecUserSim, an LLM agent-based user simulator with enhanced simulation realism and diversity while providing explicit scores. RecUserSim features several key modules: a profile module for defining realistic and diverse user personas, a memory module for tracking interaction history and discovering unknown preferences, and a core action module inspired by Bounded Rationality theory that enables nuanced decision-making while generating more fine-grained actions and personalized responses. To further enhance output control, a refinement module is designed to fine-tune final responses. Experiments demonstrate that RecUserSim generates diverse, controllable outputs and produces realistic, high-quality dialogues, even with smaller base LLMs. The ratings generated by RecUserSim show high consistency across different base LLMs, highlighting its effectiveness for CRS evaluation.

Abstract: Background: Globally we face a projected shortage of 11 million healthcare practitioners by 2030, and administrative burden consumes 50% of clinical time. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help alleviate these problems. However, no end-to-end autonomous large language model (LLM)-based AI system has been rigorously evaluated in real-world clinical practice. In this study, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function autonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We retrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic and board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth encounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan consistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based adjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic and clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2% of cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not supported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI performance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%; the diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this first large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong diagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI performance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians. These findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical decision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare workforce shortages.

Abstract: Scientific sketches (e.g., models) offer a powerful lens into students' conceptual understanding, yet AI-powered automated assessment of such free-form, visually diverse artifacts remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions often treat sketch evaluation as either an image classification task or monolithic vision-language models, which lack interpretability, pedagogical alignment, and adaptability across cognitive levels. To address these limitations, we present SketchMind, a cognitively grounded, multi-agent framework for evaluating and improving student-drawn scientific sketches. SketchMind comprises modular agents responsible for rubric parsing, sketch perception, cognitive alignment, and iterative feedback with sketch modification, enabling personalized and transparent evaluation. We evaluate SketchMind on a curated dataset of 3,575 student-generated sketches across six science assessment items with different highest order of Bloom's level that require students to draw models to explain phenomena. Compared to baseline GPT-4o performance without SRG (average accuracy: 55.6%), and with SRG integration achieves 77.1% average accuracy (+21.4% average absolute gain). We also demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration with SRG enhances SketchMind performance, for example, GPT-4.1 gains an average 8.9% increase in sketch prediction accuracy, outperforming single-agent pipelines across all items. Human evaluators rated the feedback and co-created sketches generated by \textsc{SketchMind} with GPT-4.1, which achieved an average of 4.1 out of 5, significantly higher than those of baseline models (e.g., 2.3 for GPT-4o). Experts noted the system's potential to meaningfully support conceptual growth through guided revision. Our code and (pending approval) dataset will be released to support reproducibility and future research in AI-driven education.

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis. Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs' hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

Our three-tier architecture employs base RL agents to process hybrid data, meta-agents to aggregate their decisions, and a super-agent to merge decisions based on market data and sentiment analysis. Evaluated on data from 2018 to 2024, after training on 2000-2017, the framework achieves a 26% annualized return and a Sharpe ratio of 1.2, outperforming equal-weighted and S&amp;P 500 benchmarks. Key contributions include scalable cross-modal integration, a hierarchical RL structure for enhanced stability, and open-source reproducibility.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents transformative opportunities for education, generating numerous novel application scenarios. However, significant challenges remain: evaluation metrics vary substantially across different educational scenarios, while many emerging scenarios lack appropriate assessment metrics. Current benchmarks predominantly measure general intelligence rather than pedagogical capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce ELMES, an open-source automated evaluation framework specifically designed for assessing LLMs in educational settings. ELMES features a modular architecture that enables researchers to create dynamic, multi-agent dialogues through simple configuration files, facilitating flexible scenario design without requiring extensive programming expertise. The framework incorporates a hybrid evaluation engine that objectively quantifies traditionally subjective pedagogical metrics using an LLM-as-a-Judge methodology. We conduct systematic benchmarking of state-of-the-art LLMs across four critical educational scenarios: Knowledge Point Explanation, Guided Problem-Solving Teaching, Interdisciplinary Lesson Plan Generation, and Contextualized Question Generation, employing fine-grained metrics developed in collaboration with education specialists. Our results demonstrate distinct capability distributions among models, revealing context-specific strengths and limitations.

Abstract: Since the advent of autonomous driving technology, it has experienced remarkable progress over the last decade. However, most existing research still struggles to address the challenges posed by environments where multiple vehicles have to interact seamlessly. This study aims to integrate causal learning with reinforcement learning-based methods by leveraging causal disentanglement representation learning (CDRL) to identify and extract causal features that influence optimal decision-making in autonomous vehicles. These features are then incorporated into graph neural network-based reinforcement learning algorithms to enhance decision-making in complex traffic scenarios. By using causal features as inputs, the proposed approach enables the optimization of vehicle behavior at an unsignalized intersection. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the highest average reward during training and our approach significantly outperforms other learning-based methods in several key metrics such as collision rate and average cumulative reward during testing. This study provides a promising direction for advancing multi-agent autonomous driving systems and make autonomous vehicles' navigation safer and more efficient in complex traffic environments.

<title>Beyond Rigid AI: Towards Natural Human-Machine Symbiosis for Interoperative Surgical Assistance</title>

Abstract: Emerging surgical data science and robotics solutions, especially those designed to provide assistance in situ, require natural human-machine interfaces to fully unlock their potential in providing adaptive and intuitive aid. Contemporary AI-driven solutions remain inherently rigid, offering limited flexibility and restricting natural human-machine interaction in dynamic surgical environments. These solutions rely heavily on extensive task-specific pre-training, fixed object categories, and explicit manual-prompting. This work introduces a novel Perception Agent that leverages speech-integrated prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), segment anything model (SAM), and any-point tracking foundation models to enable a more natural human-machine interaction in real-time intraoperative surgical assistance. Incorporating a memory repository and two novel mechanisms for segmenting unseen elements, Perception Agent offers the flexibility to segment both known and unseen elements in the surgical scene through intuitive interaction. Incorporating the ability to memorize novel elements for use in future surgeries, this work takes a marked step towards human-machine symbiosis in surgical procedures. Through quantitative analysis on a public dataset, we show that the performance of our agent is on par with considerably more labor-intensive manual-prompting strategies. Qualitatively, we show the flexibility of our agent in segmenting novel elements (instruments, phantom grafts, and gauze) in a custom-curated dataset. By offering natural human-machine interaction and overcoming rigidity, our Perception Agent potentially brings AI-based real-time assistance in dynamic surgical environments closer to reality.

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia. As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs, aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

<title>Assessing the Alignment of Automated Vehicle Decisions with Human Reasons</title>

Abstract: A key challenge in deploying automated vehicles (AVs) is ensuring they make appropriate decisions in ethically challenging everyday driving situations. While much attention has been paid to rare, high-stakes dilemmas such as trolley problems, similar tensions also arise in routine scenarios, such as navigating empty intersections, where multiple human considerations, including legality and comfort, often conflict. Current AV planning systems typically rely on rigid rules, which struggle to balance these competing considerations and can lead to behaviour that misaligns with human expectations. This paper proposes a novel reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework that operationalises the tracking condition of Meaningful Human Control (MHC). The framework models the reasons of human agents, such as regulatory compliance, as quantifiable functions and evaluates how well candidate AV trajectories align with these reasons. By assigning adjustable weights to agent priorities and integrating a balance function to discourage the exclusion of any agent, the framework supports interpretable decision evaluation. Through a real-world-inspired overtaking scenario, we show how this approach reveals tensions, for instance between regulatory compliance, efficiency, and comfort. The framework functions as a modular evaluation layer over existing planning algorithms. It offers a transparent tool for assessing ethical alignment in everyday scenarios and provides a practical step toward implementing MHC in real-world AV deployment.

Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many risks. In this work, we identify the 3 levels of autonomous AI. We are of the position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks, especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other risks in the appendix.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent. Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies, highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions, they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world conditions.

<title>Designing Dynamic Pricing for Bike-sharing Systems via Differentiable Agent-based Simulation</title>

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100 parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations, resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting appropriate initial conditions.

<title>SWE-Debate: Competitive Multi-Agent Debate for Software Issue Resolution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.23348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Issue resolution has made remarkable progress thanks to the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recently, agent-based frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks. While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and outperforms baselines by a large margin.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in software issue resolution, leveraging advanced techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, current agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts. Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes. Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6% Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks. Our approach establishes a new paradigm in which automated software engineering agents systematically accumulate and leverage repair expertise, fundamentally shifting from trial-and-error exploration to strategic, experience-driven issue resolution.

Abstract: Software issue resolution is a critical challenge in software engineering and has garnered increasing attention in recent years. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), substantial progress has been made in addressing real-world software engineering tasks. Recent studies have introduced ensemble reasoning techniques to enhance the performance of LLM-based issue resolution. However, existing prompting-based methods still face limitations in effectively exploring large ensemble spaces and lack the capacity for repository-level understanding, both of which constrain their overall effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Trae Agent, the first agent-based ensemble reasoning approach for repository-level issue resolution. Trae Agent formulates our goal as an optimal solution search problem and addresses two key challenges, i.e., large ensemble spaces and repository-level understanding, through modular agents for generation, pruning, and selection. We conduct extensive experiments using three leading LLMs on the widely-adopted SWE-bench benchmark, comparing Trae Agent against four state-of-the-art ensemble reasoning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Trae Agent consistently achieves superior performance, with an average improvement of 10.22% over all baselines in terms of Pass@1. Trae Agent has achieved first place on the SWE-bench Verified leaderboard, with a notable Pass@1 score of 75.20%. We are pleased to release Trae Agent as an open-source project to support the research community, with all resources available at https://github.com/bytedance/trae-agent.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical. However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data, which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training. Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective, bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further validating its practical applicability.

Our aim is to drive the transformative evolution of MR technologies that prioritize human-centric innovation, fostering richer digital connections. We advocate for MR systems that enhance social interaction and collaboration between humans and virtual autonomous agents, ensuring inclusivity, ethical design and psychological safety in the process.

Abstract: Achieving safety in autonomous multi-agent systems, particularly in time-critical tasks like rendezvous, is a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust risk framework for analyzing cascading failures in multi-agent rendezvous. To capture the complex interactions between network connectivity, system dynamics, and communication delays, we use a time-delayed network model as a benchmark. We introduce a conditional distributionally robust functional to quantify cascading effects between agents, utilizing a bi-variate normal distribution. Our approach yields closed-form risk expressions that reveal the impact of time delay, noise statistics, communication topology, and failure modes on rendezvous risk. The insights derived inform the design of resilient networks that mitigate the risk of cascading failures. We validate our theoretical results through extensive simulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: We study online combinatorial allocation problems in the secretary setting, under interdependent values. In the interdependent model, introduced by Milgrom and Weber (1982), each agent possesses a private signal that captures her information about an item for sale, and the value of every agent depends on the signals held by all agents. Mauras, Mohan, and Reiffenh\"auser (2024) were the first to study interdependent values in online settings, providing constant-approximation guarantees for secretary settings, where agents arrive online along with their signals and values, and the goal is to select the agent with the highest value.
  In this work, we extend this framework to {\em combinatorial} secretary problems, where agents have interdependent valuations over {\em bundles} of items, introducing additional challenges due to both combinatorial structure and interdependence. We provide $2e$-competitive algorithms for a broad class of valuation functions, including submodular and XOS functions, matching the approximation guarantees in the single-choice secretary setting. Furthermore, our results cover the same range of valuation classes for which constant-factor algorithms exist in classical (non-interdependent) secretary settings, while incurring only an additional factor of $2$ due to interdependence. Finally, we extend our study to strategic settings, and provide a $4e$-competitive truthful mechanism for online bipartite matching with interdependent valuations, again meeting the frontier of what is known, even without interdependence.

<title>DICE: Dynamic In-Context Example Selection in LLM Agents via Efficient Knowledge Transfer</title>

arXiv:2507.23554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL), have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks. However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance. Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient LLM agents.

<title>Semantic Chain-of-Trust: Autonomous Trust Orchestration for Collaborator Selection via Hypergraph-Aided Agentic AI</title>

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

Abstract: Today's algorithm-driven interfaces, from recommendation feeds to GenAI tools, often prioritize engagement and efficiency at the expense of user agency. As systems take on more decision-making, users have less control over what they see and how meaning or relationships between content are constructed. This paper introduces "Hypertextual Friction," a conceptual design stance that repositions classical hypertext principles--friction, traceability, and structure--as actionable values for reclaiming agency in algorithmically mediated environments. Through a comparative analysis of real-world interfaces--Wikipedia vs. Instagram Explore, and Are.na vs. GenAI image tools--we examine how different systems structure user experience, navigation, and authorship. We show that hypertext systems emphasize provenance, associative thinking, and user-driven meaning-making, while algorithmic systems tend to obscure process and flatten participation. We contribute: (1) a comparative analysis of how interface structures shape agency in user-driven versus agent-driven systems, and (2) a conceptual stance that offers hypertextual values as design commitments for reclaiming agency in an increasingly algorithmic web.

<title>Hierarchical Message-Passing Policies for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically, coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication (e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void, we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

<title>MemoCue: Empowering LLM-Based Agents for Human Memory Recall via Strategy-Guided Querying</title>

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges, we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in memory-recall applications.

Abstract: Agent-based simulations have an enormous potential as tools to evaluate social policies in a non-invasive way, before these are implemented to real-world populations. However, the recommendations that these computational approaches may offer to tackle urgent human development challenges can vary substantially depending on how we model agents' (people) behaviour and the criteria that we use to measure inequity. In this paper, we integrate the conceptual framework of the capability approach (CA), which is explicitly designed to promote and assess human well-being, to guide the simulation and evaluate the effectiveness of policies. We define a reinforcement learning environment where agents behave to restore their capabilities under the constraints of a specific policy. Working in collaboration with local stakeholders, non-profits and domain experts, we apply our model in a case study to mitigate health inequity among the population experiencing homelessness (PEH) in Barcelona. By doing so, we present the first proof of concept simulation, aligned with the CA for human development, to assess the impact of policies under parliamentary discussion.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive examination of agent-based approaches that codify the principles and linkages underlying multi-agent systems, simulations, and information systems. Based on two decades of study, this paper confirms a framework intended as a formal specification for geosimulation platforms. Our findings show that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively incorporated as agent components if they follow a structured architecture specific to fundamental agent activities such as perception, memory, planning, and action. This integration is precisely consistent with the architecture that we formalize, providing a solid platform for next-generation geosimulation systems.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in language modeling, its triumph hasn't yet fully translated to visuomotor agents. A primary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or environments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors across diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this challenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can achieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore RL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction capabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL representation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a unified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome the significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task synthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale multi-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework to support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction success rates by $4\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our findings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated environments, especially those amenable to large-scale task generation, for significantly advancing visuomotor agents' spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

Abstract: Achieving robust cognitive autonomy in robots navigating complex, unpredictable environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. This paper presents Underwater Robot Self-Organizing Autonomy (UROSA), a groundbreaking architecture leveraging distributed Large Language Model AI agents integrated within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework to enable advanced cognitive capabilities in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. UROSA decentralises cognition into specialised AI agents responsible for multimodal perception, adaptive reasoning, dynamic mission planning, and real-time decision-making. Central innovations include flexible agents dynamically adapting their roles, retrieval-augmented generation utilising vector databases for efficient knowledge management, reinforcement learning-driven behavioural optimisation, and autonomous on-the-fly ROS 2 node generation for runtime functional extensibility. Extensive empirical validation demonstrates UROSA's promising adaptability and reliability through realistic underwater missions in simulation and real-world deployments, showing significant advantages over traditional rule-based architectures in handling unforeseen scenarios, environmental uncertainties, and novel mission objectives. This work not only advances underwater autonomy but also establishes a scalable, safe, and versatile cognitive robotics framework capable of generalising to a diverse array of real-world applications.

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents. Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens, guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from 0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA, a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a research demo for public testing.

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents (CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training. Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures, not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other perception tasks.

Abstract: While many robotic tasks can be addressed using either centralized single-agent control with full state observation or decentralized multi-agent control, clear criteria for choosing between these approaches remain underexplored. This paper systematically investigates how multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with local observations can improve robustness in complex robotic systems compared to traditional centralized control. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that in certain tasks, decentralized MARL can achieve performance comparable to centralized methods while exhibiting greater resilience to perturbations and agent failures. By analytically demonstrating the equivalence of single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL) and MARL under full observability, we identify observability as the critical factor distinguishing the two paradigms. We further derive bounds quantifying performance degradation under external perturbations for locally observable policies. Empirical results on standard MARL benchmarks confirm that MARL with limited observations can maintain competitive performance. Finally, real-world experiments with a mobile manipulator demonstrate that decentralized MARL controllers achieve markedly improved robustness to agent malfunctions and environmental disturbances relative to centralized baselines. Together, these findings highlight MARL with local observations as a robust and practical alternative to conventional centralized control in complex robotic systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is ubiquitous in the development of modern AI systems. However, state-of-the-art RL agents require extensive, and potentially unsafe, interactions with their environments to learn effectively. These limitations confine RL agents to simulated environments, hindering their ability to learn directly in real-world settings. In this work, we present ActSafe, a novel model-based RL algorithm for safe and efficient exploration. ActSafe learns a well-calibrated probabilistic model of the system and plans optimistically w.r.t. the epistemic uncertainty about the unknown dynamics, while enforcing pessimism w.r.t. the safety constraints. Under regularity assumptions on the constraints and dynamics, we show that ActSafe guarantees safety during learning while also obtaining a near-optimal policy in finite time. In addition, we propose a practical variant of ActSafe that builds on latest model-based RL advancements and enables safe exploration even in high-dimensional settings such as visual control. We empirically show that ActSafe obtains state-of-the-art performance in difficult exploration tasks on standard safe deep RL benchmarks while ensuring safety during learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in aligning with diverse cultural values despite their remarkable performance in generation, which stems from inherent monocultural biases and difficulties in capturing nuanced cultural semantics. Existing methods struggle to adapt to unknown culture after fine-tuning. Inspired by cultural geography across five continents, we propose Cultural Palette, a multi-agent framework that redefines cultural alignment as an adaptive "color-blending" process for country-specific adaptation. Our approach harnesses cultural geography across five continents (Africa, America, Asia, Europe, Oceania) through three key steps: First, we synthesize the Pentachromatic Cultural Palette Dataset using GPT-4o, refining continental-level dialogues with Hofstede's cultural dimensions to establish foundational cultural representations. Second, five continent-level alignment agents form specialized cultural communities that generate region-specific draft responses. Third, a Meta Agent employs Cultural MoErges to dynamically blend these cultural "colors" through attention-gated parameter merging, akin to mixing pigments on a palette, resolving conflicts while preserving cultural nuances to produce the final culturally-aligned response. Extensive experiments across various countries demonstrate that Cultural Palette surpasses existing baselines in cultural alignment.

Abstract: Agents built on LLMs are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, automating complex decision-making and task execution. However, their autonomy introduces safety risks, including security vulnerabilities, legal violations, and unintended harmful actions. Existing mitigation methods, such as model-based safeguards and early enforcement strategies, fall short in robustness, interpretability, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSpec, a lightweight domain-specific language for specifying and enforcing runtime constraints on LLM agents. With AgentSpec, users define structured rules that incorporate triggers, predicates, and enforcement mechanisms, ensuring agents operate within predefined safety boundaries. We implement AgentSpec across multiple domains, including code execution, embodied agents, and autonomous driving, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that AgentSpec successfully prevents unsafe executions in over 90% of code agent cases, eliminates all hazardous actions in embodied agent tasks, and enforces 100% compliance by autonomous vehicles (AVs). Despite its strong safety guarantees, AgentSpec remains computationally lightweight, with overheads in milliseconds. By combining interpretability, modularity, and efficiency, AgentSpec provides a practical and scalable solution for enforcing LLM agent safety across diverse applications. We also automate the generation of rules using LLMs and assess their effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that the rules generated by OpenAI o1 achieve a precision of 95.56% and recall of 70.96% for embodied agents, successfully identify 87.26% of the risky code, and prevent AVs from breaking laws in 5 out of 8 scenarios.

Abstract: As the prediction horizon increases, predicting the future evolution of traffic scenes becomes increasingly difficult due to the multi-modal nature of agent motion. Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach. The code and model checkpoints are available at: https://github.com/continental/EP-Diffuser.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents can achieve super-human performance in complex decision-making tasks, but their behaviour is often difficult to understand and explain. This lack of explanation limits deployment, especially in safety-critical settings where understanding and trust are essential. We identify three core explanatory targets that together provide a comprehensive view of reinforcement learning agents: behaviour, outcomes, and predictions. We develop a unified theoretical framework for explaining these three elements of reinforcement learning agents through the influence of individual features that the agent observes in its environment. We derive feature influences by using Shapley values, which collectively and uniquely satisfy a set of well-motivated axioms for fair and consistent credit assignment. The proposed approach, Shapley Values for Explaining Reinforcement Learning (SVERL), provides a single theoretical framework to comprehensively and meaningfully explain reinforcement learning agents. It yields explanations with precise semantics that are not only interpretable but also mathematically justified, enabling us to identify and correct conceptual issues in prior explanations. Through illustrative examples, we show how SVERL produces useful, intuitive explanations of agent behaviour, outcomes, and predictions, which are not apparent from observing agent behaviour alone.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models are transforming AI, creating an imperative for the visualization field to embrace agentic frameworks. However, our field's focus on a human in the sensemaking loop raises critical questions about autonomy, delegation, and coordination for such \textit{agentic visualization} that preserve human agency while amplifying analytical capabilities. This paper addresses these questions by reinterpreting existing visualization systems with semi-automated or fully automatic AI components through an agentic lens. Based on this analysis, we extract a collection of design patterns for agentic visualization, including agentic roles, communication and coordination. These patterns provide a foundation for future agentic visualization systems that effectively harness AI agents while maintaining human insight and control.

<title>Where Paths Collide: A Comprehensive Survey of Classic and Learning-Based Multi-Agent Pathfinding</title>

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and robotics, requiring the computation of collision-free paths for multiple agents navigating from their start locations to designated goals. As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent in warehouses, urban transportation, and other complex environments, MAPF has evolved from a theoretical challenge to a critical enabler of real-world multi-robot coordination. This comprehensive survey bridges the long-standing divide between classical algorithmic approaches and emerging learning-based methods in MAPF research. We present a unified framework that encompasses search-based methods (including Conflict-Based Search, Priority-Based Search, and Large Neighborhood Search), compilation-based approaches (SAT, SMT, CSP, ASP, and MIP formulations), and data-driven techniques (reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and hybrid strategies). Through systematic analysis of experimental practices across 200+ papers, we uncover significant disparities in evaluation methodologies, with classical methods typically tested on larger-scale instances (up to 200 by 200 grids with 1000+ agents) compared to learning-based approaches (predominantly 10-100 agents). We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of evaluation metrics, environment types, and baseline selections, highlighting the need for standardized benchmarking protocols. Finally, we outline promising future directions including mixed-motive MAPF with game-theoretic considerations, language-grounded planning with large language models, and neural solver architectures that combine the rigor of classical methods with the flexibility of deep learning. This survey serves as both a comprehensive reference for researchers and a practical guide for deploying MAPF solutions in increasingly complex real-world applications.

<title>Identifying Super Spreaders in Multilayer Networks</title>

Abstract: Identifying super-spreaders can be framed as a subtask of the influence maximisation problem. It seeks to pinpoint agents within a network that, if selected as single diffusion seeds, disseminate information most effectively. Multilayer networks, a specific class of heterogeneous graphs, can capture diverse types of interactions (e.g., physical-virtual or professional-social), and thus offer a more accurate representation of complex relational structures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to identifying super-spreaders in such networks by leveraging graph neural networks. To this end, we construct a dataset by simulating information diffusion across hundreds of networks - to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind tailored specifically to multilayer networks. We further formulate the task as a variation of the ranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies each agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the duration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and (iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model, TopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom aggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data and adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our model against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning methods. The results, obtained across a broad spectrum of real-world and synthetic multilayer networks, demonstrate that TopSpreadersNetwork achieves superior performance in identifying high-impact nodes, while also offering improved interpretability through its structured output.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural language reasoning tasks, yet their reasoning processes remain brittle and difficult to interpret. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enhance reliability by eliciting intermediate reasoning steps or aggregating multiple outputs. However, they lack mechanisms for enforcing logical structure and assessing internal coherence. We introduce Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh), a novel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three parallel agents, each simulating a distinct mode of inference: abductive, deductive, and inductive. Each agent produces a reasoning trace, which is structured into a formal reasoning graph. To evaluate consistency, we apply Bayesian belief propagation guided by natural language inference (NLI), assigning confidence scores to each step. The most coherent graph is selected to derive the final answer. Experiments on symbolic (WebOfLies) and numerical (MultiArith) reasoning benchmarks show that ToTh consistently outperforms CoT, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding across multiple LLMs, while producing interpretable and logically grounded reasoning chains. Our findings suggest a promising direction for building more robust and cognitively inspired LLM reasoning. The implementation is available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/theorem-of-thought.

Abstract: Multi-hop claim verification is inherently challenging, requiring multi-step reasoning to construct verification chains while iteratively searching for information to uncover hidden bridging facts. This process is fundamentally interleaved, as effective reasoning relies on dynamically retrieved evidence, while effective search demands reasoning to refine queries based on partial information. To achieve this, we propose Hierarchical Agent Reasoning and Information Search (HARIS), explicitly modeling the coordinated process of reasoning-driven searching and search-informed reasoning. HARIS consists of a high-level reasoning agent that focuses on constructing the main verification chain, generating factual questions when more information is needed, and a low-level search agent that iteratively retrieves more information, refining its search based on intermediate findings. This design allows each agent to specialize in its respective task, enhancing verification accuracy and interpretability. HARIS is trained using reinforcement learning with outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on the EX-FEVER and HOVER benchmarks demonstrate that HARIS achieves strong performance, greatly advancing multi-hop claim verification.

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) for machine learning engineering (MLE) can automatically implement ML models via code generation. However, existing approaches to build such agents often rely heavily on inherent LLM knowledge and employ coarse exploration strategies that modify the entire code structure at once. This limits their ability to select effective task-specific models and perform deep exploration within specific components, such as experimenting extensively with feature engineering options. To overcome these, we propose MLE-STAR, a novel approach to build MLE agents. MLE-STAR first leverages external knowledge by using a search engine to retrieve effective models from the web, forming an initial solution, then iteratively refines it by exploring various strategies targeting specific ML components. This exploration is guided by ablation studies analyzing the impact of individual code blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel ensembling method using an effective strategy suggested by MLE-STAR. Our experimental results show that MLE-STAR achieves medals in 64% of the Kaggle competitions on the MLE-bench Lite, significantly outperforming the best alternative.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation (i.e., Code LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in AI-assisted software development and testing. However, recent studies have shown that these models are prone to generating vulnerable or even malicious code under adversarial settings. Existing red-teaming approaches rely on extensive human effort, limiting their scalability and practicality, and generally overlook the interactive nature of real-world AI-assisted programming, which often unfolds over multiple turns. To bridge these gaps, we present RedCoder, a red-teaming agent that engages victim models in multi-turn conversation to elicit vulnerable code. The pipeline to construct RedCoder begins with a multi-agent gaming process that simulates adversarial interactions, yielding a set of prototype conversations and an arsenal of reusable attack strategies. We then fine-tune an LLM on these prototype conversations to serve as the backbone of RedCoder. Once deployed, RedCoder autonomously engages Code LLMs in multi-turn conversations, dynamically retrieving relevant strategies from the arsenal to steer the dialogue toward vulnerability-inducing outputs. Experiments across multiple Code LLMs show that our approach outperforms prior single-turn and multi-turn red-team methods in inducing vulnerabilities in code generation, offering a scalable and effective tool for evaluating the security boundaries of modern code-generation systems.

arXiv:2507.22077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) proliferate in high-stakes domains -- from pharmaceuticals to legal workflows -- the challenge is no longer just intelligence, but verifiability. We introduce TrustTrack, a protocol that embeds structural guarantees -- verifiable identity, policy commitments, and tamper-resistant behavioral logs -- directly into agent infrastructure. This enables a new systems paradigm: trust-native autonomy. By treating compliance as a design constraint rather than post-hoc oversight, TrustTrack reframes how intelligent agents operate across organizations and jurisdictions. We present the protocol design, system requirements, and use cases in regulated domains such as pharmaceutical R&amp;D, legal automation, and AI-native collaboration. We argue that the Cloud -> AI -> Agent -> Trust transition represents the next architectural layer for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instruction-code pairs is essential for training Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation. Manually curated data is expensive and inherently limited in scale, motivating the development of code-centric synthesis methods. Yet, current approaches either focus on augmenting existing code or rely on predefined heuristics, both lacking rigorous data validation, which results in synthetic data that is ungrounded, repetitive, or overly simplistic. Inspired by collaborative programming practices, we propose CodeEvo, a framework that synthesizes code data through iterative interactions between two LLM agents: a Coder, which generates candidate code and test cases based on given instructions, and a Reviewer, which guides the synthesis process by producing new instructions and feedback. We further introduce a hybrid feedback mechanism that combines compiler determinism with the generative flexibility of agents, enabling automatic quality control throughout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on CodeEvo data significantly outperform established baselines across code generation benchmarks with various difficulties. In-depth analyses further provide insights from multiple perspectives into effective code-centric data synthesis.

<title>Toward Trusted Onboard AI: Advancing Small Satellite Operations using Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2507.22198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A RL (Reinforcement Learning) algorithm was developed for command automation onboard a 3U CubeSat. This effort focused on the implementation of macro control action RL, a technique in which an onboard agent is provided with compiled information based on live telemetry as its observation. The agent uses this information to produce high-level actions, such as adjusting attitude to solar pointing, which are then translated into control algorithms and executed through lower-level instructions. Once trust in the onboard agent is established, real-time environmental information can be leveraged for faster response times and reduced reliance on ground control. The approach not only focuses on developing an RL algorithm for a specific satellite but also sets a precedent for integrating trusted AI into onboard systems. This research builds on previous work in three areas: (1) RL algorithms for issuing high-level commands that are translated into low-level executable instructions; (2) the deployment of AI inference models interfaced with live operational systems, particularly onboard spacecraft; and (3) strategies for building trust in AI systems, especially for remote and autonomous applications. Existing RL research for satellite control is largely limited to simulation-based experiments; in this work, these techniques are tailored by constructing a digital twin of a specific spacecraft and training the RL agent to issue macro actions in this simulated environment. The policy of the trained agent is copied to an isolated environment, where it is fed compiled information about the satellite to make inference predictions, thereby demonstrating the RL algorithm's validity on orbit without granting it command authority. This process enables safe comparison of the algorithm's predictions against actual satellite behavior and ensures operation within expected parameters.

Abstract: Remote fetal monitoring technologies are becoming increasingly common. Yet, most current systems offer limited interpretability, leaving expectant parents with raw cardiotocography (CTG) data that is difficult to understand. In this work, we present CTG-Insight, a multi-agent LLM system that provides structured interpretations of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) signals. Drawing from established medical guidelines, CTG-Insight decomposes each CTG trace into five medically defined features: baseline, variability, accelerations, decelerations, and sinusoidal pattern, each analyzed by a dedicated agent. A final aggregation agent synthesizes the outputs to deliver a holistic classification of fetal health, accompanied by a natural language explanation. We evaluate CTG-Insight on the NeuroFetalNet Dataset and compare it against deep learning models and the single-agent LLM baseline. Results show that CTG-Insight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (96.4%) and F1-score (97.8%) while producing transparent and interpretable outputs. This work contributes an interpretable and extensible CTG analysis framework.

Abstract: The pursuit of general intelligence has traditionally centered on external objectives: an agent's control over its environments or mastery of specific tasks. This external focus, however, can produce specialized agents that lack adaptability. We propose representational empowerment, a new perspective towards a truly agent-centric learning paradigm by moving the locus of control inward. This objective measures an agent's ability to controllably maintain and diversify its own knowledge structures. We posit that the capacity -- to shape one's own understanding -- is an element for achieving better ``preparedness'' distinct from direct environmental influence. Focusing on internal representations as the main substrate for computing empowerment offers a new lens through which to design adaptable intelligent systems.

<title>Successor Features for Transfer in Alternating Markov Games</title>

arXiv:2507.22278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores successor features for knowledge transfer in zero-sum, complete-information, and turn-based games. Prior research in single-agent systems has shown that successor features can provide a ``jump start" for agents when facing new tasks with varying reward structures. However, knowledge transfer in games typically relies on value and equilibrium transfers, which heavily depends on the similarity between tasks. This reliance can lead to failures when the tasks differ significantly. To address this issue, this paper presents an application of successor features to games and presents a novel algorithm called Game Generalized Policy Improvement (GGPI), designed to address Markov games in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithm enables the transfer of learning values and policies across games. An upper bound of the errors for transfer is derived as a function the similarity of the task. Through experiments with a turn-based pursuer-evader game, we demonstrate that the GGPI algorithm can generate high-reward interactions and one-shot policy transfer. When further tested in a wider set of initial conditions, the GGPI algorithm achieves higher success rates with improved path efficiency compared to those of the baseline algorithms.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of autonomous systems, interaction among agents within a shared environment is both inevitable and essential for enhancing overall system capabilities. A key requirement in such multi-agent systems is the ability of each agent to reliably predict the future positions of its nearest neighbors. Traditionally, graphs and graph theory have served as effective tools for modeling inter agent communication and relationships. While this approach is widely used, the present work proposes a novel method that leverages dynamic graphs in a forward looking manner. Specifically, the employment of EvolveGCN, a dynamic graph convolutional network, to forecast the evolution of inter-agent relationships over time. To improve prediction accuracy and ensure physical plausibility, this research incorporates physics constrained loss functions based on the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations of motion. This integrated approach enhances the reliability of future state estimations in multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: Planning in modern LLM agents relies on the utilization of LLM as an internal world model, acquired during pretraining. However, existing agent designs fail to effectively assimilate new observations into dynamic updates of the world model. This reliance on the LLM's static internal world model is progressively prone to misalignment with the underlying true state of the world, leading to the generation of divergent and erroneous plans. We introduce a hierarchical agent architecture, CoEx, in which hierarchical state abstraction allows LLM planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx plans and interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic plans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously incorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the form of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and code-based symbolic memory. We evaluate our agent across a diverse set of agent scenarios involving rich environments and complex tasks including ALFWorld, PDDL, and Jericho. Our experiments show that CoEx outperforms existing agent paradigms in planning and exploration.

Abstract: Existing multi-agent path finding (MAPF) solvers do not account for uncertain behavior of uncontrollable agents. We present a novel variant of Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS), for both one-shot and lifelong MAPF in dynamic environments with uncontrollable agents. Our method consists of (1) training a learned predictor for the movement of uncontrollable agents, (2) quantifying the prediction error using conformal prediction (CP), a tool for statistical uncertainty quantification, and (3) integrating these uncertainty intervals into our modified ECBS solver. Our method can account for uncertain agent behavior, comes with statistical guarantees on collision-free paths for one-shot missions, and scales to lifelong missions with a receding horizon sequence of one-shot instances. We run our algorithm, CP-Solver, across warehouse and game maps, with competitive throughput and reduced collisions.

Abstract: Metaverse service is a product of the convergence between Metaverse and service systems, designed to address service-related challenges concerning digital avatars, digital twins, and digital natives within Metaverse. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), agents now play a pivotal role in Metaverse service ecosystem, serving dual functions: as digital avatars representing users in the virtual realm and as service assistants (or NPCs) providing personalized support. However, during the modeling of Metaverse service ecosystems, existing LLM-based agents face significant challenges in bridging virtual-world services with real-world services, particularly regarding issues such as character data fusion, character knowledge association, and ethical safety concerns. This paper proposes an explainable emotion alignment framework for LLM-based agents in Metaverse Service Ecosystem. It aims to integrate factual factors into the decision-making loop of LLM-based agents, systematically demonstrating how to achieve more relational fact alignment for these agents. Finally, a simulation experiment in the Offline-to-Offline food delivery scenario is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this framework, obtaining more realistic social emergence.

Abstract: We propose a scalable deep learning framework for parametrized sequential decision-making (ParaSDM), where multiple agents jointly optimize discrete action policies and shared continuous parameters. A key subclass of this setting arises in Facility-Location and Path Optimization (FLPO), where multi-agent systems must simultaneously determine optimal routes and facility locations, aiming to minimize the cumulative transportation cost within the network. FLPO problems are NP-hard due to their mixed discrete-continuous structure and highly non-convex objective. To address this, we integrate the Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) with a neural policy model called the Shortest Path Network (SPN)-a permutation-invariant encoder-decoder that approximates the MEP solution while enabling efficient gradient-based optimization over shared parameters. The SPN achieves up to 100$\times$ speedup in policy inference and gradient computation compared to MEP baselines, with an average optimality gap of approximately 6% across a wide range of problem sizes. Our FLPO approach yields over 10$\times$ lower cost than metaheuristic baselines while running significantly faster, and matches Gurobi's optimal cost with annealing at a 1500$\times$ speedup-establishing a new state of the art for ParaSDM problems. These results highlight the power of structured deep models for solving large-scale mixed-integer optimization tasks.

Abstract: We investigated the challenges of mitigating response delays in free-form conversations with virtual agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) within Virtual Reality (VR). For this, we used conversational fillers, such as gestures and verbal cues, to bridge delays between user input and system responses and evaluate their effectiveness across various latency levels and interaction scenarios. We found that latency above 4 seconds degrades quality of experience, while natural conversational fillers improve perceived response time, especially in high-delay conditions. Our findings provide insights for practitioners and researchers to optimize user engagement whenever conversational systems' responses are delayed by network limitations or slow hardware. We also contribute an open-source pipeline that streamlines deploying conversational agents in virtual environments.

Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly capable of autonomously completing complex, multi-step tasks using external tools. Yet, they still fall short of human-level performance in most domains including computer use, software development, and research. Their growing autonomy and ability to interact with the outside world, also introduces safety and security risks including potentially misaligned actions and adversarial manipulation. We argue that human-in-the-loop agentic systems offer a promising path forward, combining human oversight and control with AI efficiency to unlock productivity from imperfect systems. We introduce Magentic-UI, an open-source web interface for developing and studying human-agent interaction. Built on a flexible multi-agent architecture, Magentic-UI supports web browsing, code execution, and file manipulation, and can be extended with diverse tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP). Moreover, Magentic-UI presents six interaction mechanisms for enabling effective, low-cost human involvement: co-planning, co-tasking, multi-tasking, action guards, and long-term memory. We evaluate Magentic-UI across four dimensions: autonomous task completion on agentic benchmarks, simulated user testing of its interaction capabilities, qualitative studies with real users, and targeted safety assessments. Our findings highlight Magentic-UI's potential to advance safe and efficient human-agent collaboration.

Abstract: The advent of end-to-end autonomy stacks - often lacking interpretable intermediate modules - has placed an increased burden on ensuring that the final output, i.e., the motion plan, is safe in order to validate the safety of the entire stack. This requires a safety monitor that is both complete (able to detect all unsafe plans) and sound (does not flag safe plans). In this work, we propose a principled safety monitor that leverages modern multi-modal trajectory predictors to approximate forward reachable sets (FRS) of surrounding agents. By formulating a convex program, we efficiently extract these data-driven FRSs directly from the predicted state distributions, conditioned on scene context such as lane topology and agent history. To ensure completeness, we leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the FRS and guarantee coverage of ground-truth trajectories with high probability. To preserve soundness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or under predictor failure, we introduce a Bayesian filter that dynamically adjusts the FRS conservativeness based on the predictor's observed performance. We then assess the safety of the ego vehicle's motion plan by checking for intersections with these calibrated FRSs, ensuring the plan remains collision-free under plausible future behaviors of others. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show our approach significantly improves soundness while maintaining completeness, offering a practical and reliable safety monitor for learned autonomy stacks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents autonomously use external tools on top of one or more LLMs to accomplish specific tasks. Lately LLM agents for software engineering tasks have become popular. These agents can benefit from the use of program analysis tools working on program representations. This is demonstrated by existing agentic AI solutions such as AutoCodeRover or SpecRover which perform automated program repair. Specifically the goal of these works is to use program analysis to improve the patch quality. These agents are currently being used to automatically fix static analysis issues from the widely used SonarQube static analyzer.
  Nevertheless, for the agents to be deployed in a production environment, agents need to suggest software artifacts, such as patches, with evidence and with high confidence. In this work, we provide a workflow where an agent provides explanations of the bug in the form of symbolic formulae. The explanations are in the form of input conditions, infection conditions and output conditions, implemented as property based tests (PBT) and program-internal symbolic expressions. These can help in human developer cognition of the agent outputs as well as in achieving completely automated agentic workflows for software. The human developer can benefit from the input condition, represented as a PBT, to generate various concrete inputs showing a given issue. Furthermore, since the PBTs are executable, our explanations are executable as well. We can thus also use the explanations in a completely automated issue resolution environment for accepting or rejecting the patches that are suggested by patching agents such as AutoCodeRover. Finally, as agentic AI approaches continue to develop, the program analysis driven explanations can be provided to other LLM-based repair techniques such as Agentless to improve their output.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models offer promising capabilities to simulate complex human social interactions. We investigate whether LLM-based multi-agent simulations can reproduce core human social dynamics observed in online forums. We evaluate conformity dynamics, group polarization, and fragmentation across different model scales and reasoning capabilities using a structured simulation framework. Our findings indicate that smaller models exhibit higher conformity rates, whereas models optimized for reasoning are more resistant to social influence.

Abstract: The post-pandemic surge in healthcare demand, coupled with critical nursing shortages, has placed unprecedented pressure on emergency department triage systems, necessitating innovative AI-driven solutions. We present a multi-agent interactive intelligent system for medical triage that addresses three fundamental challenges in current AI-based triage systems: insufficient medical specialization leading to hallucination-induced misclassifications, heterogeneous department structures across healthcare institutions, and inefficient detail-oriented questioning that impedes rapid triage decisions. Our system employs three specialized agents - RecipientAgent, InquirerAgent, and DepartmentAgent - that collaborate through structured inquiry mechanisms and department-specific guidance rules to transform unstructured patient symptoms into accurate department recommendations. To ensure robust evaluation, we constructed a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset from a medical website, comprising 3,360 real-world cases spanning 9 primary departments and 62 secondary departments. Through systematic data imputation using large language models, we address the prevalent issue of incomplete medical records in real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-agent system achieves 89.2% accuracy in primary department classification and 73.9% accuracy in secondary department classification after four rounds of patient interaction. The system's pattern-matching-based guidance mechanisms enable efficient adaptation to diverse hospital configurations while maintaining high triage accuracy. Our work provides a scalable framework for deploying AI-assisted triage systems that can accommodate the organizational heterogeneity of healthcare institutions while ensuring clinically sound decision-making.

<title>Subtyping Breast Lesions via Generative Augmentation based Long-tailed Recognition in Ultrasound</title>

Abstract: Accurate identification of breast lesion subtypes can facilitate personalized treatment and interventions. Ultrasound (US), as a safe and accessible imaging modality, is extensively employed in breast abnormality screening and diagnosis. However, the incidence of different subtypes exhibits a skewed long-tailed distribution, posing significant challenges for automated recognition. Generative augmentation provides a promising solution to rectify data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose a dual-phase framework for long-tailed classification that mitigates distributional bias through high-fidelity data synthesis while avoiding overuse that corrupts holistic performance. The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning-driven adaptive sampler, dynamically calibrating synthetic-real data ratios by training a strategic multi-agent to compensate for scarcities of real data while ensuring stable discriminative capability. Furthermore, our class-controllable synthetic network integrates a sketch-grounded perception branch that harnesses anatomical priors to maintain distinctive class features while enabling annotation-free inference. Extensive experiments on an in-house long-tailed and a public imbalanced breast US datasets demonstrate that our method achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. More synthetic images can be found at https://github.com/Stinalalala/Breast-LT-GenAug.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to solve a wide range of practical tasks within multi-agent systems. However, existing human-designed multi-agent frameworks are typically limited to a small set of pre-defined scenarios, while current automated design methods suffer from several limitations, such as the lack of tool integration, dependence on external training data, and rigid communication structures. In this paper, we propose MetaAgent, a finite state machine based framework that can automatically generate a multi-agent system. Given a task description, MetaAgent will design a multi-agent system and polish it through an optimization algorithm. When the multi-agent system is deployed, the finite state machine will control the agent's actions and the state transitions. To evaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on both text-based tasks and practical tasks. The results indicate that the generated multi-agent system surpasses other auto-designed methods and can achieve a comparable performance with the human-designed multi-agent system, which is optimized for those specific tasks.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) offers a promising framework for developing control strategies in chemical process systems using historical data, without the risks or costs of online experimentation. This work investigates the application of offline RL to the safe and efficient control of an exothermic polymerisation continuous stirred-tank reactor. We introduce a Gymnasium-compatible simulation environment that captures the reactor's nonlinear dynamics, including reaction kinetics, energy balances, and operational constraints. The environment supports three industrially relevant scenarios: startup, grade change down, and grade change up. It also includes reproducible offline datasets generated from proportional-integral controllers with randomised tunings, providing a benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms in realistic process control tasks.
  We assess behaviour cloning and implicit Q-learning as baseline algorithms, highlighting the challenges offline agents face, including steady-state offsets and degraded performance near setpoints. To address these issues, we propose a novel deployment-time safety layer that performs gradient-based action correction using input convex neural networks (PICNNs) as learned cost models. The PICNN enables real-time, differentiable correction of policy actions by descending a convex, state-conditioned cost surface, without requiring retraining or environment interaction.
  Experimental results show that offline RL, particularly when combined with convex action correction, can outperform traditional control approaches and maintain stability across all scenarios. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating offline RL with interpretable and safety-aware corrections for high-stakes chemical process control, and lay the groundwork for more reliable data-driven automation in industrial systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the average consensus problem of multi-agent systems over wireless networks. We propose a distributed average consensus algorithm by invoking the concept of over-the-air aggregation, which exploits the signal superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels. The proposed algorithm deploys a modified version of the well-known Ratio Consensus algorithm with an additional normalization step for compensating for the arbitrary channel coefficients. We show that, when the noise level at the receivers is negligible, the algorithm converges asymptotically to the average for time-invariant and time-varying channels. Numerical simulations corroborate the validity of our results.

Abstract: Modern networked environments increasingly rely on spatial reasoning, but lack a coherent representation for coordinating physical space. Consequently, tasks such as enforcing spatial access policies remain fragile and manual. We first propose a unifying representation based on bigraphs, capturing spatial, social, and communication relationships within a single formalism, with user-facing tools to generate bigraphs from physical environments. Second, we present a hierarchical agent architecture for distributed spatial reasoning, with runtimes for agentic processes to interact the spatial representation, and a context-aware execution model that scopes reasoning to the smallest viable subspace. Together, these enable private, reliable, and low-latency spatial networking that can safely interact with agentic workflows.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of network infrastructure is bringing new challenges and opportunities for efficient network management, optimization, and security. With very large monitoring databases becoming expensive to explore, the use of AI and Generative AI can help reduce costs of managing these datasets. This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize network monitoring management by addressing the limitations of query finding and pattern analysis. We leverage LLMs to enhance anomaly detection, automate root-cause analysis, and automate incident analysis to build a well-monitored network management team using AI. Through a real-world example of developing our own OFCNetLLM, based on the open-source LLM model, we demonstrate practical applications of OFCnetLLM in the OFC conference network. Our model is developed as a multi-agent approach and is still evolving, and we present early results here.

Abstract: Recent advancements in financial problem-solving have leveraged LLMs and agent-based systems, with a primary focus on trading and financial modeling. However, credit assessment remains an underexplored challenge, traditionally dependent on rule-based methods and statistical models. In this paper, we introduce MASCA, an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to enhance credit evaluation by mirroring real-world decision-making processes. The framework employs a layered architecture where specialized LLM-based agents collaboratively tackle sub-tasks. Additionally, we integrate contrastive learning for risk and reward assessment to optimize decision-making. We further present a signaling game theory perspective on hierarchical multi-agent systems, offering theoretical insights into their structure and interactions. Our paper also includes a detailed bias analysis in credit assessment, addressing fairness concerns. Experimental results demonstrate that MASCA outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent systems in financial applications, particularly in credit scoring.

Abstract: This paper introduces Team-Attention-Actor-Critic (TAAC), a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to enhance multi-agent collaboration in cooperative environments. TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic. This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession swaps).

Abstract: Human mobility forms the backbone of contact patterns through which infectious diseases propagate, fundamentally shaping the spatio-temporal dynamics of epidemics and pandemics. While traditional models are often based on the assumption that all individuals have the same probability of infecting every other individual in the population, a so-called random homogeneous mixing, they struggle to capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of real-world human interactions. Recent advancements in data-driven methodologies and computational capabilities have unlocked the potential of integrating high-resolution human mobility data into epidemic modeling, significantly improving the accuracy, timeliness, and applicability of epidemic risk assessment, contact tracing, and intervention strategies. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current landscape in human mobility-informed epidemic modeling. We explore diverse sources and representations of human mobility data, and then examine the behavioral and structural roles of mobility and contact in shaping disease transmission dynamics. Furthermore, the review spans a wide range of epidemic modeling approaches, ranging from classical compartmental models to network-based, agent-based, and machine learning models. And we also discuss how mobility integration enhances risk management and response strategies during epidemics. By synthesizing these insights, the review can serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, bridging the gap between epidemiological theory and the dynamic complexities of human interaction while charting clear directions for future research.

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, due to the highly decoupled and flexible nature of microservices, it poses greater challenges to system reliability. The more frequent occurrence of incidents has created a demand for Root Cause Analysis(RCA) methods that enable rapid identification and recovery of incidents. Large language model (LLM) provides a new path for quickly locating and recovering from incidents by leveraging their powerful generalization ability combined with expert experience. Current LLM for RCA frameworks are based on ideas like ReAct and Chain-of-Thought, but the hallucination of LLM and the propagation nature of anomalies often lead to incorrect localization results. Moreover, the massive amount of anomalous information generated in large, complex systems presents a huge challenge for the context window length of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose KnowledgeMind, an innovative LLM multi-agent system based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and a knowledge base reward mechanism for standardized service-by-service reasoning. Compared to State-Of-The-Art(SOTA) LLM for RCA methods, our service-by-service exploration approach significantly reduces the burden on the maximum context window length, requiring only one-tenth of its size. Additionally, by incorporating a rule-based real-time reward mechanism, our method effectively mitigates hallucinations during the inference process. Compared to the SOTA LLM for RCA framework, our method achieves a 49.29% to 128.35% improvement in root cause localization accuracy.

arXiv:2507.22804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for performance-driven structural design that combines bottom-up design generation with learned strategies to efficiently search large combinatorial design spaces. Motivated by the limitations of conventional top-down approaches such as optimization, the framework instead models structures as compositions of predefined elements, aligning form finding with practical constraints like constructability and component reuse. With the formulation of the design task as a sequential decision-making problem and a human learning inspired training algorithm, the method adapts reinforcement learning for structural design. The framework is demonstrated by designing steel braced truss frame cantilever structures, where trained policies consistently generate distinct, high-performing designs that display structural performance and material efficiency with the use of structural strategies that align with known engineering principles. Further analysis shows that the agent efficiently narrows its search to promising regions of the design space, revealing transferable structural knowledge.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.22827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and democratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely solely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing spatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in practice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or mockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that performs UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding, planning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to detect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical layout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces HTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves robustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods. Furthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that automatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic examples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains in UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy, structural coherence, and code correctness. Our code is made publicly available at https://github.com/leigest519/ScreenCoder.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.22829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires complex reasoning, often approached through step-by-step natural language (NL) plans. However, NL plans are inherently ambiguous and lack structure, limiting their conversion into executable programs like SQL and hindering scalability, especially for multi-table tasks. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift to structured representations. We introduce a new structured plan, TaSoF, inspired by formalism in traditional multi-agent systems, and a framework, SPaGe, that formalizes the reasoning process in three phases: 1) Structured Planning to generate TaSoF from a query, 2) Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps into SQL and model dependencies via a directed cyclic graph for parallel execution, and 3) Summary Generation to produce query-focused summaries. Our method explicitly captures complex dependencies and improves reliability. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that SPaGe consistently outperforms prior models in both single- and multi-table settings, demonstrating the advantages of structured representations for robust and scalable summarization.

<title>RLVMR: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Meta-Reasoning Rewards for Robust Long-Horizon Agents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.22844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for complex, long-horizon tasks is a central goal in AI. However, dominant training paradigms face a critical limitation: reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize solely for final task success often reinforce flawed or inefficient reasoning paths, a problem we term inefficient exploration. This leads to agents that are brittle and fail to generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason coherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel framework that integrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding verifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors. RLVMR equips an agent to explicitly tag its cognitive steps, such as planning, exploration, and reflection, and provides programmatic, rule-based rewards for actions that contribute to effective problem-solving. These process-centric rewards are combined with the final outcome signal and optimized using a critic-free policy gradient method. On the challenging ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, RLVMR achieves new state-of-the-art results, with our 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on the most difficult unseen task split. Our analysis confirms these gains stem from improved reasoning quality, including significant reductions in redundant actions and enhanced error recovery, leading to more robust, efficient, and interpretable agents.

arXiv:2507.22849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel Decentralized Differentially Private Power Method (D-DP-PM) for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in networked multi-agent settings. Unlike conventional decentralized PCA approaches where each agent accesses the full n-dimensional sample space, we address the challenging scenario where each agent observes only a subset of dimensions through row-wise data partitioning. Our method ensures $(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy (DP) while enabling collaborative estimation of global eigenvectors across the network without requiring a central aggregator. We achieve this by having agents share only local embeddings of the current eigenvector iterate, leveraging both the inherent privacy from random initialization and carefully calibrated Gaussian noise additions. We prove that our algorithm satisfies the prescribed $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee and establish convergence rates that explicitly characterize the impact of the network topology. Our theoretical analysis, based on linear dynamics and high-dimensional probability theory, provides tight bounds on both privacy and utility. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that D-DP-PM achieves superior privacy-utility tradeoffs compared to naive local DP approaches, with particularly strong performance in moderate privacy regimes ($\epsilon\in[2, 5]$). The method converges rapidly, allowing practitioners to trade iterations for enhanced privacy while maintaining competitive utility.

<title>A Bit of Freedom Goes a Long Way: Classical and Quantum Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning under a Generative Model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.22854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time, freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by having access to a "simulator". By employing known classical and new quantum algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms from RL like "optimism in the face of uncertainty" and "posterior sampling" and instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al. (arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the $O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret, exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise all of our results to compact state spaces.

Abstract: Current artificial intelligence systems show near-human-level capabilities when deployed in isolation. Systems of a few collaborating intelligent agents are being engineered to perform tasks collectively. This raises the question of whether robotic matter, where many learning and intelligent agents interact, shows emergence of collective behaviour. And if so, which kind of phenomena would such systems exhibit? Here, we study a paradigmatic model for robotic matter: a stochastic many-particle system in which each particle is endowed with a deep neural network that predicts its transitions based on the particles' environments. For a one-dimensional model, we show that robotic matter exhibits complex emergent phenomena, including transitions between long-lived learning regimes, the emergence of particle species, and frustration. We also find a density-dependent phase transition with signatures of criticality. Using active matter theory, we show that this phase transition is a consequence of self-organisation mediated by emergent inter-particle interactions. Our simple model captures key features of more complex forms of robotic systems.

Abstract: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) in the presence of background noise remains a challenging problem in speech processing. Accurate VAD is essential in automatic speech recognition, voice-to-text, conversational agents, etc, where noise can severely degrade the performance. A modern application includes the voice assistant, specially mounted on Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) devices such as cell phones, smart glasses, earbuds, etc, where the voice signal includes background noise. Therefore, VAD modules must remain light-weight due to their practical on-device limitation. The existing models often struggle with low signal-to-noise ratios across diverse acoustic environments. A simple VAD often detects human voice in a clean environment, but struggles to detect the human voice in noisy conditions. We propose a noise-robust VAD that comprises a light-weight VAD, with data pre-processing and post-processing added modules to handle the background noise. This approach significantly enhances the VAD accuracy in noisy environments and requires neither a larger model, nor fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a notable improvement compared to baselines, particularly in environments with high background noise interference. This modified VAD additionally improving clean speech detection.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonconvex decentralised optimisation and learning over a network of distributed agents. We develop an ADMM algorithm based on the Randomised Block Coordinate Douglas-Rachford splitting method which enables agents in the network to distributedly and asynchronously compute a set of first-order stationary solutions of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decentralised and asynchronous algorithm for solving nonconvex optimisation problems with convergence proof. The numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for distributed Phase Retrieval and sparse Principal Component Analysis problems.

Abstract: People aptly exhibit general intelligence behaviors through flexible problem-solving and the ability to adapt to novel situations by reusing and applying high-level knowledge acquired over time. In contrast, artificial agents tend to be specialists, lacking such generalist behaviors. To bridge this gap, artificial agents will require understanding and exploiting critical structured knowledge representations. We introduce a metacognitive reasoning framework, Knowledge-Interaction-eXecution (KIX), and argue that interactions with objects, by leveraging a type space, facilitate the learning of transferable interaction concepts and promote generalization. This framework offers a principled approach for integrating knowledge into reinforcement learning and holds promise as an enabler for generalist behaviors in artificial intelligence, robotics, and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models have seen increasing use in various software development tasks, especially in code generation. The most advanced recent methods attempt to incorporate feedback from code execution into prompts to help guide LLMs in generating correct code in an iterative process. While effective, these methods could be costly due to numerous interactions with the LLM and extensive token usage. To address this issue, we propose an alternative approach named Evolutionary Prompt Engineering for Code (EPiC), which leverages a lightweight evolutionary algorithm to refine the original prompts into improved versions that generate high quality code, with minimal interactions with the LLM. Our evaluation against state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM based code generation agents shows that EPiC not only achieves up to 6% improvement in pass@k but is also 2-10 times more cost-effective than the baselines.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Model (LLM)-based programming agents often rely on test execution feedback to refine their generated code. These tests are synthetically generated by LLMs. However, LLMs may produce invalid or hallucinated test cases, which can mislead feedback loops and degrade the performance of agents in refining and improving code. This paper introduces VALTEST, a novel framework that leverages semantic entropy to automatically validate test cases generated by LLMs. Analyzing the semantic structure of test cases and computing entropy-based uncertainty measures, VALTEST trains a machine learning model to classify test cases as valid or invalid and filters out invalid test cases. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and various LLMs show that VALTEST not only boosts test validity by up to 29% but also improves code generation performance, as evidenced by significant increases in pass@1 scores. Our extensive experiments also reveal that semantic entropy is a reliable indicator to distinguish between valid and invalid test cases, which provides a robust solution for improving the correctness of LLM-generated test cases used in software testing and code generation.

Abstract: We explore the capability of evolution strategies to train an agent with a policy based on a transformer architecture in a reinforcement learning setting. We performed experiments using OpenAI's highly parallelizable evolution strategy to train Decision Transformer in the MuJoCo Humanoid locomotion environment and in the environment of Atari games, testing the ability of this black-box optimization technique to train even such relatively large and complicated models (compared to those previously tested in the literature). The examined evolution strategy proved to be, in general, capable of achieving strong results and managed to produce high-performing agents, showcasing evolution's ability to tackle the training of even such complex models.

Abstract: Computational disease modeling plays a crucial role in understanding and controlling the transmission of infectious diseases. While agent-based models (ABMs) provide detailed insights into individual dynamics, accurately replicating human motion remains challenging due to its complex, multi-factorial nature. Most existing frameworks fail to model realistic human motion, leading to oversimplified and less realistic behavior modeling. Furthermore, many current models rely on synthetic assumptions and fail to account for realistic environmental structures, transportation systems, and behavioral heterogeneity across occupation groups. To address these limitations, we introduce AVSim, an agent-based simulation framework designed to model airborne and vector-borne disease dynamics under realistic conditions. A distinguishing feature of AVSim is its ability to accurately model the dual nature of human mobility (both the destinations individuals visit and the duration of their stay) by utilizing GPS traces from real-world participants, characterized by occupation. This enables a significantly more granular and realistic representation of human movement compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, spectral clustering combined with graph-theoretic analysis is used to uncover latent behavioral patterns within occupations, enabling fine-grained modeling of agent behavior. We validate the synthetic human mobility patterns against ground-truth GPS data and demonstrate AVSim's capabilities via simulations of COVID-19 and dengue. The results highlight AVSim's capacity to trace infection pathways, identify high-risk zones, and evaluate interventions such as vaccination, quarantine, and vector control with occupational and geographic specificity.

Abstract: We present a challenging benchmark for the Open WorLd VISual question answering (OWLViz) task. OWLViz presents concise, unambiguous queries that require integrating multiple capabilities, including visual understanding, web exploration, and specialized tool usage. While humans achieve 69.2% accuracy on these intuitive tasks, even state-of-the-art VLMs struggle, with the best model, Gemini 2.0, achieving only 26.6% accuracy. Current agentic VLMs, which rely on limited vision and vision-language models as tools, perform even worse. This performance gap reveals significant limitations in multimodal systems' ability to select appropriate tools and execute complex reasoning sequences, establishing new directions for advancing practical AI research.

Abstract: Competitive Pok\'emon Singles (CPS) is a popular strategy game where players learn to exploit their opponent based on imperfect information in battles that can last more than one hundred stochastic turns. AI research in CPS has been led by heuristic tree search and online self-play, but the game may also create a platform to study adaptive policies trained offline on large datasets. We develop a pipeline to reconstruct the first-person perspective of an agent from logs saved from the third-person perspective of a spectator, thereby unlocking a dataset of real human battles spanning more than a decade that grows larger every day. This dataset enables a black-box approach where we train large sequence models to adapt to their opponent based solely on their input trajectory while selecting moves without explicit search of any kind. We study a progression from imitation learning to offline RL and offline fine-tuning on self-play data in the hardcore competitive setting of Pok\'emon's four oldest (and most partially observed) game generations. The resulting agents outperform a recent LLM Agent approach and a strong heuristic search engine. While playing anonymously in online battles against humans, our best agents climb to rankings inside the top 10% of active players. All agent checkpoints, training details, datasets, and baselines are available at https://metamon.tech.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models are accelerating the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents that utilize human-like vision perception capabilities to enhance productivity on digital devices. Compared to approaches predicated on GUI metadata, which are platform-dependent and vulnerable to implementation variations, vision-based approaches offer broader applicability. In this vision-based paradigm, the GUI instruction grounding, which maps user instruction to the location of corresponding element on the given screenshot, remains a critical challenge, particularly due to limited public training dataset and resource-intensive manual instruction data annotation. In this paper, we delve into unexplored challenges in this task including element-to-screen ratio, unbalanced element type, and implicit instruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale data synthesis pipeline UI-E2I-Synth for generating varying complex instruction datasets using GPT-4o instead of human annotators. Furthermore, we propose a new GUI instruction grounding benchmark UI-I2E-Bench, which is designed to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating diverse annotation aspects. Our model, trained on the synthesized data, achieves superior performance in GUI instruction grounding, demonstrating the advancements of proposed data synthesis pipeline. The proposed benchmark, accompanied by extensive analyses, provides practical insights for future research in GUI grounding. We will release corresponding artifacts at https://microsoft.github.io/FIVE-UI-Evol/ .

<title>The challenge of hidden gifts in multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>

Abstract: Sometimes we benefit from actions that others have taken even when we are unaware that they took those actions. For example, if your neighbor chooses not to take a parking spot in front of your house when you are not there, you can benefit, even without being aware that they took this action. These "hidden gifts" represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others are hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a very simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have individual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if all the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward. However, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective reward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they use it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents have dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a "hidden gift". We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including MARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this simple task. Interestingly, we find that independent model-free policy gradient agents can solve the task when we provide them with information about their own action history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action history. Finally, we derive a correction term for these independent agents, inspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning and helps them to converge to collective success more reliably. These results show that credit assignment in multi-agent settings can be particularly challenging in the presence of "hidden gifts", and demonstrate that learning awareness in independent agents can benefit these settings.

Abstract: Being able to solve a task in diverse ways makes agents more robust to task variations and less prone to local optima. In this context, constrained diversity optimization has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train a diverse set of agents in parallel. However, existing constrained-diversity RL methods often under-explore in complex tasks such as robotic manipulation, leading to a lack in policy diversity. To improve diversity optimization in RL, we therefore propose a curriculum that first explores at the trajectory level before learning step-based policies. In our empirical evaluation, we provide novel insights into the shortcoming of skill-based diversity optimization, and demonstrate empirically that our curriculum improves the diversity of the learned skills.

Abstract: Humans vary their expressivity when speaking for extended periods to maintain engagement with their listener. Although social robots tend to be deployed with ``expressive'' joyful voices, they lack this long-term variation found in human speech. Foundation model text-to-speech systems are beginning to mimic the expressivity in human speech, but they are difficult to deploy offline on robots. We present EmojiVoice, a free, customizable text-to-speech (TTS) toolkit that allows social roboticists to build temporally variable, expressive speech on social robots. We introduce emoji-prompting to allow fine-grained control of expressivity on a phase level and use the lightweight Matcha-TTS backbone to generate speech in real-time. We explore three case studies: (1) a scripted conversation with a robot assistant, (2) a storytelling robot, and (3) an autonomous speech-to-speech interactive agent. We found that using varied emoji prompting improved the perception and expressivity of speech over a long period in a storytelling task, but expressive voice was not preferred in the assistant use case.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly available at our project page https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/.

Abstract: While recent online HD mapping methods relieve burdened offline pipelines and solve map freshness, they remain limited by perceptual inaccuracies, occlusion in dense traffic, and an inability to fuse multi-agent observations. We propose RTMap to enhance these single-traversal methods by persistently crowdsourcing a multi-traversal HD map as a self-evolutional memory. On onboard agents, RTMap simultaneously addresses three core challenges in an end-to-end fashion: (1) Uncertainty-aware positional modeling for HD map elements, (2) probabilistic-aware localization w.r.t. the crowdsourced prior-map, and (3) real-time detection for possible road structural changes. Experiments on several public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our solid performance on both the prior-aided map quality and the localization accuracy, demonstrating our effectiveness of robustly serving downstream prediction and planning modules while gradually improving the accuracy and freshness of the crowdsourced prior-map asynchronously. Our source-code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RTMap.

Abstract: Embodied scene understanding requires not only comprehending visual-spatial information that has been observed but also determining where to explore next in the 3D physical world. Existing 3D Vision-Language (3D-VL) models primarily focus on grounding objects in static observations from 3D reconstruction, such as meshes and point clouds, but lack the ability to actively perceive and explore their environment. To address this limitation, we introduce \underline{\textbf{M}}ove \underline{\textbf{t}}o \underline{\textbf{U}}nderstand (\textbf{\model}), a unified framework that integrates active perception with \underline{\textbf{3D}} vision-language learning, enabling embodied agents to effectively explore and understand their environment. This is achieved by three key innovations: 1) Online query-based representation learning, enabling direct spatial memory construction from RGB-D frames, eliminating the need for explicit 3D reconstruction. 2) A unified objective for grounding and exploring, which represents unexplored locations as frontier queries and jointly optimizes object grounding and frontier selection. 3) End-to-end trajectory learning that combines \textbf{V}ision-\textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{E}xploration pre-training over a million diverse trajectories collected from both simulated and real-world RGB-D sequences. Extensive evaluations across various embodied navigation and question-answering benchmarks show that MTU3D outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and modular navigation approaches by 14\%, 23\%, 9\%, and 2\% in success rate on HM3D-OVON, GOAT-Bench, SG3D, and A-EQA, respectively. \model's versatility enables navigation using diverse input modalities, including categories, language descriptions, and reference images. These findings highlight the importance of bridging visual grounding and exploration for embodied intelligence.

Abstract: In the interconnected world, news media are critical in conveying information to public across diverse domains including technology, finance, and agriculture. Journalists make efforts to present accurate information, however, the interpretation of news often varies significantly among different audiences due to their specific expertise and age. In this work, we investigate how to identify these comprehension gaps and provide solutions to improve audiences understanding of news content, particular to the aspects of articles outside their primary domains of knowledge. We propose a agent-based framework using large language models (LLMs) to simulate society communication behaviors, where several agents can discuss news. These agents can be designed to be experts from various occupation, or from different age group. Our results indicate that this framework can identify confusions or even misunderstanding of news for the agent through the iterative discussion process. Based on these accurate identification, the framework can design a supplement material specific to these agents on the news. Our results show that agents exhibit significantly improved news understanding after receiving this material. These findings highlight our framework's utility and efficiency in enhancing news comprehension for diverse audiences by directly addressing their understanding gap.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals, limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering

Abstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang, together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of AI decision-making.

Current agents, however, are limited to following explicit human instructions, resulting in insufficient capability for proactive intent anticipation. Additionally, these agents fail to leverage the contextual information associated with users during task execution, thereby neglecting potentially vast differences in user preferences. To address these challenges, we introduce the FingerTip benchmark. It contains two new tracks: proactive task suggestions by analyzing environment observation and users' previous intents, and personalized task execution by catering to users' action preferences. We collected unique human demonstrations of multi-step Android device interactions across a variety of everyday apps. These demonstrations are not isolated but are continuously acquired from the users' long-term usage in their real lives, and encompass essential user-related contextual information. Our experiments reveal challenges of the tasks we propose. The model fine-tuned with the data we collected effectively utilized user information and achieved good results, highlighting the potential of our approach in building more user-oriented mobile GUI agents. Our code is open-source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FingerTip-57B8 for reproducibility.

Abstract: Biased data representation in AI marginalizes up to 75 million autistic people worldwide through medical applications viewing autism as a deficit of neurotypical social skills rather than an aspect of human diversity, and this perspective is grounded in research questioning the humanity of autistic people. Turing defined artificial intelligence as the ability to mimic human communication, and as AI development increasingly focuses on human-like agents, this benchmark remains popular. In contrast, we define Neuro-Inclusive AI as datasets and systems that move away from mimicking humanness as a benchmark for machine intelligence. Then, we explore the origins, prevalence, and impact of anti-autistic biases in current research. Our work finds that 90% of human-like AI agents exclude autistic perspectives, and AI creators continue to believe ethical considerations are beyond the scope of their work. To improve the autistic representation in data, we conduct empirical experiments with annotators and LLMs, finding that binary labeling schemes sufficiently capture the nuances of labeling anti-autistic hate speech. Our benchmark, AUTALIC, can be used to evaluate or fine-tune models, and was developed to serve as a foundation for more neuro-inclusive future work.

Abstract: Floridi and Taddeo propose a condition of "zero semantic commitment" for solutions to the grounding problem, and a solution to it. I argue briefly that their condition cannot be fulfilled, not even by their own solution. After a look at Luc Steels' very different competing suggestion, I suggest that we need to re-think what the problem is and what role the 'goals' in a system play in formulating the problem. On the basis of a proper understanding of computing, I come to the conclusion that the only sensible grounding problem is how we can explain and re-produce the behavioral ability and function of meaning in artificial computational agents

<title>The Value of Gen-AI Conversations: A bottom-up Framework for AI Value Alignment</title>

Abstract: Conversational agents (CAs) based on generative artificial intelligence frequently face challenges ensuring ethical interactions that align with human values. Current value alignment efforts largely rely on top-down approaches, such as technical guidelines or legal value principles. However, these methods tend to be disconnected from the specific contexts in which CAs operate, potentially leading to misalignment with users interests. To address this challenge, we propose a novel, bottom-up approach to value alignment, utilizing the value ontology of the ISO Value-Based Engineering standard for ethical IT design. We analyse 593 ethically sensitive system outputs identified from 16,908 conversational logs of a major European employment service CA to identify core values and instances of value misalignment within real-world interactions. The results revealed nine core values and 32 different value misalignments that negatively impacted users. Our findings provide actionable insights for CA providers seeking to address ethical challenges and achieve more context-sensitive value alignment.

Abstract: The rise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs), has greatly facilitated the resolution of complex tasks. However, current systems are still facing challenges of inter-agent communication, coordination, and interaction with heterogeneous tools and resources. Most recently, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol by Google have been introduced, and to the best of our knowledge, very few applications exist where both protocols are employed within a single MAS framework. We present a pilot study of AgentMaster, a novel modular multi-protocol MAS framework with self-implemented A2A and MCP, enabling dynamic coordination and flexible communication. Through a unified conversational interface, the system supports natural language interaction without prior technical expertise and responds to multimodal queries for tasks including information retrieval, question answering, and image analysis. Evaluation through the BERTScore F1 and LLM-as-a-Judge metric G-Eval averaged 96.3\% and 87.1\%, revealing robust inter-agent coordination, query decomposition, dynamic routing, and domain-specific, relevant responses. Overall, our proposed framework contributes to the potential capabilities of domain-specific, cooperative, and scalable conversational AI powered by MAS.

<title>Vulnerability Mitigation System (VMS): LLM Agent and Evaluation Framework for Autonomous Penetration Testing</title>

arXiv:2507.21113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the frequency of cyber threats increases, conventional penetration testing is failing to capture the entirety of todays complex environments. To solve this problem, we propose the Vulnerability Mitigation System (VMS), a novel agent based on a Large Language Model (LLM) capable of performing penetration testing without human intervention. The VMS has a two-part architecture for planning and a Summarizer, which enable it to generate commands and process feedback. To standardize testing, we designed two new Capture the Flag (CTF) benchmarks based on the PicoCTF and OverTheWire platforms with 200 challenges. These benchmarks allow us to evaluate how effectively the system functions. We performed a number of experiments using various LLMs while tuning the temperature and top-p parameters and found that GPT-4o performed best, sometimes even better than expected. The results indicate that LLMs can be effectively applied to many cybersecurity tasks; however, there are risks. To ensure safe operation, we used a containerized environment. Both the VMS and the benchmarks are publicly available, advancing the creation of secure, autonomous cybersecurity tools.

<title>VizGenie: Toward Self-Refining, Domain-Aware Workflows for Next-Generation Scientific Visualization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.21124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present VizGenie, a self-improving, agentic framework that advances scientific visualization through large language model (LLM) by orchestrating of a collection of domain-specific and dynamically generated modules. Users initially access core functionalities--such as threshold-based filtering, slice extraction, and statistical analysis--through pre-existing tools. For tasks beyond this baseline, VizGenie autonomously employs LLMs to generate new visualization scripts (e.g., VTK Python code), expanding its capabilities on-demand. Each generated script undergoes automated backend validation and is seamlessly integrated upon successful testing, continuously enhancing the system's adaptability and robustness. A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its intuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level feature-based queries (e.g., ``visualize the skull"). The system leverages image-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision models to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and technical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated visualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and reproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive provenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate significant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks. By integrating curated domain-specific tools with LLM-driven flexibility, VizGenie not only accelerates insight generation but also establishes a sustainable, continuously evolving visualization practice. The resulting platform dynamically learns from user interactions, consistently enhancing support for feature-centric exploration and reproducible research in scientific visualization.

<title>Privacy Artifact ConnecTor (PACT): Embedding Enterprise Artifacts for Compliance AI Agents</title>

Abstract: Enterprise environments contain a heterogeneous, rapidly growing collection of internal artifacts related to code, data, and many different tools. Critical information for assessing privacy risk and ensuring regulatory compliance is often embedded across these varied resources, each with their own arcane discovery and extraction techniques. Therefore, large-scale privacy compliance in adherence to governmental regulations requires systems to discern the interconnected nature of diverse artifacts in a common, shared universe.
  We present Privacy Artifact ConnecT or (PACT), an embeddings-driven graph that links millions of artifacts spanning multiple artifact types generated by a variety of teams and projects. Powered by the state-of-the-art DRAGON embedding model, PACT uses a contrastive learning objective with light fine-tuning to link artifacts via their textual components such as raw metadata, ownership specifics, and compliance context. Experimental results show that PACT's fine-tuned model improves recall@1 from 18% to 53%, the query match rate from 9.6% to 69.7% when paired with a baseline AI agent, and the hitrate@1 from 25.7% to 44.9% for candidate selection in a standard recommender system.

<title>Towards Unifying Quantitative Security Benchmarking for Multi Agent Systems</title>

arXiv:2507.21146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolving AI systems increasingly deploy multi-agent architectures where autonomous agents collaborate, share information, and delegate tasks through developing protocols. This connectivity, while powerful, introduces novel security risks. One such risk is a cascading risk: a breach in one agent can cascade through the system, compromising others by exploiting inter-agent trust. In tandem with OWASP's initiative for an Agentic AI Vulnerability Scoring System we define an attack vector, Agent Cascading Injection, analogous to Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius, operating across networks of agents. In an ACI attack, a malicious input or tool exploit injected at one agent leads to cascading compromises and amplified downstream effects across agents that trust its outputs. We formalize this attack with an adversarial goal equation and key variables (compromised agent, injected exploit, polluted observations, etc.), capturing how a localized vulnerability can escalate into system-wide failure. We then analyze ACI's properties -- propagation chains, amplification factors, and inter-agent compound effects -- and map these to OWASP's emerging Agentic AI risk categories (e.g. Impact Chain and Orchestration Exploits). Finally, we argue that ACI highlights a critical need for quantitative benchmarking frameworks to evaluate the security of agent-to-agent communication protocols. We outline a methodology for stress-testing multi-agent systems (using architectures such as Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP) against cascading trust failures, developing upon groundwork for measurable, standardized agent-to-agent security evaluation. Our work provides the necessary apparatus for engineers to benchmark system resilience, make data-driven architectural trade-offs, and develop robust defenses against a new generation of agentic threats.

<title>Large Language Model Powered Automated Modeling and Optimization of Active Distribution Network Dispatch Problems</title>

arXiv:2507.21162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative. However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval, optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively. Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent, greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and methods.

arXiv:2507.21196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce EdgeAgentX-DT, an advanced extension of the EdgeAgentX framework that integrates digital twin simulations and generative AI-driven scenario training to significantly enhance edge intelligence in military networks. EdgeAgentX-DT utilizes network digital twins, virtual replicas synchronized with real-world edge devices, to provide a secure, realistic environment for training and validation. Leveraging generative AI methods, such as diffusion models and transformers, the system creates diverse and adversarial scenarios for robust simulation-based agent training. Our multi-layer architecture includes: (1) on-device edge intelligence; (2) digital twin synchronization; and (3) generative scenario training. Experimental simulations demonstrate notable improvements over EdgeAgentX, including faster learning convergence, higher network throughput, reduced latency, and improved resilience against jamming and node failures. A case study involving a complex tactical scenario with simultaneous jamming attacks, agent failures, and increased network loads illustrates how EdgeAgentX-DT sustains operational performance, whereas baseline methods fail. These results highlight the potential of digital-twin-enabled generative training to strengthen edge AI deployments in contested environments.

Abstract: The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions: intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications, societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously updated collection of relevant studies for agentic web is available at: https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/agentic-web.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to simulate social interactions, but most of the frameworks miss the underlying cognitive complexity of human behavior. In this paper, we introduce Trans-ACT (Transactional Analysis Cognitive Toolkit), an approach embedding Transactional Analysis (TA) principles into MAS to generate agents with realistic psychological dynamics. Trans-ACT integrates the Parent, Adult, and Child ego states into an agent's cognitive architecture. Each ego state retrieves context-specific memories and uses them to shape response to new situations. The final answer is chosen according to the underlying life script of the agent. Our experimental simulation, which reproduces the Stupid game scenario, demonstrates that agents grounded in cognitive and TA principles produce deeper and context-aware interactions. Looking ahead, our research opens a new way for a variety of applications, including conflict resolution, educational support, and advanced social psychology studies.

Abstract: Wearable AI systems aim to provide timely assistance in daily life, but existing approaches often rely on user initiation or predefined task knowledge, neglecting users' current mental states. We introduce ProMemAssist, a smart glasses system that models a user's working memory (WM) in real-time using multi-modal sensor signals. Grounded in cognitive theories of WM, our system represents perceived information as memory items and episodes with encoding mechanisms, such as displacement and interference. This WM model informs a timing predictor that balances the value of assistance with the cost of interruption. In a user study with 12 participants completing cognitively demanding tasks, ProMemAssist delivered more selective assistance and received higher engagement compared to an LLM baseline system. Qualitative feedback highlights the benefits of WM modeling for nuanced, context-sensitive support, offering design implications for more attentive and user-aware proactive agents.

<title>MAAD: Automate Software Architecture Design through Knowledge-Driven Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>

arXiv:2507.21382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software architecture design is a critical, yet inherently complex and knowledge-intensive phase of software development. It requires deep domain expertise, development experience, architectural knowledge, careful trade-offs among competing quality attributes, and the ability to adapt to evolving requirements. Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and relies heavily on architects, often resulting in limited design alternatives, especially under the pressures of agile development. While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promising performance across various SE tasks, their application to architecture design remains relatively scarce and requires more exploration, particularly in light of diverse domain knowledge and complex decision-making. To address the challenges, we proposed MAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design), an automated framework that employs a knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS) for architecture design. MAAD orchestrates four specialized agents (i.e., Analyst, Modeler, Designer and Evaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements specifications and produce architectural blueprints enriched with quality attributes-based evaluation reports. We then evaluated MAAD through a case study and comparative experiments against MetaGPT, a state-of-the-art MAS baseline. Our results show that MAAD's superiority lies in generating comprehensive architectural components and delivering insightful and structured architecture evaluation reports. Feedback from industrial architects across 11 requirements specifications further reinforces MAAD's practical usability. We finally explored the performance of the MAAD framework with three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Llama 3.3) and found that GPT-4o exhibits better performance in producing architecture design, emphasizing the importance of LLM selection in MAS-driven architecture design.

<title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Cell DTX/DRX Configuration for Network Energy Saving</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.21385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3GPP Release 18 cell discontinuous transmission and reception (cell DTX/DRX) is an important new network energy saving feature for 5G. As a time-domain technique, it periodically aggregates the user data transmissions in a given duration of time when the traffic load is not heavy, so that the remaining time can be kept silent and advanced sleep modes (ASM) can be enabled to shut down more radio components and save more energy for the cell. However, inevitably the packet delay is increased, as during the silent period no transmission is allowed. In this paper we study how to configure cell DTX/DRX to optimally balance energy saving and packet delay, so that for delay-sensitive traffic maximum energy saving can be achieved while the degradation of quality of service (QoS) is minimized. As the optimal configuration can be different for different network and traffic conditions, the problem is complex and we resort to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train an AI agent to solve it. Through careful design of 1) the learning algorithm, which implements a deep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit (CB) model, and 2) the reward function, which utilizes a smooth approximation of a theoretically optimal but discontinuous reward function, we are able to train an AI agent that always tries to select the best possible Cell DTX/DRX configuration under any network and traffic conditions. Simulation results show that compared to the case when cell DTX/DRX is not used, our agent can achieve up to ~45% energy saving depending on the traffic load scenario, while always maintaining no more than ~1% QoS degradation.

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS. Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent systems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated, independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1) Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode, combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100 consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average), while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%). Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model capabilities.

Abstract: This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task. We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory. LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy, achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of 0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems, including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading, while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning, this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and broadening access through local deployment.

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

<title>An LLM Driven Agent Framework for Automated Infrared Spectral Multi Task Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning, offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate, automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base, automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.

Abstract: Any agents we can possibly build are subject to capacity constraints, as memory and compute resources are inherently finite. However, comparatively little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.

Abstract: The rise of LLM-based agents has opened new frontiers in AI applications, yet evaluating these agents remains a complex and underdeveloped area. This survey provides an in-depth overview of the emerging field of LLM agent evaluation, introducing a two-dimensional taxonomy that organizes existing work along (1) evaluation objectives -- what to evaluate, such as agent behavior, capabilities, reliability, and safety -- and (2) evaluation process -- how to evaluate, including interaction modes, datasets and benchmarks, metric computation methods, and tooling. In addition to taxonomy, we highlight enterprise-specific challenges, such as role-based access to data, the need for reliability guarantees, dynamic and long-horizon interactions, and compliance, which are often overlooked in current research. We also identify future research directions, including holistic, more realistic, and scalable evaluation. This work aims to bring clarity to the fragmented landscape of agent evaluation and provide a framework for systematic assessment, enabling researchers and practitioners to evaluate LLM agents for real-world deployment.

<title>LITE: A Learning-Integrated Topological Explorer for Multi-Floor Indoor Environments</title>

Abstract: This work focuses on multi-floor indoor exploration, which remains an open area of research. Compared to traditional methods, recent learning-based explorers have demonstrated significant potential due to their robust environmental learning and modeling capabilities, but most are restricted to 2D environments. In this paper, we proposed a learning-integrated topological explorer, LITE, for multi-floor indoor environments. LITE decomposes the environment into a floor-stair topology, enabling seamless integration of learning or non-learning-based 2D exploration methods for 3D exploration. As we incrementally build floor-stair topology in exploration using YOLO11-based instance segmentation model, the agent can transition between floors through a finite state machine. Additionally, we implement an attention-based 2D exploration policy that utilizes an attention mechanism to capture spatial dependencies between different regions, thereby determining the next global goal for more efficient exploration. Extensive comparison and ablation studies conducted on the HM3D and MP3D datasets demonstrate that our proposed 2D exploration policy significantly outperforms all baseline explorers in terms of exploration efficiency. Furthermore, experiments in several 3D multi-floor environments indicate that our framework is compatible with various 2D exploration methods, facilitating effective multi-floor indoor exploration. Finally, we validate our method in the real world with a quadruped robot, highlighting its strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial intelligence, offering unprecedented capabilities in reasoning, generalization, and zero-shot learning. These strengths open new frontiers in wireless communications, where increasing complexity and dynamics demand intelligent and adaptive solutions. This article explores the role of LLMs in transforming wireless systems across three key directions: adapting pretrained LLMs for core communication tasks, developing wireless-specific foundation models to balance versatility and efficiency, and enabling agentic LLMs with autonomous reasoning and coordination capabilities. We highlight recent advances, practical case studies, and the unique benefits of LLM-based approaches over traditional methods. Finally, we outline open challenges and research opportunities, including multimodal fusion, collaboration with lightweight models, and self-improving capabilities, charting a path toward intelligent, adaptive, and autonomous wireless networks of the future.

Abstract: Human demonstration data is often ambiguous and incomplete, motivating imitation learning approaches that also exhibit reliable planning behavior. A common paradigm to perform planning-from-demonstration involves learning a reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) then deploying this reward via Model Predictive Control (MPC). Towards unifying these methods, we derive a replacement of the policy in IRL with a planning-based agent. With connections to Adversarial Imitation Learning, this formulation enables end-to-end interactive learning of planners from observation-only demonstrations. In addition to benefits in interpretability, complexity, and safety, we study and observe significant improvements on sample efficiency, out-of-distribution generalization, and robustness. The study includes evaluations in both simulated control benchmarks and real-world navigation experiments using few-to-single observation-only demonstrations.

Abstract: The need for explanations in AI has, by and large, been driven by the desire to increase the transparency of black-box machine learning models. However, such explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a specific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a human-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on individuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the explanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to explanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based on what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's worldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous interactions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can estimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user.

<title>Exploring the Link Between Bayesian Inference and Embodied Intelligence: Toward Open Physical-World Embodied AI Systems</title>

Abstract: Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open physical-world embodied intelligence.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a key enabler for extending perception range and enhancing driving safety by providing visibility beyond the line of sight. However, integrating multi-source sensor data from both ego-vehicles and infrastructure under real-world constraints, such as limited communication bandwidth and dynamic environments, presents significant technical challenges. To facilitate research in this area, we organized the End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge, which features two tracks: cooperative temporal perception and cooperative end-to-end planning. Built on the UniV2X framework and the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset, the challenge attracted participation from over 30 teams worldwide and established a unified benchmark for evaluating cooperative driving systems. This paper describes the design and outcomes of the challenge, highlights key research problems including bandwidth-aware fusion, robust multi-agent planning, and heterogeneous sensor integration, and analyzes emerging technical trends among top-performing solutions. By addressing practical constraints in communication and data fusion, the challenge contributes to the development of scalable and reliable V2X-cooperative autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the notion of legibility in sequential decision-making in the context of teams and teamwork. There have been works that extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for deterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one agent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible decision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In this work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent settings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We showcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our proposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with a legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with standard optimal behaviour.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents integrate pre-trained LLMs with modular algorithmic components and have shown remarkable reasoning and decision-making abilities. In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop, ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric solution for automated personnel management.

Abstract: The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\times$ faster when vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for assistive robotics. The code is available at: https://github.com/assistive-autonomy/assistax.

arXiv:2507.21667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a deep neural network (DNN)-based neuro-adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) strategy for leader-follower tracking in multi-agent systems with higher-order, heterogeneous, nonlinear, and unknown dynamics under external disturbances. The DNN is used to compensate the unknown nonlinear dynamics with higher accuracy than shallow neural networks (NNs) and SMC ensures robust tracking. This framework employs restricted potential functions within a set-theoretic paradigm to ensure system trajectories remain bounded within a compact set, improving robustness against approximation errors and external disturbances. The control scheme is grounded in non-smooth Lyapunov stability theory, with update laws derived for both inner and outer layer network weights of DNN. A numerical example is simulated that showcases the proposed controller's effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness.

Abstract: As large language models demonstrate enormous potential in the field of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), generative AI-assisted chip design is attracting widespread attention from academia and industry. Although these technologies have made preliminary progress in tasks such as code generation, their application in chip verification -- a critical bottleneck in the chip development cycle -- remains at an exploratory stage. This paper proposes an innovative Multi-Agent Verification Framework (MAVF) aimed at addressing the limitations of current single-LLM approaches in complex verification tasks. Our framework builds an automated transformation system from design specifications to testbench through the collaborative work of multiple specialized agents, including specification parsing, verification strategy generation, and code implementation. Through verification experiments on multiple chip modules of varying complexity, results show that MAVF significantly outperforms traditional manual methods and single-dialogue generative AI approaches in verification document parsing and generation, as well as automated testbench generation. This research opens new directions for exploring generative AI applications in verification automation, potentially providing effective approaches to solving the most challenging bottleneck issues in chip design.

Abstract: This study uses agent-based modeling to examine the impact of various recommendation algorithms on the propagation of misinformation on online social networks. We simulate a synthetic environment consisting of heterogeneous agents, including regular users, bots, and influencers, interacting through a social network with recommendation systems. We evaluate four recommendation strategies: popularity-based, collaborative filtering, and content-based filtering, along with a random baseline. Our results show that popularity-driven algorithms significantly amplify misinformation, while item-based collaborative filtering and content-based approaches are more effective in limiting exposure to fake content. Item-based collaborative filtering was found to perform better than previously reported in related literature. These findings highlight the role of algorithm design in shaping online information exposure and show that agent-based modeling can be used to gain realistic insight into how misinformation spreads.

arXiv:2507.21772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reliable communication network is essential for multiple UAVs operating within obstacle-cluttered environments, where limited communication due to obstructions often occurs. A common solution is to deploy intermediate UAVs to relay information via a multi-hop network, which introduces two challenges: (i) how to design the structure of multihop networks; and (ii) how to maintain connectivity during collaborative motion. To this end, this work first proposes an efficient constrained search method based on the minimumedge RRT? algorithm, to find a spanning-tree topology that requires a less number of UAVs for the deployment task. Then, to achieve this deployment, a distributed model predictive control strategy is proposed for the online motion coordination. It explicitly incorporates not only the inter-UAV and UAVobstacle distance constraints, but also the line-of-sight (LOS) connectivity constraint. These constraints are well-known to be nonlinear and often tackled by various approximations. In contrast, this work provides a theoretical guarantee that all agent trajectories are ensured to be collision-free with a teamwise LOS connectivity at all time. Numerous simulations are performed in 3D valley-like environments, while hardware experiments validate its dynamic adaptation when the deployment position changes online.

Abstract: Commitments play a crucial role in game theory, shaping strategic interactions by either altering a player's own payoffs or influencing the incentives of others through outcome-contingent payments. While most research has focused on using commitments to achieve efficient equilibria, their potential applications beyond this goal remain largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce a non-coercive extortion mechanism that leverages commitments to outcome-contingent payments, demonstrating how a player or external agent can extract profit by offering rewards rather than threatening punishment. At the core of the mechanism is the introduction of sequentiality into a simultaneous-move game, fundamentally reshaping the strategic interaction. We derive the conditions under which extortion is successful, identify the class of games susceptible to this scheme, and determine both the maximum extractable profit and the minimum required payment. To illustrate the extortion mechanism, we apply it to 2x2 games, highlighting how even simple strategic settings can be vulnerable to this form of manipulation. Our results reveal strategic vulnerabilities in competitive settings, with significant implications for economic markets, diplomatic relations, and multi-agent systems operating in blockchain environments. This work broadens our understanding of commitments in game theory and raises critical questions about how to safeguard strategic interactions from exploitation through non-coercive extortion.

<title>Out of Distribution, Out of Luck: How Well Can LLMs Trained on Vulnerability Datasets Detect Top 25 CWE Weaknesses?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21817</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.21817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated vulnerability detection research has made substantial progress, yet its real-world impact remains limited. Current vulnerability datasets suffer from issues including label inaccuracy rates of 20-71%, extensive duplication, and poor coverage of critical CWE types. These issues create a significant "generalization gap" where models achieve misleading self-testing performance (measured on held-out data from same dataset for training) by exploiting spurious correlations rather than learning true vulnerability patterns. Our analysis reveals that many models experience substantial performance drops of up to 40.6% when evaluated on independent data, sometimes underperforming random guessing.
  To address these limitations, we present a three-part solution. First, we introduce a manually curated test dataset, BenchVul, covering the MITRE Top 25 Most Dangerous CWEs. Second, we construct a high-quality training dataset, TitanVul, comprising 35,045 functions by aggregating seven public sources and applying deduplication and validation using a novel multi-agent LLM framework. Third, we propose a Realistic Vulnerability Generation (RVG) framework, which synthesizes context-aware vulnerability examples for underrepresented but critical CWE types through simulated development workflows.
  Our evaluation shows the strengths of each component in closing the generalization gap. First, BenchVul shows the limitations of self-testing: models trained on existing datasets, such as BigVul and PrimeVul, experience performance drops on BenchVul (from 0.776 to 0.519 and from 0.567 to 0.337). Second, training models on TitanVul demonstrates improved generalization, with model performance increasing from 0.584 when evaluated on the same dataset to 0.767 when tested on BenchVul. Third, supplementing TitanVul with RVG-generated data yields further gains, increasing model performance by 14.0% to 0.874.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence agents represent the next major revolution in the continuous technological evolution of industrial automation. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for business process design and development that leverages the capabilities of Agentic AI. Departing from the traditional task-based approach to business process design, we propose an agent-based method, where agents contribute to the achievement of business goals, identified by a set of business objects. When a single agent cannot fulfill a goal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of multiple agents. The proposed model leads to a more modular and intelligent business process development by organizing it around goals, objects, and agents. As a result, this approach enables flexible and context-aware automation in dynamic industrial environments.

Abstract: In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding the beliefs and intentions of other agents. While prior work on goal recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain, we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, but relies on chunk-based retrieval that lacks structural semantics. GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost, fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.

Abstract: Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic, contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1 improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/cilabuniba/artseek.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models. However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm; 3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR) format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8% on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/VIS-MPU-Agent/MMAT-1M.

Abstract: This paper develops a game-theoretic decision-making framework for autonomous driving in multi-agent scenarios. A novel hierarchical game-based decision framework is developed for the ego vehicle. This framework features an interaction graph, which characterizes the interaction relationships between the ego and its surrounding traffic agents (including AVs, human driven vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles, and others), and enables the ego to smartly select a limited number of agents as its game players. Compared to the standard multi-player games, where all surrounding agents are considered as game players, the hierarchical game significantly reduces the computational complexity. In addition, compared to pairwise games, the most popular approach in the literature, the hierarchical game promises more efficient decisions for the ego (in terms of less unnecessary waiting and yielding). To further reduce the computational cost, we then propose an improved hierarchical game, which decomposes the hierarchical game into a set of sub-games. Decision safety and efficiency are analyzed in both hierarchical games. Comprehensive simulation studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks, with an intersection-crossing scenario as a case study.

<title>MapAgent: Trajectory-Constructed Memory-Augmented Planning for Mobile Task Automation</title>

Abstract: The recent advancement of autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated significant potential for automating tasks on mobile devices through graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite initial progress, these agents still face challenges when handling complex real-world tasks. These challenges arise from a lack of knowledge about real-life mobile applications in LLM-based agents, which may lead to ineffective task planning and even cause hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based agent framework called MapAgent that leverages memory constructed from historical trajectories to augment current task planning. Specifically, we first propose a trajectory-based memory mechanism that transforms task execution trajectories into a reusable and structured page-memory database. Each page within a trajectory is extracted as a compact yet comprehensive snapshot, capturing both its UI layout and functional context. Secondly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine task planning approach that retrieves relevant pages from the memory database based on similarity and injects them into the LLM planner to compensate for potential deficiencies in understanding real-world app scenarios, thereby achieving more informed and context-aware task planning. Finally, planned tasks are transformed into executable actions through a task executor supported by a dual-LLM architecture, ensuring effective tracking of task progress. Experimental results in real-world scenarios demonstrate that MapAgent achieves superior performance to existing methods. The code will be open-sourced to support further research.

Abstract: Recently, the field of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has gained popularity as researchers are trying to develop artificial intelligence capable of efficient collective reasoning. Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in isolated tasks, yet struggle with higher-order cognition required for adaptive collaboration. Human teams achieve synergy not only through knowledge sharing, but also through recursive reasoning, structured critique, and the ability to infer others' mental states. Current artificial systems lack these essential mechanisms, limiting their ability to engage in sophisticated collective reasoning. This work explores cognitive processes that enable effective collaboration, focusing on adaptive theory of mind (ToM) and systematic critical evaluation. We investigate three key questions. First, how does the ability to model others' perspectives enhance coordination and reduce redundant reasoning? Second, to what extent does structured critique improve reasoning quality by identifying logical gaps and mitigating biases? Third, the interplay of these mechanisms can lead to emergent cognitive synergy, where the collective intelligence of the system exceeds the sum of its parts. Through an empirical case study on complex decision making, we show that the integration of these cognitive mechanisms leads to more coherent, adaptive, and rigorous agent interactions. This article contributes to the field of cognitive science and AI research by presenting a structured framework that emulates human-like collaborative reasoning MAS. It highlights the significance of dynamic ToM and critical evaluation in advancing multi-agent systems' ability to tackle complex, real-world challenges.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities. Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training, we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process: 1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a "Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy; and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

<title>From Seeing to Experiencing: Scaling Navigation Foundation Models with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy, which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale foundation models in Robotics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague, evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally, requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only 20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

<title>Validating Generative Agent-Based Models of Social Norm Enforcement: From Replication to Novel Predictions</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, there is growing interest in using them to simulate human social behavior through generative agent-based modeling (GABM). However, validating these models remains a key challenge. We present a systematic two-stage validation approach using social dilemma paradigms from psychological literature, first identifying the cognitive components necessary for LLM agents to reproduce known human behaviors in mixed-motive settings from two landmark papers, then using the validated architecture to simulate novel conditions. Our model comparison of different cognitive architectures shows that both persona-based individual differences and theory of mind capabilities are essential for replicating third-party punishment (TPP) as a costly signal of trustworthiness. For the second study on public goods games, this architecture is able to replicate an increase in cooperation from the spread of reputational information through gossip. However, an additional strategic component is necessary to replicate the additional boost in cooperation rates in the condition that allows both ostracism and gossip. We then test novel predictions for each paper with our validated generative agents. We find that TPP rates significantly drop in settings where punishment is anonymous, yet a substantial amount of TPP persists, suggesting that both reputational and intrinsic moral motivations play a role in this behavior. For the second paper, we introduce a novel intervention and see that open discussion periods before rounds of the public goods game further increase contributions, allowing groups to develop social norms for cooperation. This work provides a framework for validating generative agent models while demonstrating their potential to generate novel and testable insights into human social behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity, transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability over conventional RAG approaches.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior and evolution of a dynamical many-body system by analyzing patterns in their experimentally captured images is a promising method relevant for a variety of living and non-living self-assembled systems. The arrays of moving liquid crystal skyrmions studied here are a representative example of hierarchically organized materials that exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics driven by multiscale processes. Joint geometric and topological data analysis (TDA) offers a powerful framework for investigating such systems by capturing the underlying structure of the data at multiple scales. In the TDA approach, we introduce the $\Psi$-function, a robust numerical topological descriptor related to both the spatiotemporal changes in the size and shape of individual topological solitons and the emergence of regions with their different spatial organization. The geometric method based on the analysis of vector fields generated from images of skyrmion ensembles offers insights into the nonlinear physical mechanisms of the system's response to external stimuli and provides a basis for comparison with theoretical predictions. The methodology presented here is very general and can provide a characterization of system behavior both at the level of individual pattern-forming agents and as a whole, allowing one to relate the results of image data analysis to processes occurring in a physical, chemical, or biological system in the real world.

Abstract: Modeling and evaluation of automated vehicles (AVs) in mixed-autonomy traffic is essential prior to their safe and efficient deployment. This is especially important at urban junctions where complex multi-agent interactions occur. Current approaches for modeling vehicular maneuvers and interactions at urban junctions have limitations in formulating non-cooperative interactions and vehicle dynamics within a unified mathematical framework. Previous studies either assume predefined paths or rely on cooperation and central controllability, limiting their realism and applicability in mixed-autonomy traffic. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a modeling framework for trajectory planning and decentralized vehicular control at urban junctions. The framework employs a bi-level structure where the upper level generates kinematically feasible reference trajectories using an efficient graph search algorithm with a custom heuristic function, while the lower level employs a predictive controller for trajectory tracking and optimization. Unlike existing approaches, our framework does not require central controllability or knowledge sharing among vehicles. The vehicle kinematics are explicitly incorporated at both levels, and acceleration and steering angle are used as control variables. This intuitive formulation facilitates analysis of traffic efficiency, environmental impacts, and motion comfort. The framework's decentralized structure accommodates operational and stochastic elements, such as vehicles' detection range, perception uncertainties, and reaction delay, making the model suitable for safety analysis. Numerical and simulation experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate the framework's capability in modeling accurate and realistic vehicular maneuvers and interactions at various urban junctions, including unsignalized intersections and roundabouts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to support various workflows across different disciplines, yet their potential in choice modelling remains relatively unexplored. This work examines the potential of LLMs as assistive agents in the specification and, where technically feasible, estimation of Multinomial Logit models. We implement a systematic experimental framework involving thirteen versions of six leading LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Gemma, and Llama) evaluated under five experimental configurations. These configurations vary along three dimensions: modelling goal (suggesting vs. suggesting and estimating MNLs); prompting strategy (Zero-Shot vs. Chain-of-Thoughts); and information availability (full dataset vs. data dictionary only). Each LLM-suggested specification is implemented, estimated, and evaluated based on goodness-of-fit metrics, behavioural plausibility, and model complexity. Findings reveal that proprietary LLMs can generate valid and behaviourally sound utility specifications, particularly when guided by structured prompts. Open-weight models such as Llama and Gemma struggled to produce meaningful specifications. Claude 4 Sonnet consistently produced the best-fitting and most complex models, while GPT models suggested models with robust and stable modelling outcomes. Some LLMs performed better when provided with just data dictionary, suggesting that limiting raw data access may enhance internal reasoning capabilities. Among all LLMs, GPT o3 was uniquely capable of correctly estimating its own specifications by executing self-generated code. Overall, the results demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of LLMs as assistive agents in choice modelling, not only for model specification but also for supporting modelling decision and estimation, and provide practical guidance for integrating these tools into choice modellers' workflows.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the structure of the embedding space of a transformer model trained for playing a particular reinforcement learning (RL) game. Specifically, we investigate how a transformer-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model embeds visual inputs in a simple environment where an agent must collect "coins" while avoiding dynamic obstacles consisting of "spotlights." By adapting Robinson et al.'s study of the volume growth transform for LLMs to the RL setting, we find that the token embedding space for our visual coin collecting game is also not a manifold, and is better modeled as a stratified space, where local dimension can vary from point to point. We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general volume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry out an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent representation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while following a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the agent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the environmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear). Consequently, our work suggests that the distribution of dimensions in a stratified latent space may provide a new geometric indicator of complexity for RL games.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second-deadliest malignancy in Western countries by 2030, highlighting the urgent need for better early detection. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), key precursors to pancreatic cancer, are challenging to assess with current guidelines, often leading to unnecessary surgeries or missed malignancies. We present Cyst-X, an AI framework that predicts IPMN malignancy using multicenter MRI data, leveraging MRI's superior soft tissue contrast over CT. Trained on 723 T1- and 738 T2-weighted scans from 764 patients across seven institutions, our models (AUC=0.82) significantly outperform both Kyoto guidelines (AUC=0.75) and expert radiologists. The AI-derived imaging features align with known clinical markers and offer biologically meaningful insights. We also demonstrate strong performance in a federated learning setting, enabling collaborative training without sharing patient data. To promote privacy-preserving AI development and improve IPMN risk stratification, the Cyst-X dataset is released as the first large-scale, multi-center pancreatic cysts MRI dataset.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a variant of hedonic games, called \textsc{Seat Arrangement}. The model is defined by a bijection from agents with preferences for each other to vertices in a graph $G$. The utility of an agent depends on the neighbors assigned in the graph. More precisely, it is the sum over all neighbors of the preferences that the agent has towards the agent assigned to the neighbor. We first consider the price of stability and fairness for different classes of preferences. In particular, we show that there is an instance such that the price of fairness ({\sf PoF}) is unbounded in general. Moreover, we show an upper bound $\tilde{d}(G)$ and an almost tight lower bound $\tilde{d}(G)-1/4$ of {\sf PoF}, where $\tilde{d}(G)$ is the average degree of an input graph. Then we investigate the computational complexity of problems to find certain ``good'' seat arrangements, say \textsc{Utilitarian Arrangement}, \textsc{Egalitarian Arrangement}, \textsc{Stable Arrangement}, and \textsc{Envy-free Arrangement}. We give dichotomies of computational complexity of four \textsc{Seat Arrangement} problems from the perspective of the maximum order of connected components in an input graph. For the parameterized complexity, \textsc{Utilitarian Arrangement} can be solved in time $n^{O(\gamma)}$, while it cannot be solved in time $f(\gamma)n^{o(\gamma)}$ under ETH, where $n$ is the number of agents and $\gamma$ is the vertex cover number of an input graph. Moreover, we show that \textsc{Egalitarian Arrangement} and \textsc{Envy-free Arrangement} are weakly NP-hard even on graphs of bounded vertex cover number. Finally, we prove that determining whether a stable arrangement can be obtained from a given arrangement by $k$ swaps is W[1]-hard when parameterized by $k+\gamma$, whereas it can be solved in time $n^{O(k)}$.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has witnessed a remarkable surge in interest, fueled by the empirical success achieved in applications of single-agent reinforcement learning (RL). In this study, we consider a distributed Q-learning scenario, wherein a number of agents cooperatively solve a sequential decision making problem without access to the central reward function which is an average of the local rewards. In particular, we study finite-time analysis of a distributed Q-learning algorithm, and provide a new sample complexity result of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \min\left\{\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\frac{t_{\text{mix}}}{(1-\gamma)^6 d_{\min}^4 } ,\frac{1}{\epsilon}\frac{\sqrt{|\gS||\gA|}}{(1-\sigma_2(\boldsymbol{W}))(1-\gamma)^4 d_{\min}^3} \right\}\right)$ under tabular lookup

Abstract: World models allow autonomous agents to plan and explore by predicting the visual outcomes of different actions. However, for robot manipulation, it is challenging to accurately model the fine-grained robot-object interaction within the visual space using existing methods which overlooks precise alignment between each action and the corresponding frame. In this paper, we present IRASim, a novel world model capable of generating videos with fine-grained robot-object interaction details, conditioned on historical observations and robot action trajectories. We train a diffusion transformer and introduce a novel frame-level action-conditioning module within each transformer block to explicitly model and strengthen the action-frame alignment. Extensive experiments show that: (1) the quality of the videos generated by our method surpasses all the baseline methods and scales effectively with increased model size and computation; (2) policy evaluations using IRASim exhibit a strong correlation with those using the ground-truth simulator, highlighting its potential to accelerate real-world policy evaluation; (3) testing-time scaling through model-based planning with IRASim significantly enhances policy performance, as evidenced by an improvement in the IoU metric on the Push-T benchmark from 0.637 to 0.961; (4) IRASim provides flexible action controllability, allowing virtual robotic arms in datasets to be controlled via a keyboard or VR controller.

<title>Effects of Vote Delegation in Blockchains: Who Wins?</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates which alternative benefits from vote delegation in binary collective decisions within blockchains. We begin by examining two extreme cases of voting weight distributions: Equal-Weight (EW), where each voter has equal voting weight, and Dominant-Weight (DW), where a single voter holds a majority of the voting weights before any delegation occurs. We show that vote delegation tends to benefit the ex-ante minority under EW, i.e., the alternative with a lower initial probability of winning. The converse holds under DW distribution. Through numerical simulations, we extend our findings to arbitrary voting weight distributions, showing that vote delegation benefits the ex-ante majority when it leads to a more balanced distribution of voting weights. Finally, in large communities where all agents have equal voting weight, vote delegation has a negligible impact on the outcome. As a practical consequence, vote delegation can be beneficial for blockchains with highly unbalanced voting rights, but not for those with balanced rights. In decentralized finance (DeFi), vote delegation is widely adopted to streamline governance and increase participation. However, it remains unclear when delegation actually aligns outcomes with community preferences.

<title>Strategist: Self-improvement of LLM Decision Making via Bi-Level Tree Search</title>

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning and planning typically requires vast amounts of data and training to develop effective policies. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities, but struggle with tasks that require detailed planning and decision-making in complex action spaces. We introduce STRATEGIST, a novel approach that integrates the strengths of both methods. Our approach leverages LLMs to search and update high-level strategies (as text), which are then refined and executed by low-level Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). STRATEGIST is a generalizable framework to optimize the strategy through population-based self-play simulations without the need for any training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of STRATEGIST in learning optimal strategies for competitive, multi-turn games with partial information, including Game of Pure Strategy (GOPS) and multi-agent, hidden-identity discussion games like The Resistance: Avalon. Our results show that agents equipped with STRATEGIST outperform those trained with traditional RL methods, other LLM-based skill acquisition techniques, pre-existing LLM agents across both game environments and achieves comparable performance against human players.

Abstract: Simulated patient systems play an important role in modern medical education and research, providing safe, integrative medical training environments and supporting clinical decision-making simulations. We developed AIPatient, an intelligent simulated patient system powered by large language model-based AI agents. The system incorporates the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, powered by six task-specific LLM-based AI agents for complex reasoning. For simulation reality, the system is also powered by the AIPatient KG (Knowledge Graph), built with de-identified real patient data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. Primary outcomes showcase the system's intelligence, including the system's accuracy in Electronic Record (EHR)-based medical Question Answering (QA), readability, robustness, and stability. The system achieved a QA accuracy of 94.15% when all six AI agents present, surpassing benchmarks with partial or no agent integration. Its knowledgebase demonstrated high validity (F1 score=0.89). Readability scores showed median Flesch Reading Ease at 77.23 and median Flesch Kincaid Grade at 5.6, indicating accessibility to all medical professionals. Robustness and stability were confirmed with non-significant variance (ANOVA F-value=0.6126, p > 0.1; F-value=0.782, p > 0.1). A user study with medical students further demonstrated that AIPatient offers high fidelity, strong usability, and effective educational value, performing comparably or better than human-simulated patients in medical history-taking scenarios. The promising intelligence of the AIPatient system highlights its potential to support a wide range of applications, including medical education, model evaluation, and system integration.

<title>Intrinsic Barriers and Practical Pathways for Human-AI Alignment: An Agreement-Based Complexity Analysis</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05934</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We formalize AI alignment as a multi-objective optimization problem called $\langle M,N,\varepsilon,\delta\rangle$-agreement that generalizes prior approaches with fewer assumptions, in which a set of $N$ agents (including humans) must reach approximate ($\varepsilon$) agreement across $M$ candidate objectives with probability at least $1-\delta$. Using communication complexity, we prove an information-theoretic lower bound demonstrating that once either $M$ or $N$ is large enough, no interaction or rationality can avoid intrinsic alignment overheads. This barrier establishes rigorous intrinsic limits to alignment \emph{itself}, not merely to specific methods, clarifying a crucial ``no free lunch'' principle: encoding ``all human values'' inevitably leads to misalignment, requiring future methods to explicitly manage complexity through consensus-driven reduction or prioritization of objectives. Complementing this impossibility result, we provide explicit algorithms achieving alignment under both computationally unbounded and bounded rationality with noisy messages. Even in these best-case scenarios where alignment to arbitrary precision is theoretically guaranteed, our analysis identifies three critical scalability barriers: the number of tasks ($M$), agents ($N$), and task state space size ($D$); thereby highlighting fundamental complexity-theoretic constraints and providing guidelines for safer, scalable human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Methods for navigation based on large-scale learning typically treat each episode as a new problem, where the agent is spawned with a clean memory in an unknown environment. While these generalization capabilities to an unknown environment are extremely important, we claim that, in a realistic setting, an agent should have the capacity of exploiting information collected during earlier robot operations. We address this by introducing a new retrieval-augmented agent, trained with RL, capable of querying a database collected from previous episodes in the same environment and learning how to integrate this additional context information. We introduce a unique agent architecture for the general navigation task, evaluated on ImageNav, Instance-ImageNav and ObjectNav. Our retrieval and context encoding methods are data-driven and employ vision foundation models (FM) for both semantic and geometric understanding. We propose new benchmarks for these settings and we show that retrieval allows zero-shot transfer across tasks and environments while significantly improving performance.

Abstract: Social media bots are AI agents that participate in online conversations. Most studies focus on the general bot and the malicious nature of these agents. However, bots have many different personas, each specialized towards a specific behavioral or content trait. Neither are bots singularly bad, because they are used for both good and bad information dissemination. In this article, we introduce fifteen agent personas of social media bots. These personas have two main categories: Content-Based Bot Persona and Behavior-Based Bot Persona. We also form yardsticks of the good-bad duality of the bots, elaborating on metrics of good and bad bot agents. Our work puts forth a guideline to inform bot detection regulation, emphasizing that policies should focus on how these agents are employed, rather than collectively terming bot agents as bad.

Abstract: As generative agents become increasingly capable, alignment of their behavior with complex human values remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches often simplify human intent through reduction to a scalar reward, overlooking the multi-faceted nature of human feedback. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework for preference-based Multi-Objective Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL), where human preferences are modeled as latent vector-valued reward functions. We formalize the problem of recovering a Pareto-optimal reward representation from noisy preference queries and establish conditions for identifying the underlying multi-objective structure. We derive tight sample complexity bounds for recovering $\epsilon$-approximations of the Pareto front and introduce a regret formulation to quantify suboptimality in this multi-objective setting. Furthermore, we propose a provably convergent algorithm for policy optimization using preference-inferred reward cones. Our results bridge the gap between practical alignment techniques and theoretical guarantees, providing a principled foundation for learning aligned behaviors in a high-dimension and value-pluralistic environment.

Abstract: Building embodied agents capable of accomplishing arbitrary tasks is a core objective towards achieving embodied artificial general intelligence (E-AGI). While recent work has advanced such general robot policies, their training and evaluation are often limited to tasks within specific scenes, involving restricted instructions and scenarios. Existing benchmarks also typically rely on manual annotation of limited tasks in a few scenes. We argue that exploring the full spectrum of feasible tasks within any given scene is crucial, as they provide both extensive benchmarks for evaluation and valuable resources for agent improvement. Towards this end, we introduce ManiTaskGen, a novel system that automatically generates comprehensive, diverse, feasible mobile manipulation tasks for any given scene. The generated tasks encompass both process-based, specific instructions (e.g., "move object from X to Y") and outcome-based, abstract instructions (e.g., "clear the table"). We apply ManiTaskGen to both simulated and real-world scenes, demonstrating the validity and diversity of the generated tasks. We then leverage these tasks to automatically construct benchmarks, thoroughly evaluating the embodied decision-making capabilities of agents built upon existing vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method that utilizes ManiTaskGen tasks to enhance embodied decision-making. Overall, this work presents a universal task generation framework for arbitrary scenes, facilitating both benchmarking and improvement of embodied decision-making agents.

<title>Automated Generation of Diverse Courses of Actions for Multi-Agent Operations using Binary Optimization and Graph Learning</title>

Abstract: Operations in disaster response, search \& rescue, and military missions that involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility. Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task operations.

Abstract: We formulate a vector cost alternative to the scalarization method for weighting and combining multi-objective costs. The algorithm produces solutions to bimatrix games that are simultaneously pure, unique Nash equilibria and Pareto optimal with guarantees for avoiding worst case outcomes. We achieve this by enforcing exact potential game constraints to guide cost adjustments towards equilibrium, while minimizing the deviation from the original cost structure. The magnitude of this adjustment serves as a metric for differentiating between Pareto optimal solutions. We implement this approach in a racing competition between agents with heterogeneous cost structures, resulting in fewer collision incidents with a minimal decrease in performance. Code is available at https://github.com/toazbenj/race_simulation.

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it. In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune, and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN) AGI system enabled by such a model.

Abstract: Generative agents have made significant progress in simulating human behavior, but existing frameworks often simplify emotional modeling and focus primarily on specific tasks, limiting the authenticity of the simulation. Our work proposes the Psychological-mechanism Agent (PSYA) framework, based on the Cognitive Triangle (Feeling-Thought-Action), designed to more accurately simulate human behavior. The PSYA consists of three core modules: the Feeling module (using a layer model of affect to simulate changes in short-term, medium-term, and long-term emotions), the Thought module (based on the Triple Network Model to support goal-directed and spontaneous thinking), and the Action module (optimizing agent behavior through the integration of emotions, needs and plans). To evaluate the framework's effectiveness, we conducted daily life simulations and extended the evaluation metrics to self-influence, one-influence, and group-influence, selection five classic psychological experiments for simulation. The results show that the PSYA framework generates more natural, consistent, diverse, and credible behaviors, successfully replicating human experimental outcomes. Our work provides a richer and more accurate emotional and cognitive modeling approach for generative agents and offers an alternative to human participants in psychological experiments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for tailored healthcare communication but face challenges in interpretability and multi-task integration particularly for domain-specific needs like myopia, and their real-world effectiveness as patient education tools has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we introduce ChatMyopia, an LLM-based AI agent designed to address text and image-based inquiries related to myopia. To achieve this, ChatMyopia integrates an image classification tool and a retrieval-augmented knowledge base built from literature, expert consensus, and clinical guidelines. Myopic maculopathy grading task, single question examination and human evaluations validated its ability to deliver personalized, accurate, and safe responses to myopia-related inquiries with high scalability and interpretability. In a randomized controlled trial (n=70, NCT06607822), ChatMyopia significantly improved patient satisfaction compared to traditional leaflets, enhancing patient education in accuracy, empathy, disease awareness, and patient-eyecare practitioner communication. These findings highlight ChatMyopia's potential as a valuable supplement to enhance patient education and improve satisfaction with medical services in primary eye care settings.

Abstract: Javed, Sharifnassab, and Sutton (2024) introduced a new algorithm for TD learning -- SwiftTD -- that augments True Online TD($\lambda$) with step-size optimization, a bound on the effective learning rate, and step-size decay. In their experiments SwiftTD outperformed True Online TD($\lambda$) and TD($\lambda$) on a variety of prediction tasks derived from Atari games, and its performance was robust to the choice of hyper-parameters. In this extended abstract we extend SwiftTD to work for control problems. We combine the key ideas behind SwiftTD with True Online Sarsa($\lambda$) to develop an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm called $\textit{Swift-Sarsa}$.
  We propose a simple benchmark for linear on-policy control called the $\textit{operant conditioning benchmark}$. The key challenge in the operant conditioning benchmark is that a very small subset of input signals are relevant for decision making. The majority of the signals are noise sampled from a non-stationary distribution. To learn effectively, the agent must learn to differentiate between the relevant signals and the noisy signals, and minimize prediction errors by assigning credit to the weight parameters associated with the relevant signals.
  Swift-Sarsa, when applied to the operant conditioning benchmark, learned to assign credit to the relevant signals without any prior knowledge of the structure of the problem. It opens the door for solution methods that learn representations by searching over hundreds of millions of features in parallel without performance degradation due to noisy or bad features.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems but often struggle with long, conditional workflows that involve external tool calls and depend on user-specific information. We present Workflow Adherence via Runtime Parallel Personalization, or WARPP, a training-free, modular framework that combines multi-agent orchestration with runtime personalization to improve workflow adherence in LLM-based systems. By dynamically pruning conditional branches based on user attributes, the framework reduces reasoning overhead and narrows tool selection at runtime. WARPP deploys a parallelized architecture where a dedicated Personalizer agent operates alongside modular, domain-specific agents to dynamically tailor execution paths in real time. The framework is evaluated across five representative user intents of varying complexity within three domains: banking, flights, and healthcare. Our evaluation leverages synthetic datasets and LLM-powered simulated users to test scenarios with conditional dependencies. Our results demonstrate that WARPP outperforms both the non-personalized method and the ReAct baseline, achieving increasingly larger gains in parameter fidelity and tool accuracy as intent complexity grows, while also reducing average token usage, without any additional training.

Abstract: This research article presents a novel architecture to empower multi-agent economies by addressing two critical limitations of the emerging Agent2Agent (A2A) communication protocol: decentralized agent discoverability and agent-to-agent micropayments. By integrating distributed ledger technology (DLT), this architecture enables tamper-proof, on-chain publishing of AgentCards as smart contracts, providing secure and verifiable agent identities. The architecture further extends A2A with the x402 open standard, facilitating blockchain-agnostic, HTTP-based micropayments via the HTTP 402 status code. This enables autonomous agents to seamlessly discover, authenticate, and compensate each other across organizational boundaries. This work further presents a comprehensive technical implementation and evaluation, demonstrating the feasibility of DLT-based agent discovery and micropayments. The proposed approach lays the groundwork for secure, scalable, and economically viable multi-agent ecosystems, advancing the field of agentic AI toward trusted, autonomous economic interactions.

Abstract: This paper presents MCP4EDA, the first Model Context Protocol server that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and optimize the complete open-source RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interaction. The system integrates Yosys synthesis, Icarus Verilog simulation, OpenLane place-and-route, GTKWave analysis, and KLayout visualization into a unified LLM-accessible interface, enabling designers to execute complex multi-tool EDA workflows conversationally via AI assistants such as Claude Desktop and Cursor IDE. The principal contribution is a backend-aware synthesis optimization methodology wherein LLMs analyze actual post-layout timing, power, and area metrics from OpenLane results to iteratively refine synthesis TCL scripts, establishing a closed-loop optimization system that bridges the traditional gap between synthesis estimates and physical implementation reality. In contrast to conventional flows that rely on wire-load models, this methodology leverages real backend performance data to guide synthesis parameter tuning, optimization sequence selection, and constraint refinement, with the LLM functioning as an intelligent design space exploration agent. Experimental evaluation on representative digital designs demonstrates 15-30% improvements in timing closure and 10-20% area reduction compared to default synthesis flows, establishing MCP4EDA as the first practical LLM-controlled end-to-end open-source EDA automation system. The code and demo are avaiable at: http://www.agent4eda.com/

<title>Hypergames: Modeling Misaligned Perceptions and Nested Beliefs for Multi-agent Systems</title>

Abstract: Classical game-theoretic models typically assume rational agents, complete information, and common knowledge of payoffs - assumptions that are often violated in real-world MAS characterized by uncertainty, misaligned perceptions, and nested beliefs. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints, subjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory extends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective perceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which agents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available actions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of hypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted to dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from cybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general game-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory and its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop agent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to assess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals prevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based models in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical frameworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including the limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame languages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and agent-agent misalignment. By synthesizing trends, challenges, and open research directions, this review provides a new roadmap for applying hypergame theory to enhance the realism and effectiveness of strategic modeling in dynamic multi-agent environments.

<title>Diversity and Interaction Quality of a Heterogeneous Multi-Agent System Applied to a Synchronization Problem</title>

arXiv:2507.19631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, scalable controller design to achieve output synchronization for a heterogeneous discrete-time nonlinear multi-agent system is considered. The agents are assumed to exhibit potentially nonlinear dynamics but share linear common oscillatory modes. In a distributed control architecture, scalability is ensured by designing a small number of distinguished controllers, significantly fewer than the number of agents, even when agent diversity is high. Our findings indicate that the number of controllers required can be effectively determined by the number of strongly connected components of the underlying graph. The study in this paper builds on the recently developed phase theory of matrices and systems. First, we employ the concept of matrix phase, specifically the phase alignability of a collection of matrices, to quantify agent diversity. Next, we use matrix phase, particularly the essential phase of the graph Laplacian, to evaluate the interaction quality among the agents. Based on these insights, we derive a sufficient condition for the solvability of the synchronization problem, framed as a trade-off between the agent diversity and the interaction quality. In the process, a controller design procedure based on Lyapunov analysis is provided, which produces low gain, component-wise synchronizing controllers when the solvability condition is satisfied. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedure. Furthermore, we consider cases where the component-wise controller design problem is unsolvable. We propose alternative strategies involving the design of a small inventory of controllers, which can still achieve synchronization effectively by employing certain clustering methods to manage heterogeneity.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a dominant workload in a wide range of applications, promising to be the vehicle that delivers the promised benefits of AI to enterprises and consumers. Unlike conventional software or static inference, agentic workloads are dynamic and structurally complex. Often these agents are directed graphs of compute and IO operations that span multi-modal data input and conversion), data processing and context gathering (e.g vector DB lookups), multiple LLM inferences, tool calls, etc. To scale AI agent usage, we need efficient and scalable deployment and agent-serving infrastructure.
  To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present a system design for dynamic orchestration of AI agent workloads on heterogeneous compute infrastructure spanning CPUs and accelerators, both from different vendors and across different performance tiers within a single vendor. The system delivers several building blocks: a framework for planning and optimizing agentic AI execution graphs using cost models that account for compute, memory, and bandwidth constraints of different HW; a MLIR based representation and compilation system that can decompose AI agent execution graphs into granular operators and generate code for different HW options; and a dynamic orchestration system that can place the granular components across a heterogeneous compute infrastructure and stitch them together while meeting an end-to-end SLA. Our design performs a systems level TCO optimization and preliminary results show that leveraging a heterogeneous infrastructure can deliver significant TCO benefits. A preliminary surprising finding is that for some workloads a heterogeneous combination of older generation GPUs with newer accelerators can deliver similar TCO as the latest generation homogenous GPU infrastructure design, potentially extending the life of deployed infrastructure.

<title>GABRIL: Gaze-Based Regularization for Mitigating Causal Confusion in Imitation Learning</title>

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely adopted approach which enables agents to learn from human expert demonstrations by framing the task as a supervised learning problem. However, IL often suffers from causal confusion, where agents misinterpret spurious correlations as causal relationships, leading to poor performance in testing environments with distribution shift. To address this issue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a novel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data collection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a regularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant features identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects of confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and the Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and applying our method in both domains. Experimental results show that the improvement of GABRIL over behavior cloning is around 179% more than the same number for other baselines in the Atari and 76% in the CARLA setup. Finally, we show that our method provides extra explainability when compared to regular IL agents.

Abstract: The development of next-generation networking systems has inherently shifted from throughput-based paradigms towards intelligent, information-aware designs that emphasize the quality, relevance, and utility of transmitted information, rather than sheer data volume. While classical network metrics, such as latency and packet loss, remain significant, they are insufficient to quantify the nuanced information quality requirements of modern intelligent applications, including autonomous vehicles, digital twins, and metaverse environments. In this survey, we present the first comprehensive study of the ``X of Information'' continuum by introducing a systematic four-dimensional taxonomic framework that structures information metrics along temporal, quality/utility, reliability/robustness, and network/communication dimensions. We uncover the increasing interdependencies among these dimensions, whereby temporal freshness triggers quality evaluation, which in turn helps with reliability appraisal, ultimately enabling effective network delivery. Our analysis reveals that artificial intelligence technologies, such as deep reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and neural optimization models, enable adaptive, context-aware optimization of competing information quality objectives. In our extensive study of six critical application domains, covering autonomous transportation, industrial IoT, healthcare digital twins, UAV communications, LLM ecosystems, and metaverse settings, we illustrate the revolutionary promise of multi-dimensional information metrics for meeting diverse operational needs. Our survey identifies prominent implementation challenges, including ...

Abstract: Imagine a humanoid that can safely and creatively dance with a human, adapting to its partner's proficiency, using haptic signaling as a primary form of communication. While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive, expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types, combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation) generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive humanoid motion generation.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of future agent trajectories is a critical challenge for ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation, particularly in complex urban environments characterized by multiple plausible future scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid approach that integrates learning-based with physics-based constraints to address the multi-modality inherent in trajectory prediction. Our method employs a variational Bayesian mixture model to effectively capture the diverse range of potential future behaviors, moving beyond traditional unimodal assumptions. Unlike prior approaches that predominantly treat trajectory prediction as a data-driven regression task, our framework incorporates physical realism through sector-specific boundary conditions and Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based smoothing. These constraints ensure that predicted trajectories are not only data-consistent but also physically plausible, adhering to kinematic and dynamic principles. Furthermore, our method produces interpretable and diverse trajectory predictions, enabling enhanced downstream decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of each component and highlight their synergistic impact on prediction accuracy and reliability. By balancing data-driven insights with physics-informed constraints, our approach offers a robust and scalable solution for navigating the uncertainties of real-world urban environments.

<title>Oranits: Mission Assignment and Task Offloading in Open RAN-based ITS using Metaheuristic and Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore mission assignment and task offloading in an Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN)-based intelligent transportation system (ITS), where autonomous vehicles leverage mobile edge computing for efficient processing. Existing studies often overlook the intricate interdependencies between missions and the costs associated with offloading tasks to edge servers, leading to suboptimal decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission dependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle cooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach. First, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm, namely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline for one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double Deep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and multi-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment time and improving adaptability over baseline methods. Extensive simulations reveal that CGG-ARO improves the number of completed missions and overall benefit by approximately 7.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, MA-DDQN achieves even greater improvements of 11.0% in terms of mission completions and 12.5% in terms of the overall benefit. These results highlight the effectiveness of Oranits in enabling faster, more adaptive, and more efficient task processing in dynamic ITS environments.

<title>Beyond Nearest Neighbors: Semantic Compression and Graph-Augmented Retrieval for Enhanced Vector Search</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.19715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector databases typically rely on approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to retrieve the top-k closest vectors to a query in embedding space. While effective, this approach often yields semantically redundant results, missing the diversity and contextual richness required by applications such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-hop QA, and memory-augmented agents. We introduce a new retrieval paradigm: semantic compression, which aims to select a compact, representative set of vectors that captures the broader semantic structure around a query. We formalize this objective using principles from submodular optimization and information geometry, and show that it generalizes traditional top-k retrieval by prioritizing coverage and diversity. To operationalize this idea, we propose graph-augmented vector retrieval, which overlays semantic graphs (e.g., kNN or knowledge-based links) atop vector spaces to enable multi-hop, context-aware search. We theoretically analyze the limitations of proximity-based retrieval under high-dimensional concentration and highlight how graph structures can improve semantic coverage. Our work outlines a foundation for meaning-centric vector search systems, emphasizing hybrid indexing, diversity-aware querying, and structured semantic retrieval. We make our implementation publicly available to foster future research in this area.

Abstract: Games are challenging for Reinforcement Learning~(RL) agents due to their reward-sparsity, as rewards are only obtainable after long sequences of deliberate actions. Intrinsic Motivation~(IM) methods -- which introduce exploration rewards -- are an effective solution to reward-sparsity. However, IM also causes an issue known as `reward hacking' where the agent optimizes for the new reward at the expense of properly playing the game. The larger problem is that reward hacking itself is largely unknown; there is no answer to whether, and to what extent, IM rewards change the behavior of RL agents. This study takes a first step by empirically evaluating the impact on behavior of three IM techniques on the MiniGrid game-like environment. We compare these IM models with Generalized Reward Matching~(GRM), a method that can be used with any intrinsic reward function to guarantee optimality. Our results suggest that IM causes noticeable change by increasing the initial rewards, but also altering the way the agent plays; and that GRM mitigated reward hacking in some scenarios.

Abstract: Particle filter-based 2D-SLAM is widely used in indoor localization tasks due to its efficiency. However, indoor environments such as long straight corridors can cause severe degeneracy problems in SLAM. In this paper, we use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train an adaptive degeneracy optimization agent (DOA) to address degeneracy problem. We propose a systematic methodology to address three critical challenges in traditional supervised learning frameworks: (1) data acquisition bottlenecks in degenerate dataset, (2) inherent quality deterioration of training samples, and (3) ambiguity in annotation protocol design. We design a specialized reward function to guide the agent in developing perception capabilities for degenerate environments. Using the output degeneracy factor as a reference weight, the agent can dynamically adjust the contribution of different sensors to pose optimization. Specifically, the observation distribution is shifted towards the motion model distribution, with the step size determined by a linear interpolation formula related to the degeneracy factor. In addition, we employ a transfer learning module to endow the agent with generalization capabilities across different environments and address the inefficiency of training in degenerate environments. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the rationality of our model design and the role of transfer learning. We also compare the proposed DOA with SOTA methods to prove its superior degeneracy detection and optimization capabilities across various environments.

Abstract: Structural drawings are widely used in many fields, e.g., mechanical engineering, civil engineering, etc. In civil engineering, structural drawings serve as the main communication tool between architects, engineers, and builders to avoid conflicts, act as legal documentation, and provide a reference for future maintenance or evaluation needs. They are often organized using key elements such as title/subtitle blocks, scales, plan views, elevation view, sections, and detailed sections, which are annotated with standardized symbols and line types for interpretation by engineers and contractors. Despite advances in software capabilities, the task of generating a structural drawing remains labor-intensive and time-consuming for structural engineers. Here we introduce a novel generative AI-based method for generating structural drawings employing a large language model (LLM) agent. The method incorporates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique using externally-sourced facts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the language model. This method is capable of understanding varied natural language descriptions, processing these to extract necessary information, and generating code to produce the desired structural drawing in AutoCAD. The approach developed, demonstrated and evaluated herein enables the efficient and direct conversion of a structural drawing's natural language description into an AutoCAD drawing, significantly reducing the workload compared to current working process associated with manual drawing production, facilitating the typical iterative process of engineers for expressing design ideas in a simplified way.

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation, fundamental to human daily activities, remains a challenging task due to its inherent complexity of coordinated control. Recent advances have enabled zero-shot learning of single-arm manipulation skills through agent-agnostic visual representations derived from human videos; however, these methods overlook crucial agent-specific information necessary for bimanual coordination, such as end-effector positions. We propose Ag2x2, a computational framework for bimanual manipulation through coordination-aware visual representations that jointly encode object states and hand motion patterns while maintaining agent-agnosticism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ag2x2 achieves a 73.5% success rate across 13 diverse bimanual tasks from Bi-DexHands and PerAct2, including challenging scenarios with deformable objects like ropes. This performance outperforms baseline methods and even surpasses the success rate of policies trained with expert-engineered rewards. Furthermore, we show that representations learned through Ag2x2 can be effectively leveraged for imitation learning, establishing a scalable pipeline for skill acquisition without expert supervision. By maintaining robust performance across diverse tasks without human demonstrations or engineered rewards, Ag2x2 represents a step toward scalable learning of complex bimanual robotic skills.

Abstract: This paper introduces a model for coordinating prosumers with heterogeneous distributed energy resources (DERs), participating in the local energy market (LEM) that interacts with the market-clearing entity. The proposed LEM scheme utilizes a data-driven, model-free reinforcement learning approach based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enabling prosumers to make real-time decisions on whether to buy, sell, or refrain from any action while facilitating efficient coordination for optimal energy trading in a dynamic market. In addition, we investigate a price manipulation strategy using a variational auto encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN) model, which allows utilities to adjust price signals in a way that induces financial losses for the prosumers. Our results show that under adversarial pricing, heterogeneous prosumer groups, particularly those lacking generation capabilities, incur financial losses. The same outcome holds across LEMs of different sizes. As the market size increases, trading stabilizes and fairness improves through emergent cooperation among agents.

Abstract: Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models' intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/dongguanting/ARPO

Abstract: Hand-eye calibration is an important task in vision-guided robotic systems and is crucial for determining the transformation matrix between the camera coordinate system and the robot end-effector. Existing methods, for multi-view robotic systems, usually rely on accurate geometric models or manual assistance, generalize poorly, and can be very complicated and inefficient. Therefore, in this study, we propose PlaneHEC, a generalized hand-eye calibration method that does not require complex models and can be accomplished using only depth cameras, which achieves the optimal and fastest calibration results using arbitrary planar surfaces like walls and tables. PlaneHEC introduces hand-eye calibration equations based on planar constraints, which makes it strongly interpretable and generalizable. PlaneHEC also uses a comprehensive solution that starts with a closed-form solution and improves it withiterative optimization, which greatly improves accuracy. We comprehensively evaluated the performance of PlaneHEC in both simulated and real-world environments and compared the results with other point-cloud-based calibration methods, proving its superiority. Our approach achieves universal and fast calibration with an innovative design of computational models, providing a strong contribution to the development of multi-agent systems and embodied intelligence.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked unprecedented capabilities in high-level task planning. However, most current systems operate in an open-loop fashion, where LLMs act as one-shot planners, rendering them brittle and unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances in dynamic physical environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the "Think, Act, Learn" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that enables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through continuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an LLM first "thinks" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans. The robot then "acts" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal sensory feedback. Critically, the "learn" module processes this feedback to facilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal analysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are stored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We demonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world that our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including open-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning. Our framework achieves over a 97% success rate on complex, long-horizon tasks, converges to a stable policy in an average of just 9 trials, and exhibits remarkable generalization to unseen tasks. This work presents a significant step towards developing more robust, adaptive, and truly autonomous robotic agents.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory planning requires ensuring both safety and efficiency, yet deadlocks remain a significant challenge, especially in obstacle-dense environments. Such deadlocks frequently occur when multiple agents attempt to traverse the same long and narrow corridor simultaneously. To address this, we propose a novel distributed trajectory planning framework that bridges the gap between global path and local trajectory cooperation. At the global level, a homotopy-aware optimal path planning algorithm is proposed, which fully leverages the topological structure of the environment. A reference path is chosen from distinct homotopy classes by considering both its spatial and temporal properties, leading to improved coordination among agents globally. At the local level, a model predictive control-based trajectory optimization method is used to generate dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories. Additionally, an online replanning strategy ensures its adaptability to dynamic environments. Simulations and experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating deadlocks. Ablation studies demonstrate that by incorporating time-aware homotopic properties into the underlying global paths, our method can significantly reduce deadlocks and improve the average success rate from 4%-13% to over 90% in randomly generated dense scenarios.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a significant advancement in AI-tool integration, enabling seamless communication between AI agents and external services. However, this connectivity introduces novel attack vectors that remain largely unexplored. This paper demonstrates how unsophisticated threat actors, requiring only basic programming skills and free web tools, can exploit MCP's trust model to exfiltrate sensitive financial data. We present a proof-of-concept attack where a malicious weather MCP server, disguised as benign functionality, discovers and exploits legitimate banking tools to steal user account balances. The attack chain requires no advanced technical knowledge, server infrastructure, or monetary investment. The findings reveal a critical security gap in the emerging MCP ecosystem: while individual servers may appear trustworthy, their combination creates unexpected cross-server attack surfaces. Unlike traditional cybersecurity threats that assume sophisticated adversaries, our research shows that the barrier to entry for MCP-based attacks is alarmingly low. A threat actor with undergraduate-level Python knowledge can craft convincing social engineering attacks that exploit the implicit trust relationships MCP establishes between AI agents and tool providers. This work contributes to the nascent field of MCP security by demonstrating that current MCP implementations allow trivial cross-server attacks and proposing both immediate mitigations and protocol improvements to secure this emerging ecosystem.

Abstract: Software development is a complex, multi-phase process traditionally requiring collaboration among individuals with diverse expertise. We propose AgentMesh, a Python-based framework that uses multiple cooperating LLM-powered agents to automate software development tasks. In AgentMesh, specialized agents - a Planner, Coder, Debugger, and Reviewer - work in concert to transform a high-level requirement into fully realized code. The Planner agent first decomposes user requests into concrete subtasks; the Coder agent implements each subtask in code; the Debugger agent tests and fixes the code; and the Reviewer agent validates the final output for correctness and quality. We describe the architecture and design of these agents and their communication, and provide implementation details including prompt strategies and workflow orchestration. A case study illustrates AgentMesh handling a non-trivial development request via sequential task planning, code generation, iterative debugging, and final code review. We discuss how dividing responsibilities among cooperative agents leverages the strengths of large language models while mitigating single-agent limitations. Finally, we examine current limitations - such as error propagation and context scaling - and outline future work toward more robust, scalable multi-agent AI systems for software engineering automation.

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents, such as SWE-agent and OpenHands, have made progress toward automated issue resolution. However, existing approaches are often limited to Python-only issues and rely on pre-constructed containers in SWE-bench with reproduced issues, restricting their applicability to real-world and work for multi-language repositories. We present Prometheus, designed to resolve real-world issues beyond benchmark settings. Prometheus is a multi-agent system that transforms an entire code repository into a unified knowledge graph to guide context retrieval for issue resolution. Prometheus encodes files, abstract syntax trees, and natural language text into a graph of typed nodes and five general edge types to support multiple programming languages. Prometheus uses Neo4j for graph persistence, enabling scalable and structured reasoning over large codebases. Integrated by the DeepSeek-V3 model, Prometheus resolves 28.67% and 13.7% of issues on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Multilingual, respectively, with an average API cost of $0.23 and $0.38 per issue. Prometheus resolves 10 unique issues not addressed by prior work and is the first to demonstrate effectiveness across seven programming languages. Moreover, it shows the ability to resolve real-world GitHub issues in the LangChain and OpenHands repositories. We have open-sourced Prometheus at: https://github.com/Pantheon-temple/Prometheus

Abstract: Automated data visualization plays a crucial role in simplifying data interpretation, enhancing decision-making, and improving efficiency. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating visualizations from natural language, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks limits the rigorous evaluation of their capabilities. We introduce Text2Vis, a benchmark designed to assess text-to-visualization models, covering 20+ chart types and diverse data science queries, including trend analysis, correlation, outlier detection, and predictive analytics. It comprises 1,985 samples, each with a data table, natural language query, short answer, visualization code, and annotated charts. The queries involve complex reasoning, conversational turns, and dynamic data retrieval. We benchmark 11 open-source and closed-source models, revealing significant performance gaps, highlighting key challenges, and offering insights for future advancements. To close this gap, we propose the first cross-modal actor-critic agentic framework that jointly refines the textual answer and visualization code, increasing GPT-4o`s pass rate from 26% to 42% over the direct approach and improving chart quality. We also introduce an automated LLM-based evaluation framework that enables scalable assessment across thousands of samples without human annotation, measuring answer correctness, code execution success, visualization readability, and chart accuracy. We release Text2Vis at https://github.com/vis-nlp/Text2Vis.

<title>Finding Personalized Good-Enough Solutions to Unsatisfiable Stable Roommates Problems</title>

Abstract: The Stable Roommates problems are characterized by the preferences of agents over other agents as roommates. A solution is a partition of the agents into pairs that are acceptable to each other (i.e., they are in the preference lists of each other), and the matching is stable (i.e., there do not exist any two agents who prefer each other to their roommates, and thus block the matching). Motivated by real-world applications, and considering that stable roommates problems do not always have solutions, we continue our studies to compute "good-enough" matchings. In addition to the agents' habits and habitual preferences, we consider their networks of preferred friends, and introduce a method to generate personalized solutions to stable roommates problems. We illustrate the usefulness of our method with examples and empirical evaluations.

<title>Generating Satisfiable Benchmark Instances for Stable Roommates Problems with Optimization</title>

Abstract: While the existence of a stable matching for the stable roommates problem possibly with incomplete preference lists (SRI) can be decided in polynomial time, SRI problems with some fairness criteria are intractable. Egalitarian SRI that tries to maximize the total satisfaction of agents if a stable matching exists, is such a hard variant of SRI. For experimental evaluations of methods to solve these hard variants of SRI, several well-known algorithms have been used to randomly generate benchmark instances. However, these benchmark instances are not always satisfiable, and usually have a small number of stable matchings if one exists. For such SRI instances, despite the NP-hardness of Egalitarian SRI, it is practical to find an egalitarian stable matching by enumerating all stable matchings. In this study, we introduce a novel algorithm to generate benchmark instances for SRI that have very large numbers of solutions, and for which it is hard to find an egalitarian stable matching by enumerating all stable matchings.

<title>An Algorithm-to-Contract Framework without Demand Queries</title>

Abstract: Consider costly tasks that add up to the success of a project, and must be fitted by an agent into a given time-frame. This is an instance of the classic budgeted maximization problem, which admits an approximation scheme (FPTAS). Now assume the agent is performing these tasks on behalf of a principal, who is the one to reap the rewards if the project succeeds. The principal must design a contract to incentivize the agent. Is there still an approximation scheme? In this work, our ultimate goal is an algorithm-to-contract transformation, which transforms algorithms for combinatorial problems (like budgeted maximization) to tackle incentive constraints that arise in contract design. Our approach diverges from previous works on combinatorial contract design by avoiding an assumption of black-box access to a demand oracle.
  We first show how to "lift" the FPTAS for budgeted maximization to obtain the best-possible multiplicative and additive FPTAS for the contract design problem. We establish this through our "local-global" framework, in which the "local" step is to (approximately) solve a two-sided strengthened variant of the demand problem. The "global" step then utilizes the local one to find the approximately optimal contract. We apply our framework to a host of combinatorial constraints including multi-dimensional budgets, budgeted matroid, and budgeted matching constraints. In all cases we achieve an approximation essentially matching the best approximation for the purely algorithmic problem. We also develop a method to tackle multi-agent contract settings, where the team of working agents must abide to combinatorial feasibility constraints.

Abstract: Preserving ancient languages is essential for understanding humanity's cultural and linguistic heritage, yet Old English remains critically under-resourced, limiting its accessibility to modern natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We present a scalable framework that uses advanced large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality Old English texts, addressing this gap. Our approach combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning (Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA), data augmentation via backtranslation, and a dual-agent pipeline that separates the tasks of content generation (in English) and translation (into Old English). Evaluation with automated metrics (BLEU, METEOR, and CHRF) shows significant improvements over baseline models, with BLEU scores increasing from 26 to over 65 for English-to-Old English translation. Expert human assessment also confirms high grammatical accuracy and stylistic fidelity in the generated texts. Beyond expanding the Old English corpus, our method offers a practical blueprint for revitalizing other endangered languages, effectively uniting AI innovation with the goals of cultural preservation.

<title>RESCUE: Crowd Evacuation Simulation via Controlling SDM-United Characters</title>

Abstract: Crowd evacuation simulation is critical for enhancing public safety, and demanded for realistic virtual environments. Current mainstream evacuation models overlook the complex human behaviors that occur during evacuation, such as pedestrian collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations in behavior influenced by terrain types or individual body shapes. This results in the failure to accurately simulate the escape of people in the real world. In this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a Personalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move in parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd awareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist in evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework supports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent throughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain. Visually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and plausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation. The code is available at http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/likun/projects/RESCUE.

<title>Concept Learning for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in applying neural networks (NN) to multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) areas, they still largely suffer from a lack of transparency and interoperability. However, its implicit cooperative mechanism is not yet fully understood due to black-box networks. In this work, we study an interpretable value decomposition framework via concept bottleneck models, which promote trustworthiness by conditioning credit assignment on an intermediate level of human-like cooperation concepts. To address this problem, we propose a novel value-based method, named Concepts learning for Multi-agent Q-learning (CMQ), that goes beyond the current performance-vs-interpretability trade-off by learning interpretable cooperation concepts. CMQ represents each cooperation concept as a supervised vector, as opposed to existing models where the information flowing through their end-to-end mechanism is concept-agnostic. Intuitively, using individual action value conditioning on global state embeddings to represent each concept allows for extra cooperation representation capacity. Empirical evaluations on the StarCraft II micromanagement challenge and level-based foraging (LBF) show that CMQ achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. The results also demonstrate that CMQ provides more cooperation concept representation capturing meaningful cooperation modes, and supports test-time concept interventions for detecting potential biases of cooperation mode and identifying spurious artifacts that impact cooperation.

<title>Multi-Agent Interactive Question Generation Framework for Long Document Understanding</title>

Abstract: Document Understanding (DU) in long-contextual scenarios with complex layouts remains a significant challenge in vision-language research. Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at short-context DU tasks, their performance declines in long-context settings. A key limitation is the scarcity of fine-grained training data, particularly for low-resource languages such as Arabic. Existing state-of-the-art techniques rely heavily on human annotation, which is costly and inefficient. We propose a fully automated, multi-agent interactive framework to generate long-context questions efficiently. Our approach efficiently generates high-quality single- and multi-page questions for extensive English and Arabic documents, covering hundreds of pages across diverse domains. This facilitates the development of LVLMs with enhanced long-context understanding ability. Experimental results in this work have shown that our generated English and Arabic questions (\textbf{AraEngLongBench}) are quite challenging to major open- and close-source LVLMs. The code and data proposed in this work can be found in https://github.com/wangk0b/Multi_Agentic_QA_Long_Doc.git. Sample Question and Answer (QA) pairs and structured system prompts can be found in the Appendix.

Abstract: User simulators are essential to conversational AI, enabling scalable agent development and evaluation through simulated interactions. While current Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced user simulation capabilities, we reveal that they struggle to consistently demonstrate goal-oriented behavior across multi-turn conversations--a critical limitation that compromises their reliability in downstream applications. We introduce User Goal State Tracking (UGST), a novel framework that tracks user goal progression throughout conversations. Leveraging UGST, we present a three-stage methodology for developing user simulators that can autonomously track goal progression and reason to generate goal-aligned responses. Moreover, we establish comprehensive evaluation metrics for measuring goal alignment in user simulators, and demonstrate that our approach yields substantial improvements across two benchmarks (MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench). Our contributions address a critical gap in conversational AI and establish UGST as an essential framework for developing goal-aligned user simulators.

Abstract: Many real-world systems, such as transportation systems, ecological systems, and Internet systems, are complex systems. As an important tool for studying complex systems, computational experiments can map them into artificial society models that are computable and reproducible within computers, thereby providing digital and computational methods for quantitative analysis. In current research, the construction of individual agent models often ignores the long-term accumulative effect of memory mechanisms in the development process of agents, which to some extent causes the constructed models to deviate from the real characteristics of real-world systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an individual agent model based on a memory-learning collaboration mechanism, which implements hierarchical modeling of the memory mechanism and a multi-indicator evaluation mechanism. Through hierarchical modeling of the individual memory repository, the group memory repository, and the memory buffer pool, memory can be effectively managed, and knowledge sharing and dissemination between individuals and groups can be promoted. At the same time, the multi-indicator evaluation mechanism enables dynamic evaluation of memory information, allowing dynamic updates of information in the memory set and promoting collaborative decision-making between memory and learning. Experimental results show that, compared with existing memory modeling methods, the agents constructed by the proposed model demonstrate better decision-making quality and adaptability within the system. This verifies the effectiveness of the individual agent model based on the memory-learning collaboration mechanism proposed in this paper in improving the quality of individual-level modeling in artificial society modeling and achieving anthropomorphic characteristics.

Abstract: To fully expedite AI-powered chemical research, high-quality chemical databases are the cornerstone. Automatic extraction of chemical information from the literature is essential for constructing reaction databases, but it is currently limited by the multimodality and style variability of chemical information. In this work, we developed a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based multi-agent system for automatic chemical information extraction. We used the MLLM's strong reasoning capability to understand the structure of complex chemical graphics, decompose the extraction task into sub-tasks and coordinate a set of specialized agents to solve them. Our system achieved an F1 score of 80.8% on a benchmark dataset of complex chemical reaction graphics from the literature, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model (F1 score: 35.6%) by a significant margin. Additionally, it demonstrated consistent improvements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction image parsing, named entity recognition and text-based reaction extraction. This work is a critical step toward automated chemical information extraction into structured datasets, which will be a strong promoter of AI-driven chemical research.

Abstract: Enhancing resilience in multi-agent systems in the face of selfish agents is an important problem that requires further characterisation. This work develops a truthful mechanism that avoids self-interested and strategic agents maliciously manipulating the algorithm. We prove theoretically that the proposed mechanism incentivises self-interested agents to participate and follow the provided algorithm faithfully. Additionally, the mechanism is compatible with any distributed optimisation algorithm that can calculate at least one subgradient at a given point. Finally, we present an illustrative example that shows the effectiveness of the mechanism.

Abstract: When an old apartment building is demolished and rebuilt, how can we fairly redistribute the new apartments to minimize envy among residents? We reduce this question to a combinatorial optimization problem called the *Min Max Average Cycle Weight* problem. In that problem we seek to assign objects to agents in a way that minimizes the maximum average weight of directed cycles in an associated envy graph. While this problem reduces to maximum-weight matching when starting from a clean slate (achieving polynomial-time solvability), we show that this is not the case when we account for preexisting conditions, such as residents' satisfaction with their original apartments. Whether the problem is polynomial-time solvable in the general case remains an intriguing open problem.

Abstract: Scientific research increasingly relies on specialized computational tools, yet effectively utilizing these tools demands substantial domain expertise. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in tool automation, they struggle to seamlessly integrate and orchestrate multiple tools for complex scientific workflows. Here, we present SciToolAgent, an LLM-powered agent that automates hundreds of scientific tools across biology, chemistry, and materials science. At its core, SciToolAgent leverages a scientific tool knowledge graph that enables intelligent tool selection and execution through graph-based retrieval-augmented generation. The agent also incorporates a comprehensive safety-checking module to ensure responsible and ethical tool usage. Extensive evaluations on a curated benchmark demonstrate that SciToolAgent significantly outperforms existing approaches. Case studies in protein engineering, chemical reactivity prediction, chemical synthesis, and metal-organic framework screening further demonstrate SciToolAgent's capability to automate complex scientific workflows, making advanced research tools accessible to both experts and non-experts.

Abstract: Decentralized multi-agent navigation under uncertainty is a complex task that arises in numerous robotic applications. It requires collision avoidance strategies that account for both kinematic constraints, sensing and action execution noise. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) with a probabilistic adaptation of Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance. Our method ensures safe and efficient multi-agent navigation by incorporating probabilistic safety constraints directly into the MPPI sampling process via a Second-Order Cone Programming formulation. This approach enables agents to operate independently using local noisy observations while maintaining safety guarantees. We validate our algorithm through extensive simulations with differential-drive robots and benchmark it against state-of-the-art methods, including ORCA-DD and B-UAVC. Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms them while achieving high success rates, even in densely populated environments. Additionally, validation in the Gazebo simulator confirms its practical applicability to robotic platforms.

Abstract: Robotic platforms have become essential for marine operations by providing regular and continuous access to offshore assets, such as underwater infrastructure inspection, environmental monitoring, and resource exploration. However, the complex and dynamic nature of underwater environments, characterized by limited visibility, unpredictable currents, and communication constraints, presents significant challenges that demand advanced autonomy while ensuring operator trust and oversight. Central to addressing these challenges are knowledge representation and reasoning techniques, particularly knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, that enable robots to efficiently structure, retrieve, and interpret complex environmental data. These capabilities empower robotic agents to reason, adapt, and respond effectively to changing conditions. The primary goal of this work is to demonstrate both multi-agent autonomy and shared autonomy, where multiple robotic agents operate independently while remaining connected to a human supervisor. We show how a RAG-powered large language model, augmented with knowledge graph data and domain taxonomy, enables autonomous multi-agent decision-making and facilitates seamless human-robot interaction, resulting in 100\% mission validation and behavior completeness. Finally, ablation studies reveal that without structured knowledge from the graph and/or taxonomy, the LLM is prone to hallucinations, which can compromise decision quality.

<title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Mobility Resource Allocation with Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping</title>

Abstract: Allocating mobility resources (e.g., shared bikes/e-scooters, ride-sharing vehicles) is crucial for rebalancing the mobility demand and supply in the urban environments. We propose in this work a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning named Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS) for dynamic mobility resource allocation. HAG-PS aims to address two important research challenges regarding multi-agent reinforcement learning for mobility resource allocation: (1) how to dynamically and adaptively share the mobility resource allocation policy (i.e., how to distribute mobility resources) across agents (i.e., representing the regional coordinators of mobility resources); and (2) how to achieve memory-efficient parameter sharing in an urban-scale setting. To address the above challenges, we have provided following novel designs within HAG-PS. To enable dynamic and adaptive parameter sharing, we have designed a hierarchical approach that consists of global and local information of the mobility resource states (e.g., distribution of mobility resources). We have developed an adaptive agent grouping approach in order to split or merge the groups of agents based on their relative closeness of encoded trajectories (i.e., states, actions, and rewards). We have designed a learnable identity (ID) embeddings to enable agent specialization beyond simple parameter copy. We have performed extensive experimental studies based on real-world NYC bike sharing data (a total of more than 1.2 million trips), and demonstrated the superior performance (e.g., improved bike availability) of HAG-PS compared with other baseline approaches.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable navigation across linguistic contexts.

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) offers the potential to accelerate learning by transferring knowledge across tasks. However, it faces critical challenges such as negative transfer, domain adaptation and inefficiency in selecting solid source policies. These issues often represent critical problems in evolving domains, i.e. game development, where scenarios transform and agents must adapt. The continuous release of new agents is costly and inefficient. In this work we challenge the key issues in TL to improve knowledge transfer, agents performance across tasks and reduce computational costs. The proposed methodology, called FAST - Framework for Adaptive Similarity-based Transfer, leverages visual frames and textual descriptions to create a latent representation of tasks dynamics, that is exploited to estimate similarity between environments. The similarity scores guides our method in choosing candidate policies from which transfer abilities to simplify learning of novel tasks. Experimental results, over multiple racing tracks, demonstrate that FAST achieves competitive final performance compared to learning-from-scratch methods while requiring significantly less training steps. These findings highlight the potential of embedding-driven task similarity estimations.

Abstract: Learning physical interaction skills, such as dancing, handshaking, or sparring, remains a fundamental challenge for agents operating in human environments, particularly when the agent's morphology differs significantly from that of the demonstrator. Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted objectives or morphological similarity, limiting their capacity for generalization. Here, we introduce a framework that enables agents with diverse embodiments to learn wholebbody interaction behaviors directly from human demonstrations. The framework extracts a compact, transferable representation of interaction dynamics, called the Embedded Interaction Graph (EIG), which captures key spatiotemporal relationships between the interacting agents. This graph is then used as an imitation objective to train control policies in physics-based simulations, allowing the agent to generate motions that are both semantically meaningful and physically feasible. We demonstrate BuddyImitation on multiple agents, such as humans, quadrupedal robots with manipulators, or mobile manipulators and various interaction scenarios, including sparring, handshaking, rock-paper-scissors, or dancing. Our results demonstrate a promising path toward coordinated behaviors across morphologically distinct characters via cross embodiment interaction learning.

<title>Security Challenges in AI Agent Deployment: Insights from a Large Scale Public Competition</title>

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute complex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web access. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming (ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across 19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent deployment.

Abstract: We introduce Kimi K2, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model with 32 billion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters. We propose the MuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK-clip technique to address training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of Muon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre-trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero loss spike. During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training process, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a joint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its capabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments.
  Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking models, with strengths in agentic capabilities. Notably, K2 obtains 66.1 on Tau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (En), 65.8 on SWE-Bench Verified, and 47.3 on SWE-Bench Multilingual -- surpassing most open and closed-sourced baselines in non-thinking settings. It also exhibits strong capabilities in coding, mathematics, and reasoning tasks, with a score of 53.7 on LiveCodeBench v6, 49.5 on AIME 2025, 75.1 on GPQA-Diamond, and 27.1 on OJBench, all without extended thinking. These results position Kimi K2 as one of the most capable open-source large language models to date, particularly in software engineering and agentic tasks. We release our base and post-trained model checkpoints to facilitate future research and applications of agentic intelligence.

<title>T2I-Copilot: A Training-Free Multi-Agent Text-to-Image System for Enhanced Prompt Interpretation and Interactive Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20536</link>

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings, denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%. Code will be released at: https://github.com/SHI-Labs/T2I-Copilot.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting player movement in multiplayer games is crucial for achieving use cases such as player-mimicking bot navigation, preemptive bot control, strategy recommendation, and real-time player behavior analytics. However, the complex environments allow for a high degree of navigational freedom, and the interactions and team-play between players require models that make effective use of the available heterogeneous input data. This paper presents a multimodal architecture for predicting future player locations on a dynamic time horizon, using a U-Net-based approach for calculating endpoint location probability heatmaps, conditioned using a multimodal feature encoder. The application of a multi-head attention mechanism for different groups of features allows for communication between agents. In doing so, the architecture makes efficient use of the multimodal game state including image inputs, numerical and categorical features, as well as dynamic game data. Consequently, the presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that rely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot behavior or player anomaly detection.

Abstract: MAPF problem aims to find plans for multiple agents in an environment within a given time, such that the agents do not collide with each other or obstacles. Motivated by the execution and monitoring of these plans, we study Dynamic MAPF (D-MAPF) problem, which allows changes such as agents entering/leaving the environment or obstacles being removed/moved. Considering the requirements of real-world applications in warehouses with the presence of humans, we introduce 1) a general definition for D-MAPF (applicable to variations of D-MAPF), 2) a new framework to solve D-MAPF (utilizing multi-shot computation, and allowing different methods to solve D-MAPF), and 3) a new ASP-based method to solve D-MAPF (combining advantages of replanning and repairing methods, with a novel concept of tunnels to specify where agents can move). We have illustrated the strengths and weaknesses of this method by experimental evaluations, from the perspectives of computational performance and quality of solutions.

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values and the value-based preferences of various stakeholders (their value systems) is key in ethical AI. In value-aware AI systems, decision-making draws upon explicit computational representations of individual values (groundings) and their aggregation into value systems. As these are notoriously difficult to elicit and calibrate manually, value learning approaches aim to automatically derive computational models of an agent's values and value system from demonstrations of human behaviour. Nonetheless, social science and humanities literature suggest that it is more adequate to conceive the value system of a society as a set of value systems of different groups, rather than as the simple aggregation of individual value systems. Accordingly, here we formalize the problem of learning the value systems of societies and propose a method to address it based on heuristic deep clustering. The method learns socially shared value groundings and a set of diverse value systems representing a given society by observing qualitative value-based preferences from a sample of agents. We evaluate the proposal in a use case with real data about travelling decisions.

<title>Dark Side of Modalities: Reinforced Multimodal Distillation for Multimodal Knowledge Graph Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2507.20738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multimodal knowledge graph reasoning (MKGR) task aims to predict the missing facts in the incomplete MKGs by leveraging auxiliary images and descriptions of entities. Existing approaches are trained with single-target objectives, which neglect the probabilistic correlations of entity labels, especially in non-target entities. Moreover, previous studies incorporate all modalities statically or adaptively, overlooking the negative impacts of irrelevant or misleading information in the incompetent modalities. To address these issues, we introduce a novel Reinforced Multimodal Distillation framework, exploiting the Dark Side of Modalities (DSoM) from two perspectives: (1) Dark knowledge from non-target entities: We propose to train a unimodal KGR model through logit distillation to mimic the multimodal soft labels provided by pre-trained multimodal teacher models. The multimodal soft labels could provide rich supervision signals with subtle correlations among both target and non-target entities from multiple perspectives. We further decouple logits into neighbor entities and non-neighbor entities to divide into two types of correlations. (2) Dark side in unhelpful modalities: To exclude the adverse effects of unhelpful modalities, we introduce a reinforced teacher combination mechanism that dynamically selects the optimal set of multimodal teachers for each triple. The agent is trained to maximize the rewards, which are only assigned to the beneficial multimodal combination strategies for the student model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DSoM framework on 5 MKGR datasets. Codes are available at github.com/OreOZhao/DSoM.

Abstract: Accurate and robust localization is critical for the safe operation of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), especially in complex urban environments where Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are unreliable. This paper presents a novel vision-based cooperative localization algorithm that leverages onboard cameras and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to enable CAVs to estimate their poses, even in occlusion-heavy scenarios such as busy intersections. In particular, we propose a novel decentralized observer for a group of connected agents that includes landmark agents (static or moving) in the environment with known positions and vehicle agents that need to estimate their poses (both positions and orientations). Assuming that (i) there are at least three landmark agents in the environment, (ii) each vehicle agent can measure its own angular and translational velocities as well as relative bearings to at least three neighboring landmarks or vehicles, and (iii) neighboring vehicles can communicate their pose estimates, each vehicle can estimate its own pose using the proposed decentralized observer. We prove that the origin of the estimation error is locally exponentially stable under the proposed observer, provided that the minimal observability conditions are satisfied. Moreover, we evaluate the proposed approach through experiments with real 1/10th-scale connected vehicles and large-scale simulations, demonstrating its scalability and validating the theoretical guarantees in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Situationally-aware artificial agents operating with competence in natural environments face several challenges: spatial awareness, object affordance detection, dynamic changes and unpredictability. A critical challenge is the agent's ability to identify and monitor environmental elements pertinent to its objectives. Our research introduces a neurosymbolic modular architecture for reactive robotics. Our system combines a neural component performing object recognition over the environment and image processing techniques such as optical flow, with symbolic representation and reasoning. The reasoning system is grounded in the embodied cognition paradigm, via integrating image schematic knowledge in an ontological structure. The ontology is operatively used to create queries for the perception system, decide on actions, and infer entities' capabilities derived from perceptual data. The combination of reasoning and image processing allows the agent to focus its perception for normal operation as well as discover new concepts for parts of objects involved in particular interactions. The discovered concepts allow the robot to autonomously acquire training data and adjust its subsymbolic perception to recognize the parts, as well as making planning for more complex tasks feasible by focusing search on those relevant object parts. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated world, in which an agent learns to recognize parts of objects involved in support relations. While the agent has no concept of handle initially, by observing examples of supported objects hanging from a hook it learns to recognize the parts involved in establishing support and becomes able to plan the establishment/destruction of the support relation. This underscores the agent's capability to expand its knowledge through observation in a systematic way, and illustrates the potential of combining deep reasoning [...].

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior planning have shown impressive social interaction capabilities when interacting with other road users. However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in interactions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex multi-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on crowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to AVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic boundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed behavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling interactions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a cognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is integrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic interaction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk Social Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused measure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like trajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a dynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a Soft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and informed decisions. Simulation results indicate that our proposed framework effectively improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing autonomous driving, yet their potential is constrained by myopic decision-making and passive perception, limiting reliability in complex environments. We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making. DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models, such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.

<title>Fairness under Equal-Sized Bundles: Impossibility Results and Approximation Guarantees</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods under cardinality constraints, where each agent must receive a bundle of fixed size. This models practical scenarios, such as assigning shifts or forming equally sized teams. Recently, variants of envy-freeness up to one/any item (EF1, EFX) were introduced for this setting, based on flips or exchanges of items. Namely, one can define envy-freeness up to one/any flip (EFF1, EFFX), meaning that an agent $i$ does not envy another agent $j$ after performing one or any one-item flip between their bundles that improves the value of $i$.
  We explore algorithmic aspects of this notion, and our contribution is twofold: we present both algorithmic and impossibility results, highlighting a stark contrast between the classic EFX concept and its flip-based analogue. First, we explore standard techniques used in the literature and show that they fail to guarantee EFFX approximations. On the positive side, we show that we can achieve a constant factor approximation guarantee when agents share a common ranking over item values, based on the well-known envy cycle elimination technique. This idea also leads to a generalized algorithm with approximation guarantees when agents agree on the top $n$ items and their valuation functions are bounded. Finally, we show that an algorithm that maximizes the Nash welfare guarantees a 1/2-EFF1 allocation, and that this bound is tight.

<title>Core Safety Values for Provably Corrigible Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20964</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first implementable framework for corrigibility, with provable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our framework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate* utility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness, low-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility Preservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict weight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step, self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \emph{learned} to mean-squared error $\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\varepsilon$-sub-optimal, the probability of violating \emph{any} safety property is bounded while still ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF, which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience and impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended settings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether an arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by reduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable island'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and verified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs. Consequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage and generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality rather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation guidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.

Abstract: Visualization dashboards are increasingly used in strategic settings like auctions to enhance decision-making and reduce strategic confusion. This paper presents behavioral experiments evaluating how different dashboard designs affect bid optimization in reverse first-price auctions. Additionally, we assess how dashboard designs impact the auction designer's ability to accurately infer bidders' preferences within the dashboard mechanism framework. We compare visualizations of the bid allocation rule, commonly deployed in practice, to alternatives that display expected utility. We find that utility-based visualizations significantly improve bidding by reducing cognitive demands on bidders. However, even with improved dashboards, bidders systematically under-shade their bids, driven by an implicit preference for certain wins in uncertain settings. As a result, dashboard-based mechanisms that assume fully rational or risk-neutral bidder responses to dashboards can produce significant estimation errors when inferring private preferences, which may lead to suboptimal allocations in practice. Explicitly modeling agents' behavioral responses to dashboards substantially improves inference accuracy, highlighting the need to align visualization design and econometric inference assumptions in practice.

<title>MIRAGE-Bench: LLM Agent is Hallucinating and Where to Find Them</title>

Abstract: Hallucinations pose critical risks for large language model (LLM)-based agents, often manifesting as hallucinative actions resulting from fabricated or misinterpreted information within the cognitive context. While recent studies have exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a principled testbed. In this paper, we present MIRAGE-Bench--Measuring Illusions in Risky AGEnt settings--the first unified benchmark for eliciting and evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by introducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions that are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii) environment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by performing a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize test cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in deterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we adopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware prompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without enumerating full action spaces. MIRAGE-Bench provides actionable insights on failure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.

arXiv:2507.21028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly all human work is collaborative; thus, the evaluation of real-world NLP applications often requires multiple dimensions that align with diverse human perspectives. As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and costly, the emerging "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm sheds light on a promising approach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet, to date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona descriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are not generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose MAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically construct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant text documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the personas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate multi-dimensional feedback. Our evaluation experiments in both the educational and medical domains demonstrate that MAJ-EVAL can generate evaluation results that better align with human experts' ratings compared with conventional automated evaluation metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.21035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the complexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive domain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry. GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack, thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the idiosyncrasies of genomic data.
  On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85% respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting for latent confounders.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks, evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g., models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages (e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards, textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents, highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare, and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety, scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously, performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.

Abstract: Brownian motion have long been studied on a diversity of fields, not only in physics of statistical mechanics, but also in biological models, finance and economic process, and social systems. In the past twenty years, there has been a growing interest in studying the model in self-propelled feature and interaction force such that the model also fits into study of social phenomenon of many individuals. This article will continue with this research trend and especially investigate the model in paradigms for a quantitative description of social and economic process. We mainly discuss a class of collective decision process of Brownian agent/particles, where the stochastic process does not exist in the fluctuation in the traditional Brownian motion, but in selection among several discrete choices. Their decisions interacts with each other in a given social topology. To simplify our discussion the binary choice problem is particularly discussed where each agent only takes an alternative of two choices. Mathematically, we introduce a set of arrays to describe social relationship of agents in a quantitative manner, and the arrays deduce the group social force and opinion dynamics, which are useful to study complex social movement and self-organization phenomena including discrete-choice activities, social groups and de-individualization effect. Such agent-based simulation symbolizes a variety of collective activities in human society, especially in the field of economics and social science.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical frameworks leverage quantum computing for machine learning; however, variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are limited by the need for local measurements. We introduce an adaptive non-local observable (ANO) paradigm within VQCs for quantum reinforcement learning (QRL), jointly optimizing circuit parameters and multi-qubit measurements. The ANO-VQC architecture serves as the function approximator in Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms. On multiple benchmark tasks, ANO-VQC agents outperform baseline VQCs. Ablation studies reveal that adaptive measurements enhance the function space without increasing circuit depth. Our results demonstrate that adaptive multi-qubit observables can enable practical quantum advantages in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) provide a powerful framework to describe complex systems composed of interacting entities, capable of producing emergent collective behaviours such as consensus formation or clustering. However, the increasing dimensionality of these models -- in terms of both the number of agents and the size of their state space -- poses significant computational challenges, particularly in the context of optimal control. In this work, we propose a scalable control frame work for large-scale ABMs based on a twofold model order reduction strategy: agent clustering and projection-based reduction via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). These techniques are integrated into a feedback loop that enables the design and application of optimal control laws over a reduced-order representation of the system. To illustrate the effectiveness of the approach, we consider the opinion dynamics model, a prototyp ical first-order ABM where agents interact through state-dependent influence functions. We show that our method significantly improves control efficiency, even in scenarios where direct control fails due to model complexity. Beyond its methodological contributions, this work also highlights the rel evance of opinion dynamics models in environmental contexts -- for example, modeling the diffusion of pro-environmental attitudes or decision-making processes in sustainable policy adoption -- where controlling consensus formation plays a crucial role.

Abstract: We develop an operator algebraic framework for infinite games with a continuum of agents and prove that regret based learning dynamics governed by a noncommutative continuity equation converge to a unique quantal response equilibrium under mild regularity assumptions. The framework unifies functional analysis, coarse geometry and game theory by assigning to every game a von Neumann algebra that represents collective strategy evolution. A reflective regret operator within this algebra drives the flow of strategy distributions and its fixed point characterises equilibrium. We introduce the ordinal folding index, a computable ordinal valued metric that measures the self referential depth of the dynamics, and show that it bounds the transfinite time needed for convergence, collapsing to zero on coarsely amenable networks. The theory yields new invariant subalgebra rigidity results, establishes existence and uniqueness of envy free and maximin share allocations in continuum economies, and links analytic properties of regret flows with empirical stability phenomena in large language models. These contributions supply a rigorous mathematical foundation for large scale multi agent systems and demonstrate the utility of ordinal metrics for equilibrium selection.

Abstract: Understanding the intrinsic mechanisms of social platforms is an urgent demand to maintain social stability. The rise of large language models provides significant potential for social network simulations to capture attitude dynamics and reproduce collective behaviors. However, existing studies mainly focus on scaling up agent populations, neglecting the dynamic evolution of social relationships. To address this gap, we introduce DynamiX, a novel large-scale social network simulator dedicated to dynamic social network modeling. DynamiX uses a dynamic hierarchy module for selecting core agents with key characteristics at each timestep, enabling accurate alignment of real-world adaptive switching of user roles. Furthermore, we design distinct dynamic social relationship modeling strategies for different user types. For opinion leaders, we propose an information-stream-based link prediction method recommending potential users with similar stances, simulating homogeneous connections, and autonomous behavior decisions. For ordinary users, we construct an inequality-oriented behavior decision-making module, effectively addressing unequal social interactions and capturing the patterns of relationship adjustments driven by multi-dimensional factors. Experimental results demonstrate that DynamiX exhibits marked improvements in attitude evolution simulation and collective behavior analysis compared to static networks. Besides, DynamiX opens a new theoretical perspective on follower growth prediction, providing empirical evidence for opinion leaders cultivation.

Abstract: The rapid growth of crypto markets has opened new opportunities for investors, but at the same time exposed them to high volatility. To address the challenge of managing dynamic portfolios in such an environment, this paper presents a practical application of a multi-agent system designed to autonomously construct and evaluate crypto-asset allocations. Using data on daily frequencies of the ten most capitalized cryptocurrencies from 2020 to 2025, we compare two automated investment strategies. These are a static equal weighting strategy and a rolling-window optimization strategy, both implemented to maximize the evaluation metrics of the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), such as Expected Return, Sharpe and Sortino ratios, while minimizing volatility. Each step of the process is handled by dedicated agents, integrated through a collaborative architecture in Crew AI. The results show that the dynamic optimization strategy achieves significantly better performance in terms of risk-adjusted returns, both in-sample and out-of-sample. This highlights the benefits of adaptive techniques in portfolio management, particularly in volatile markets such as cryptocurrency markets. The following methodology proposed also demonstrates how multi-agent systems can provide scalable, auditable, and flexible solutions in financial automation.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency trading is a challenging task requiring the integration of heterogeneous data from multiple modalities. Traditional deep learning and reinforcement learning approaches typically demand large training datasets and encode diverse inputs into numerical representations, often at the cost of interpretability. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents has demonstrated the capacity to process multi-modal data and support complex investment decision-making. Building on these advances, we present \textbf{MountainLion}, a multi-modal, multi-agent system for financial trading that coordinates specialized LLM-based agents to interpret financial data and generate investment strategies. MountainLion processes textual news, candlestick charts, and trading signal charts to produce high-quality financial reports, while also enabling modification of reports and investment recommendations through data-driven user interaction and question answering. A central reflection module analyzes historical trading signals and outcomes to continuously refine decision processes, and the system is capable of real-time report analysis, summarization, and dynamic adjustment of investment strategies. Empirical results confirm that MountainLion systematically enriches technical price triggers with contextual macroeconomic and capital flow signals, providing a more interpretable, robust, and actionable investment framework that improves returns and strengthens investor confidence.

<title>Aligning Large Language Model Agents with Rational and Moral Preferences: A Supervised Fine-Tuning Approach</title>

Abstract: Understanding how large language model (LLM) agents behave in strategic interactions is essential as these systems increasingly participate autonomously in economically and morally consequential decisions. We evaluate LLM preferences using canonical economic games, finding substantial deviations from human behavior. Models like GPT-4o show excessive cooperation and limited incentive sensitivity, while reasoning models, such as o3-mini, align more consistently with payoff-maximizing strategies. We propose a supervised fine-tuning pipeline that uses synthetic datasets derived from economic reasoning to align LLM agents with economic preferences, focusing on two stylized preference structures. In the first, utility depends only on individual payoffs (homo economicus), while utility also depends on a notion of Kantian universalizability in the second preference structure (homo moralis). We find that fine-tuning based on small datasets shifts LLM agent behavior toward the corresponding economic agent. We further assess the fine-tuned agents' behavior in two applications: Moral dilemmas involving autonomous vehicles and algorithmic pricing in competitive markets. These examples illustrate how different normative objectives embedded via realizations from structured preference structures can influence market and moral outcomes. This work contributes a replicable, cost-efficient, and economically grounded pipeline to align AI preferences using moral-economic principles.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework to extract the algebra of the transformations of worlds from the perspective of an agent. As a starting point, we use our framework to reproduce the symmetry-based representations from the symmetry-based disentangled representation learning (SBDRL) formalism proposed by [1]; only the algebra of transformations of worlds that form groups can be described using symmetry-based representations. We then study the algebras of the transformations of worlds with features that occur in simple reinforcement learning scenarios. Using computational methods, that we developed, we extract the algebras of the transformations of these worlds and classify them according to their properties. Finally, we generalise two important results of SBDRL - the equivariance condition and the disentangling definition - from only working with symmetry-based representations to working with representations capturing the transformation properties of worlds with transformations for any algebra. Finally, we combine our generalised equivariance condition and our generalised disentangling definition to show that disentangled sub-algebras can each have their own individual equivariance conditions, which can be treated independently.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems often require agents to collaborate with or compete against other agents with diverse goals, behaviors, or strategies. Agent modeling is essential when designing adaptive policies for intelligent machine agents in multiagent systems, as this is the means by which the ego agent understands other agents' behavior and extracts their meaningful policy representations. These representations can be used to enhance the ego agent's adaptive policy which is trained by reinforcement learning. However, existing agent modeling approaches typically assume the availability of local observations from other agents (modeled agents) during training or a long observation trajectory for policy adaption. To remove these constrictive assumptions and improve agent modeling performance, we devised a Contrastive Learning-based Agent Modeling (CLAM) method that relies only on the local observations from the ego agent during training and execution. With these observations, CLAM is capable of generating consistent high-quality policy representations in real-time right from the beginning of each episode. We evaluated the efficacy of our approach in both cooperative and competitive multi-agent environments. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art on both cooperative and competitive tasks, highlighting the potential of contrastive learning-based agent modeling for enhancing reinforcement learning.

Abstract: This manuscript considers the problem of ensuring stability and safety during formation control with distributed multi-agent systems in the presence of parametric uncertainty in the dynamics and limited communication. We propose an integrative approach that combines Adaptive Control, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), and connected graphs. The main elements employed in the integrative approach are an adaptive control design that ensures stability, a CBF-based safety filter that generates safe commands based on a reference model dynamics, and a reference model that ensures formation control with multi-agent systems when no uncertainties are present. The overall control design is shown to lead to a closed-loop adaptive system that is stable, avoids unsafe regions, and converges to a desired formation of the multi-agents. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical derivations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), optimized through human feedback, have rapidly emerged as a leading paradigm for developing intelligent conversational assistants. However, despite their strong performance across many benchmarks, LLM-based agents might still lack conversational skills such as disambiguation -- when they are faced with ambiguity, they often overhedge or implicitly guess users' true intents rather than asking clarification questions. Under task-specific settings, high-quality conversation samples are often limited, constituting a bottleneck for LLMs' ability to learn optimal dialogue action policies. We propose Action-Based Contrastive Self-Training (ACT), a quasi-online preference optimization algorithm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), that enables data-efficient dialogue policy learning in multi-turn conversation modeling. We demonstrate ACT's efficacy under in data-efficient tuning scenarios, even when there is no action label available, using multiple real-world conversational tasks: tabular-grounded question-answering, machine reading comprehension, and AmbigSQL, a novel task for disambiguating information-seeking requests for complex SQL generation towards data analysis agents. Additionally, we propose evaluating LLMs' ability to function as conversational agents by examining whether they can implicitly recognize and reason about ambiguity in conversation. ACT demonstrates substantial conversation modeling improvements over standard tuning approaches like supervised fine-tuning and DPO.

Abstract: This paper presents LLM2TEA, a Large Language Model (LLM) driven MultiTask Evolutionary Algorithm, representing the first agentic AI designer of its kind operating with generative evolutionary multitasking (GEM). LLM2TEA enables the crossbreeding of solutions from multiple domains, fostering novel solutions that transcend disciplinary boundaries. Of particular interest is the ability to discover designs that are both novel and conforming to real-world physical specifications. LLM2TEA comprises an LLM to generate genotype samples from text prompts describing target objects, a text-to-3D generative model to produce corresponding phenotypes, a classifier to interpret its semantic representations, and a computational simulator to assess its physical properties. Novel LLM-based multitask evolutionary operators are introduced to guide the search towards high-performing, practically viable designs. Experimental results in conceptual design optimization validate the effectiveness of LLM2TEA, showing 97% to 174% improvements in the diversity of novel designs over the current text-to-3D baseline. Moreover, over 73% of the generated designs outperform the top 1% of designs produced by the text-to-3D baseline in terms of physical performance. The designs produced by LLM2TEA are not only aesthetically creative but also functional in real-world contexts. Several of these designs have been successfully 3D printed, demonstrating the ability of our approach to transform AI-generated outputs into tangible, physical designs. These designs underscore the potential of LLM2TEA as a powerful tool for complex design optimization and discovery, capable of producing novel and physically viable designs.

Abstract: Interest in reinforcement learning (RL) for massive-scale systems consisting of large populations of intelligent agents interacting with heterogeneous environments has witnessed a significant surge in recent years across diverse scientific domains. However, the large-scale nature of these systems often results in high computational costs or compromised performance for most state-of-the-art RL techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL architecture along with the derivation of effective algorithms to learn optimal policies for arbitrarily large systems of agents. In our formulation, we model such a system as a parameterized control system defined on an infinite-dimensional function space. We then develop a moment kernel transform to map the parameterized system and the value function into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This transformation generates a sequence of finite-dimensional moment representations for the RL problem, which are organized into a filtrated structure. Leveraging this RL filtration, we develop a hierarchical algorithm for learning optimal policies for the infinite-dimensional parameterized system. We further enhance the efficiency of the algorithm by exploiting early stopping at each hierarchy, which demonstrates the fast convergence property of the algorithm through the construction of a convergent spectral sequence. The performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are validated using practical examples.

Abstract: Mean field type games (MFTGs) describe Nash equilibria between large coalitions: each coalition consists of a continuum of cooperative agents who maximize the average reward of their coalition while interacting non-cooperatively with a finite number of other coalitions. Although the theory has been extensively developed, we are still lacking efficient and scalable computational methods. Here, we develop reinforcement learning methods for such games in a finite space setting with general dynamics and reward functions. We start by proving that the MFTG solution yields approximate Nash equilibria in finite-size coalition games. We then propose two algorithms. The first is based on the quantization of mean-field spaces and Nash Q-learning. We provide convergence and stability analysis. We then propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which can scale to larger spaces. Numerical experiments in 4 environments with mean-field distributions of dimension up to $200$ show the scalability and efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: Integrating multiple (sub-)systems is essential to create advanced Information Systems (ISs). Difficulties mainly arise when integrating dynamic environments across the IS lifecycle. A traditional approach is a registry that provides the API documentation of the systems' endpoints. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be capable of automatically creating system integrations (e.g., as service composition) based on this documentation but require concise input due to input token limitations, especially regarding comprehensive API descriptions. Currently, it is unknown how best to preprocess these API descriptions. Within this work, we (i) analyze the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for endpoint discovery and the chunking, i.e., preprocessing, of OpenAPIs to reduce the input token length while preserving the most relevant information. To further reduce the input token length for the composition prompt and improve endpoint retrieval, we propose (ii) a Discovery Agent that only receives a summary of the most relevant endpoints and retrieves details on demand. We evaluate RAG for endpoint discovery using the RestBench benchmark, first, for the different chunking possibilities and parameters measuring the endpoint retrieval recall, precision, and F1 score. Then, we assess the Discovery Agent using the same test set. With our prototype, we demonstrate how to successfully employ RAG for endpoint discovery to reduce the token count. While revealing high values for recall, precision, and F1, further research is necessary to retrieve all requisite endpoints. Our experiments show that for preprocessing, LLM-based and format-specific approaches outperform na\"ive chunking methods. Relying on an agent further enhances these results as the agent splits the tasks into multiple fine granular subtasks, improving the overall RAG performance in the token count, precision, and F1 score.

Abstract: Conversational agents are increasingly woven into individuals' personal lives, yet users often underestimate the privacy risks associated with them. The moment users share information with these agents-such as large language models (LLMs)-their private information becomes vulnerable to exposure. In this paper, we characterize the notion of contextual privacy for user interactions with LLM-based Conversational Agents (LCAs). It aims to minimize privacy risks by ensuring that users (sender) disclose only information that is both relevant and necessary for achieving their intended goals when interacting with LCAs (untrusted receivers). Through a formative design user study, we observe how even "privacy-conscious" users inadvertently reveal sensitive information through indirect disclosures. Based on insights from this study, we propose a locally deployable framework that operates between users and LCAs, identifying and reformulating out-of-context information in user prompts. Our evaluation using examples from ShareGPT shows that lightweight models can effectively implement this framework, achieving strong gains in contextual privacy while preserving the user's intended interaction goals. Notably, about 76% of participants in our human evaluation preferred the reformulated prompts over the original ones, validating the usability and effectiveness of contextual privacy in our proposed framework. We opensource the code at https://github.com/IBM/contextual-privacy-LLM.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in open-ended dialogue, yet their inability to retain and retrieve relevant information from long-term interactions limits their effectiveness in applications requiring sustained personalization. External memory mechanisms have been proposed to address this limitation, enabling LLMs to maintain conversational continuity. However, existing approaches struggle with two key challenges. First, rigid memory granularity fails to capture the natural semantic structure of conversations, leading to fragmented and incomplete representations. Second, fixed retrieval mechanisms cannot adapt to diverse dialogue contexts and user interaction patterns. In this work, we propose Reflective Memory Management (RMM), a novel mechanism for long-term dialogue agents, integrating forward- and backward-looking reflections: (1) Prospective Reflection, which dynamically summarizes interactions across granularities-utterances, turns, and sessions-into a personalized memory bank for effective future retrieval, and (2) Retrospective Reflection, which iteratively refines the retrieval in an online reinforcement learning (RL) manner based on LLMs' cited evidence. Experiments show that RMM demonstrates consistent improvement across various metrics and benchmarks. For example, RMM shows more than 10% accuracy improvement over the baseline without memory management on the LongMemEval dataset.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving research currently faces a critical challenge in bridging the gap between open-loop training and closed-loop deployment. Current approaches are trained to predict trajectories in an open-loop environment, which struggle with quick reactions to other agents in closed-loop environments and risk generating kinematically infeasible plans due to the gap between open-loop training and closed-loop driving. In this paper, we introduce Hydra-NeXt, a novel multi-branch planning framework that unifies trajectory prediction, control prediction, and a trajectory refinement network in one model. Unlike current open-loop trajectory prediction models that only handle general-case planning, Hydra-NeXt further utilizes a control decoder to focus on short-term actions, which enables faster responses to dynamic situations and reactive agents. Moreover, we propose the Trajectory Refinement module to augment and refine the planning decisions by effectively adhering to kinematic constraints in closed-loop environments. This unified approach bridges the gap between open-loop training and closed-loop driving, demonstrating superior performance of 65.89 Driving Score (DS) and 48.20% Success Rate (SR) on the Bench2Drive dataset without relying on external experts for data collection. Hydra-NeXt surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 22.98 DS and 17.49 SR, marking a significant advancement in autonomous driving. Code will be available at https://github.com/woxihuanjiangguo/Hydra-NeXt.

Abstract: Traffic congestion remains a significant challenge in modern urban networks. Autonomous driving technologies have emerged as a potential solution. Among traffic control methods, reinforcement learning has shown superior performance over traffic signals in various scenarios. However, prior research has largely focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections, leaving large-scale mixed traffic control largely unexplored. This study presents the first attempt to use decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning for large-scale mixed traffic control in which some intersections are managed by traffic signals and others by robot vehicles. Evaluating a real-world network in Colorado Springs, CO, USA with 14 intersections, we measure traffic efficiency via average waiting time of vehicles at intersections and the number of vehicles reaching their destinations within a time window (i.e., throughput). At 80% RV penetration rate, our method reduces waiting time from 6.17s to 5.09s and increases throughput from 454 vehicles per 500 seconds to 493 vehicles per 500 seconds, outperforming the baseline of fully signalized intersections. These findings suggest that integrating reinforcement learning-based control large-scale traffic can improve overall efficiency and may inform future urban planning strategies.

<title>Real-Time LaCAM for Real-Time MAPF</title>

Abstract: The vast majority of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) methods with completeness guarantees require planning full-horizon paths. However, planning full-horizon paths can take too long and be impractical in real-world applications. Instead, real-time planning and execution, which only allows the planner a finite amount of time before executing and replanning, is more practical for real-world multi-agent systems. Several methods utilize real-time planning schemes but none are provably complete, which leads to livelock or deadlock. Our main contribution is Real-Time LaCAM, the first Real-Time MAPF method with provable completeness guarantees. We do this by leveraging LaCAM (Okumura 2023) in an incremental fashion. Our results show how we can iteratively plan for congested environments with a cutoff time of milliseconds while still maintaining the same success rate as full-horizon LaCAM. We also show how it can be used with a single-step learned MAPF policy.

<title>Adopting Large Language Models to Automated System Integration</title>

Abstract: Modern enterprise computing systems integrate numerous subsystems to resolve a common task by yielding emergent behavior. A widespread approach is using services implemented with Web technologies like REST or OpenAPI, which offer an interaction mechanism and service documentation standard, respectively. Each service represents a specific business functionality, allowing encapsulation and easier maintenance. Despite the reduced maintenance costs on an individual service level, increased integration complexity arises. Consequently, automated service composition approaches have arisen to mitigate this issue. Nevertheless, these approaches have not achieved high acceptance in practice due to their reliance on complex formal modeling. Within this Ph.D. thesis, we analyze the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically integrate the services based on a natural language input. The result is a reusable service composition, e.g., as program code. While not always generating entirely correct results, the result can still be helpful by providing integration engineers with a close approximation of a suitable solution, which requires little effort to become operational. Our research involves (i) introducing a software architecture for automated service composition using LLMs, (ii) analyzing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for service discovery, (iii) proposing a novel natural language query-based benchmark for service discovery, and (iv) extending the benchmark to complete service composition scenarios. We have presented our software architecture as Compositio Prompto, the analysis of RAG for service discovery, and submitted a proposal for the service discovery benchmark. Open topics are primarily the extension of the service discovery benchmark to service composition scenarios and the improvements of the service composition generation, e.g., using fine-tuning or LLM agents.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models has redefined the agent paradigm by integrating language and vision modalities with external data sources, enabling agents to better interpret human instructions and execute increasingly complex tasks. However, in this paper, we identify a critical yet previously overlooked security vulnerability in multimodal agents: cross-modal prompt injection attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose CrossInject, a novel attack framework in which attackers embed adversarial perturbations across multiple modalities to align with target malicious content, allowing external instructions to hijack the agent's decision-making process and execute unauthorized tasks. Our approach incorporates two key coordinated components. First, we introduce Visual Latent Alignment, where we optimize adversarial features to the malicious instructions in the visual embedding space based on a text-to-image generative model, ensuring that adversarial images subtly encode cues for malicious task execution. Subsequently, we present Textual Guidance Enhancement, where a large language model is leveraged to construct the black-box defensive system prompt through adversarial meta prompting and generate an malicious textual command that steers the agent's output toward better compliance with attackers' requests. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art attacks, achieving at least a +30.1% increase in attack success rates across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we validate our attack's effectiveness in real-world multimodal autonomous agents, highlighting its potential implications for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: There are numerous frameworks capable of creating and orchestrating agents to address complex tasks. However, most of them highly coupled Python programming with agent declaration, making it hard for maintenance and runtime optimization. In this work, we introduce ADL, an agent declarative language for customer service chatbots. ADL abstracts away implementation details, offering a declarative way to define agents and their interactions, which could ease maintenance and debugging. It also incorporates natural language programming at its core to simplify the specification and communication of chatbot designs. ADL includes four basic types of agents and supports integration with custom functions, tool use, and third-party agents. MICA, a multi-agent system designed to interpret and execute ADL programs, has been developed and is now available as an open-source project at https://github.com/Mica-labs/MICA. Its documentation can be found at https://mica-labs.github.io/.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and social deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.

<title>Surrogate modeling of Cellular-Potts Agent-Based Models as a segmentation task using the U-Net neural network architecture</title>

Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM previously used to investigate in vitro vasculogenesis. The surrogate model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps, MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater spatial and temporal scales.

<title>AutoLibra: Agent Metric Induction from Open-Ended Feedback</title>

Abstract: Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics, which are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward intermediate emergent behaviors. We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback e.g. "If you find that the button is disabled, don't click it again", or "This agent has too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own" into metrics for evaluating fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as evaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: "coverage" and "redundancy". Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent improvement: First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better prompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text game tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%. Second, we show that AutoLibra can iteratively select high-quality fine-tuning data for web navigation agents. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.

Abstract: Motion prediction, the anticipation of future agent states or scene evolution, is rooted in human cognition, bridging perception and decision-making. It enables intelligent systems, such as robots and self-driving cars, to act safely in dynamic, human-involved environments, and informs broader time-series reasoning challenges. With advances in methods, representations, and datasets, the field has seen rapid progress, reflected in quickly evolving benchmark results. Yet, when state-of-the-art methods are deployed in the real world, they often struggle to generalize to open-world conditions and fall short of deployment standards. This reveals a gap between research benchmarks, which are often idealized or ill-posed, and real-world complexity.
  To address this gap, this survey revisits the generalization and deployability of motion prediction models, with an emphasis on the applications of robotics, autonomous driving, and human motion. We first offer a comprehensive taxonomy of motion prediction methods, covering representations, modeling strategies, application domains, and evaluation protocols. We then study two key challenges: (1) how to push motion prediction models to be deployable to realistic deployment standards, where motion prediction does not act in a vacuum, but functions as one module of closed-loop autonomy stacks - it takes input from the localization and perception, and informs downstream planning and control. 2) how to generalize motion prediction models from limited seen scenarios/datasets to the open-world settings. Throughout the paper, we highlight critical open challenges to guide future work, aiming to recalibrate the community's efforts, fostering progress that is not only measurable but also meaningful for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated with autonomous agents hold significant potential for advancing scientific discovery through automated reasoning and task execution. However, applying LLM agents to drug discovery is still constrained by challenges such as large-scale multimodal data processing, limited task automation, and poor support for domain-specific tools. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DrugPilot, a LLM-based agent system with a parameterized reasoning architecture designed for end-to-end scientific workflows in drug discovery. DrugPilot enables multi-stage research processes by integrating structured tool use with a novel parameterized memory pool. The memory pool converts heterogeneous data from both public sources and user-defined inputs into standardized representations. This design supports efficient multi-turn dialogue, reduces information loss during data exchange, and enhances complex scientific decision-making. To support training and benchmarking, we construct a drug instruction dataset covering eight core drug discovery tasks. Under the Berkeley function-calling benchmark, DrugPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agents such as ReAct and LoT, achieving task completion rates of 98.0%, 93.5%, and 64.0% for simple, multi-tool, and multi-turn scenarios, respectively. These results highlight DrugPilot's potential as a versatile agent framework for computational science domains requiring automated, interactive, and data-integrated reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI (GenAI) systems, such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, and Copilot (by OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, respectively), are reshaping digital platforms and app ecosystems while introducing critical challenges in cybersecurity, privacy, and platform integrity. Our analysis reveals alarming trends: LLM-assisted malware is projected to rise from 2% (2021) to 50% (2025); AI-generated Google reviews grew nearly tenfold (1.2% in 2021 to 12.21% in 2023, expected to reach 30% by 2025); AI scam reports surged 456%; misinformation sites increased over 1500%; and deepfake attacks are projected to rise over 900% in 2025. In finance, LLM-driven threats like synthetic identity fraud and AI-generated scams are accelerating. Platforms such as JPMorgan Chase, Stripe, and Plaid deploy LLMs for fraud detection, regulation parsing, and KYC/AML automation, reducing fraud loss by up to 21% and accelerating onboarding by 40-60%. LLM-facilitated code development has driven mobile app submissions from 1.8 million (2020) to 3.0 million (2024), projected to reach 3.6 million (2025). To address AI threats, platforms like Google Play, Apple App Store, GitHub Copilot, TikTok, Facebook, and Amazon deploy LLM-based defenses, highlighting their dual nature as both threat sources and mitigation tools. In clinical diagnostics, LLMs raise concerns about accuracy, bias, and safety, necessitating strong governance. Drawing on 445 references, this paper surveys LLM/GenAI and proposes a strategic roadmap and operational blueprint integrating policy auditing (such as CCPA and GDPR compliance), fraud detection, and demonstrates an advanced LLM-DA stack with modular components, multi-LLM routing, agentic memory, and governance layers. We provide actionable insights, best practices, and real-world case studies for scalable trust and responsible innovation.

Abstract: Autonomy is a double-edged sword for AI agents, simultaneously unlocking transformative possibilities and serious risks. How can agent developers calibrate the appropriate levels of autonomy at which their agents should operate? We argue that an agent's level of autonomy can be treated as a deliberate design decision, separate from its capability and operational environment. In this work, we define five levels of escalating agent autonomy, characterized by the roles a user can take when interacting with an agent: operator, collaborator, consultant, approver, and observer. Within each level, we describe the ways by which a user can exert control over the agent and open questions for how to design the nature of user-agent interaction. We then highlight a potential application of our framework towards AI autonomy certificates to govern agent behavior in single- and multi-agent systems. We conclude by proposing early ideas for evaluating agents' autonomy. Our work aims to contribute meaningful, practical steps towards responsibly deployed and useful AI agents in the real world.

Abstract: We consider the problem of safe control in discrete autonomous agents that use learned components for imperfect perception (or more generally, state estimation) from high-dimensional observations. We propose a shield construction that provides run-time safety guarantees under perception errors by restricting the actions available to an agent, modeled as a Markov decision process, as a function of the state estimates. Our construction uses conformal prediction for the perception component, which guarantees that for each observation, the predicted set of estimates includes the actual state with a user-specified probability. The shield allows an action only if it is allowed for all the estimates in the predicted set, resulting in local safety. We also articulate and prove a global safety property of existing shield constructions for perfect-perception agents bounding the probability of reaching unsafe states if the agent always chooses actions prescribed by the shield. We illustrate our approach with a case-study of an experimental autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional perception DNNs.

Abstract: Query rewriting is pivotal for enhancing dense retrieval, yet current methods demand large-scale supervised data or suffer from inefficient reinforcement learning (RL) exploration. In this work, we first establish that guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as semantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus, and SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive Generation Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL framework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative learning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent behavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary exploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without sacrificing performance. Our findings demonstrate that strategy-guided RL, enhanced with nuanced reward shaping, offers a scalable, efficient, and more interpretable paradigm for developing the next generation of robust information retrieval systems.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into social science experiments represents a transformative approach to understanding human-AI interactions and their societal impacts. We introduce Epitome, the world's first open experimental platform dedicated to the deep integration of artificial intelligence and social science. Rooted in theoretical foundations from management, communication studies, sociology, psychology, and ethics, Epitome focuses on the interactive impacts of AI on individuals, organizations, and society during its real-world deployment. It constructs a theoretical support system through cross-disciplinary experiments. The platform offers a one-stop comprehensive experimental solution spanning "foundation models-complex application development-user feedback" through seven core modules, while embedding the classical "control-comparison-comparative causal logic" of social science experiments into multilevel human-computer interaction environments, including dialogues, group chats, and multi-agent virtual scenarios. With its canvas-style, user-friendly interface, Epitome enables researchers to easily design and run complex experimental scenarios, facilitating systematic investigations into the social impacts of AI and exploration of integrated solutions.To demonstrate its capabilities, we replicated three seminal social science experiments involving LLMs, showcasing Epitome's potential to streamline complex experimental designs and produce robust results, suitable for publishing in the top selective journals. Our findings highlight the platform's utility in enhancing the efficiency and quality of human-AI interactions, providing valuable insights into the societal implications of AI technologies. Epitome thus offers a powerful tool for advancing interdisciplinary research at the intersection of AI and social science, with potential applications in policy-making, ...

Abstract: We study stochastic Nash equilibrium problems subject to heterogeneous uncertainty on the expected valued cost functions of the individual agents, where we assume no prior knowledge of the underlying probability distributions of the uncertain variables. To account for this lack of knowledge, we consider an ambiguity set around the empirical probability distribution under the Wasserstein metric. We then show that, under mild assumptions, finite-sample guarantees on the probability that any resulting distributionally robust Nash equilibrium is also robust with respect to the true probability distributions with high confidence can be obtained. Furthermore, by recasting the game as a distributionally robust variational inequality, we establish asymptotic consistency of the set of data-driven distributionally robust equilibria to the solution set of the original game. Finally, we recast the distributionally robust Nash game as a finite-dimensional Nash equilibrium problem. We illustrate the proposed distributionally robust reformulation via numerical experiments of stochastic peer-to-peer electricity markets and Nash-Cournot games.

arXiv:2503.16123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a distributed learning problem in which $n$ agents, each with potentially heterogeneous local data, collaboratively minimize the sum of their local cost functions via peer-to-peer communication. We propose a novel algorithm, \emph{Spanning Tree Push-Pull} (STPP), which employs two spanning trees extracted from a general communication graph to distribute both model parameters and stochastic gradients. Unlike prior approaches that rely heavily on spectral gap properties, STPP leverages a more flexible topological characterization, enabling robust information flow and efficient updates. Theoretically, we prove that STPP achieves linear speedup and polynomial transient iteration complexity -- up to $\mathcal{O}(n^7)$ for smooth nonconvex objectives and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^3)$ for smooth strongly convex objectives -- under arbitrary network topologies. Moreover, compared with existing methods, STPP achieves faster convergence rates on sparse and non-regular topologies (e.g., directed rings) and reduces communication overhead on dense networks (e.g., static exponential graphs). Numerical experiments further demonstrate the strong performance of STPP across various graph architectures.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease. Early and precise diagnosis of AD is crucial for timely intervention and treatment planning to alleviate the progressive neurodegeneration. However, most existing methods rely on single-modality data, which contrasts with the multifaceted approach used by medical experts. While some deep learning approaches process multi-modal data, they are limited to specific tasks with a small set of input modalities and cannot handle arbitrary combinations. This highlights the need for a system that can address diverse AD-related tasks, process multi-modal or missing input, and integrate multiple advanced methods for improved performance. In this paper, we propose ADAgent, the first specialized AI agent for AD analysis, built on a large language model (LLM) to address user queries and support decision-making. ADAgent integrates a reasoning engine, specialized medical tools, and a collaborative outcome coordinator to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis and prognosis tasks in AD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADAgent outperforms SOTA methods, achieving significant improvements in accuracy, including a 2.7% increase in multi-modal diagnosis, a 0.7% improvement in multi-modal prognosis, and enhancements in MRI and PET diagnosis tasks.

Abstract: This thesis presents the results of a comprehensive research project focused on applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the problem of market making in financial markets. Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing liquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk, competition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL, particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop autonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.
  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning problem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and multi-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then addresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary approaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the latter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing objectives.
  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS, a novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This method allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies, enabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.
  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches significantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across various performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new methodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive market making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic trading in complex financial systems.

<title>An Explainable Equity-Aware P2P Energy Trading Framework for Socio-Economically Diverse Microgrid</title>

Abstract: Fair and dynamic energy allocation in community microgrids remains a critical challenge, particularly when serving socio-economically diverse participants. Static optimization and cost-sharing methods often fail to adapt to evolving inequities, leading to participant dissatisfaction and unsustainable cooperation. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), cooperative game theory, and a dynamic equity-adjustment mechanism driven by reinforcement learning (RL). At its core, the framework utilizes a bi-level optimization model grounded in Equity-regarding Welfare Maximization (EqWM) principles, which incorporate Rawlsian fairness to prioritize the welfare of the least advantaged participants. We introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that dynamically adjusts socio-economic weights in the optimization objective based on observed inequities in cost and renewable energy access. This RL-powered feedback loop enables the system to learn and adapt, continuously striving for a more equitable state. To ensure transparency, Explainable AI (XAI) is used to interpret the benefit allocations derived from a weighted Shapley value. Validated across six realistic scenarios, the framework demonstrates peak demand reductions of up to 72.6%, and significant cooperative gains. The adaptive RL mechanism further reduces the Gini coefficient over time, showcasing a pathway to truly sustainable and fair energy communities.

<title>Specification Self-Correction: Mitigating In-Context Reward Hacking Through Test-Time Refinement</title>

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are susceptible to in-context reward hacking, where they exploit flaws in tainted or faulty written specifications or rubrics to achieve high scores without fulfilling the user's true intent. We introduce Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output, and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted specifications in 50-70\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability by over 90\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior. Code at https://github.com/vicgalle/specification-self-correction .

<title>Agentic Program Repair from Test Failures at Scale: A Neuro-symbolic approach with static analysis and test execution feedback</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18755</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18755</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.18755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aim: With the advent of LLMs, sophisticated agentic program repair has become viable at large organizations with large codebases. In this work, we develop an Engineering Agent that fixes the source code based on test failures at scale across diverse software offerings internally.
  Method: Using Llama as the base, we employ the ReAct harness to develop an agent. We start with a test failure that was triaged by a rule-based test failure bot. We then set up an agentic harness and allow the agent to reason and run a set of 15 actions from reading a file to generating a patch. We provide feedback to the agent through static analysis and test failures so it can refine its solution. We leverage an LLM-as-a-Judge to ensure that the patch conforms to the standards followed by a human review to land fixes.
  Benchmark Findings: We curated offline benchmarks for our patch generator, the Engineering Agent loop, and the LLM-as-a-Judge. In offline evaluations we found that a specialized 70B model is highly competitive with the much larger but vanilla Llama-405B. In an ablation study, we found that the ReAct harness (neural model) benefited from the symbolic information from static analysis tools and test execution traces. A model that strikes a balance between the solve rate and error rate vs the cost and latency has a benchmark solve rate of 42.3% using an average 11.8 feedback iterations.
  Production Findings: In a three month period, 80% of the generated fixes were reviewed, of which 31.5% were landed (25.5% of the total number of generated fixes).
  Feedback from Engineers: We used open coding to extract qualitative themes from engineers' feedback. We saw positive feedback in the form of quick approvals, gratitude, and surprise. We also found mixed feedback when the Engineering Agent's solution was partially correct and it served as a good starting point.

<title>MemoCoder: Automated Function Synthesis using LLM-Supported Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18812</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.18812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, developers increasingly rely on AI-assisted tools to support code generation. While LLMs can generate syntactically correct solutions for well-structured programming tasks, they often struggle with challenges that require iterative debugging, error handling, or adaptation to diverse problem structures. Existing approaches such as fine-tuning or self-repair strategies either require costly retraining or lack mechanisms to accumulate and reuse knowledge from previous attempts.
  To address these limitations, we propose MemoCoder, a multi-agent framework that enables collaborative problem solving and persistent learning from past fixes. At the core of MemoCoder is a Fixing Knowledge Set, which stores successful repairs and supports retrieval for future tasks. A central Mentor Agent supervises the repair process by identifying recurring error patterns and refining high-level fixing strategies, providing a novel supervisory role that guides the self-repair loop. We evaluate MemoCoder across three public benchmarks -- MBPP, HumanEval, and LiveCodeBench -- spanning a range of problem complexities. Experimental results show that MemoCoder consistently outperforms both zero-shot prompting and a Self-Repair strategy, with improvements ranging from 3.1% to 12.1% in Pass@10 and from 1.4% to 14.5% in Pass@50, demonstrating its effectiveness in iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation.

<title>ThermoRL:Structure-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Protein Mutation Design to Enhance Thermostability</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18816</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.18816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing mutations to optimize protein thermostability remains challenging due to the complex relationship between sequence variations, structural dynamics, and thermostability, often assessed by \delta\delta G
  (the change in free energy of unfolding). Existing methods rely on experimental random mutagenesis or prediction models tested with pre-defined datasets, using sequence-based heuristics and treating enzyme design as a one-step process without iterative refinement, which limits design space exploration and restricts discoveries beyond known variations. We present ThermoRL, a framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages graph neural networks (GNN) to design mutations with enhanced thermostability. It combines a pre-trained GNN-based encoder with a hierarchical Q-learning network and employs a surrogate model for reward feedback, guiding the RL agent on where (the position) and which (mutant amino acid) to apply for enhanced thermostability. Experimental results show that ThermoRL achieves higher or comparable rewards than baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. It filters out destabilizing mutations and identifies stabilizing mutations aligned with experimental data. Moreover, ThermoRL accurately detects key mutation sites in unseen proteins, highlighting its strong generalizability. This RL-guided approach powered by GNN embeddings offers a robust alternative to traditional protein mutation design.

<title>Weak-to-Strong Generalization with Failure Trajectories: A Tree-based Approach to Elicit Optimal Policy in Strong Models</title>

arXiv:2507.18858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak-to-Strong generalization (W2SG) is a new trend to elicit the full capabilities of a strong model with supervision from a weak model. While existing W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we extend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments. Specifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate actions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so that the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents, we further construct ``trajectory trees," a hierarchical representation that organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis, we provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving W2SG performance. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements in reasoning and decision-making capabilities across diverse task domains, validating the scalability and robustness of our proposed framework.

<title>Learning Individual Intrinsic Reward in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Incorporating Generalized Human Expertise</title>

arXiv:2507.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a challenging problem when receiving only a team reward, especially in environments with sparse rewards. A powerful method to mitigate this issue involves crafting dense individual rewards to guide the agents toward efficient exploration. However, individual rewards generally rely on manually engineered shaping-reward functions that lack high-order intelligence, thus it behaves ineffectively than humans regarding learning and generalization in complex problems. To tackle these issues, we combine the above two paradigms and propose a novel framework, LIGHT (Learning Individual Intrinsic reward via Incorporating Generalized Human experTise), which can integrate human knowledge into MARL algorithms in an end-to-end manner. LIGHT guides each agent to avoid unnecessary exploration by considering both individual action distribution and human expertise preference distribution. Then, LIGHT designs individual intrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational transformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action preferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over representative baselines regarding performance and better knowledge reusability across different sparse-reward tasks on challenging scenarios.

Abstract: High-quality dialogue is crucial for e-commerce customer service, yet traditional intent-based systems struggle with dynamic, multi-turn interactions. We present MindFlow+, a self-evolving dialogue agent that learns domain-specific behavior by combining large language models (LLMs) with imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL). MindFlow+ introduces two data-centric mechanisms to guide learning: tool-augmented demonstration construction, which exposes the model to knowledge-enhanced and agentic (ReAct-style) interactions for effective tool use; and reward-conditioned data modeling, which aligns responses with task-specific goals using reward signals. To evaluate the model's role in response generation, we introduce the AI Contribution Ratio, a novel metric quantifying AI involvement in dialogue. Experiments on real-world e-commerce conversations show that MindFlow+ outperforms strong baselines in contextual relevance, flexibility, and task accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of combining LLMs tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning to build domain-specialized, context-aware dialogue systems.

Abstract: We propose a method to procedurally generate a familiar yet complex human artifact: the city. We are not trying to reproduce existing cities, but to generate artificial cities that are convincing and plausible by capturing developmental behavior. In addition, our results are meant to build upon themselves, such that they ought to look compelling at any point along the transition from village to metropolis. Our approach largely focuses upon land usage and building distribution for creating realistic city environments, whereas previous attempts at city modeling have mainly focused on populating road networks. Finally, we want our model to be self automated to the point that the only necessary input is a terrain description, but other high-level and low-level parameters can be specified to support artistic contributions. With the aid of agent based simulation we are generating a system of agents and behaviors that interact with one another through their effects upon a simulated environment. Our philosophy is that as each agent follows a simple behavioral rule set, a more complex behavior will tend to emerge out of the interactions between the agents and their differing rule sets. By confining our model to a set of simple rules for each class of agents, we hope to make our model extendible not only in regard to the types of structures that are produced, but also in describing the social and cultural influences prevalent in all cities

Abstract: Assessing the reproducibility of social science papers is essential for promoting rigor in research processes, but manual assessment is costly. With recent advances in agentic AI systems (i.e., AI agents), we seek to evaluate their capability to automate this process. However, existing benchmarks for reproducing research papers (1) focus solely on reproducing results using provided code and data without assessing their consistency with the paper, (2) oversimplify real-world scenarios, and (3) lack necessary diversity in data formats and programming languages. To address these issues, we introduce REPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances, each representing a social science paper with a publicly available reproduction report. The agents are tasked with assessing the reproducibility of the paper based on the original paper PDF and the corresponding reproduction package. REPRO-Bench features end-to-end evaluation tasks on the reproducibility of social science papers with complexity comparable to real-world assessments. We evaluate three representative AI agents on REPRO-Bench, with the best-performing agent achieving an accuracy of only 21.4%. Building on our empirical analysis, we develop REPRO-Agent, which improves the highest accuracy achieved by existing agents by 71%. We conclude that more advanced AI agents should be developed to automate real-world reproducibility assessment. REPRO-Bench is publicly available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/REPRO-Bench.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a major advancement in natural language processing (NLP), combining large language models (LLMs) with information retrieval systems to enhance factual grounding, accuracy, and contextual relevance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG, particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms, sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends, providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges related to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A comparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking performance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and computational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality, privacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally, the review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval approaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and agentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more reliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems.

Abstract: The quality of a conversation goes beyond the individual quality of each reply, and instead emerges from how these combine into interactional patterns that give the conversation its distinctive overall "shape". However, there is no robust automated method for comparing conversations in terms of their overall interactional dynamics. Such methods could enhance the analysis of conversational data and help evaluate conversational agents more holistically.
  In this work, we introduce a similarity measure for comparing conversations with respect to their dynamics. We design a validation framework for testing the robustness of the metric in capturing differences in conversation dynamics and for assessing its sensitivity to the topic of the conversations. Finally, to illustrate the measure's utility, we use it to analyze conversational dynamics in a large online community, bringing new insights into the role of situational power in conversations.

<title>SLICEMATE: Accurate and Scalable Static Program Slicing via LLM-Powered Agents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.18957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static program slicing, which extracts the executable portions of a program that affect the values at a specific location, supports many software analysis tasks such as debugging and security auditing. However, traditional slicing tools rely on computationally expensive reachability analysis over dependency graphs, which struggle to scale to large programs and often fail to handle code with incomplete syntax. Recently emerged learning-based methods, while more robust to such cases, still fall short of achieving comparable performance to traditional methods on well-formed code.
  In this work, we propose SliceMate, a novel static program slicing solution powered by Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It bypasses the need for explicit dependency graph construction and achieving superior slicing accuracy. Concretely, SliceMate integrates three specialized agents: (1) a synthesis agent that produces candidate slices by incrementally expanding the scan scope across functions and files guided by LLM-inferred dependencies; (2) a verification agent that performs conciseness and completeness checks of the candidate slices, detecting missing or irrelevant statements; and (3) a refinement agent that repairs the slices with minimal edits in accordance with the verification results. These agents are orchestrated by a control module that ensures timely convergence and outputs high-quality slices without manual intervention. For rigorous evaluation, we construct a new and high-quality benchmark, SliceBench, comprising 2,200 manually annotated Java and Python programs, with program lengths ranging from 5 to 8,577 lines, significantly larger than those in existing slicing benchmarks. Experimental results show that SliceMate greatly outperforms both traditional and learning-based slicing tools.

<title>Reinforcement Learning via Conservative Agent for Environments with Random Delays</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.18992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning applications are often hindered by delayed feedback from environments, which violates the Markov assumption and introduces significant challenges. Although numerous delay-compensating methods have been proposed for environments with constant delays, environments with random delays remain largely unexplored due to their inherent variability and unpredictability. In this study, we propose a simple yet robust agent for decision-making under random delays, termed the conservative agent, which reformulates the random-delay environment into its constant-delay equivalent. This transformation enables any state-of-the-art constant-delay method to be directly extended to the random-delay environments without modifying the algorithmic structure or sacrificing performance. We evaluate the conservative agent-based algorithm on continuous control tasks, and empirical results demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing baseline algorithms in terms of asymptotic performance and sample efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their associated agent-based frameworks have significantly advanced automated information extraction, a critical component of modern recommender systems. While these multitask frameworks are widely used in code generation, their application in data-centric research is still largely untapped. This paper presents Agent0, an LLM-driven, agent-based system designed to automate information extraction and feature construction from raw, unstructured text. Categorical features are crucial for large-scale recommender systems but are often expensive to acquire. Agent0 coordinates a group of interacting LLM agents to automatically identify the most valuable text aspects for subsequent tasks (such as models or AutoML pipelines). Beyond its feature engineering capabilities, Agent0 also offers an automated prompt-engineering tuning method that utilizes dynamic feedback loops from an oracle. Our findings demonstrate that this closed-loop methodology is both practical and effective for automated feature discovery, which is recognized as one of the most challenging phases in current recommender system development.

Abstract: In recent years, the frequent occurrence of disruptions has had a negative impact on global supply chains. To stay competitive, enterprises strive to remain agile through the implementation of efficient and effective decision-making strategies in reaction to disruptions. A significant effort has been made to develop these agile disruption mitigation approaches, leveraging both centralized and distributed decision-making strategies. Though trade-offs of centralized and distributed approaches have been analyzed in existing studies, no related work has been found on understanding supply chain performance based on the network attributes of the disrupted supply chain entities. In this paper, we characterize supply chains from a capability and network topological perspective and investigate the use of a distributed decision-making approach based on classical multi-agent frameworks. The performance of the distributed framework is evaluated through a comprehensive case study that investigates the performance of the supply chain as a function of the network structure and agent attributes within the network in the presence of a disruption. Comparison to a centralized decision-making approach highlights trade-offs between performance, computation time, and network communication based on the decision-making strategy and network architecture. Practitioners can use the outcomes of our studies to design response strategies based on agent capabilities, network attributes, and desired supply chain performance.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic brings many unexpected disruptions, such as frequently shifting markets and limited human workforce, to manufacturers. To stay competitive, flexible and real-time manufacturing decision-making strategies are needed to deal with such highly dynamic manufacturing environments. One essential problem is dynamic resource allocation to complete production tasks, especially when a resource disruption (e.g., machine breakdown) occurs. Though multi-agent methods have been proposed to solve the problem in a flexible and agile manner, the agent internal decision-making process and resource uncertainties have rarely been studied. This work introduces a model-based resource agent (RA) architecture that enables effective agent coordination and dynamic agent decision-making. Based on the RA architecture, a rescheduling strategy that incorporates risk assessment via a clustering agent coordination strategy is also proposed. A simulation-based case study is implemented to demonstrate dynamic rescheduling using the proposed multi-agent framework. The results show that the proposed method reduces the computational efforts while losing some throughput optimality compared to the centralized method. Furthermore, the case study illustrates that incorporating risk assessment into rescheduling decision-making improves the throughput.

Abstract: In the highly complex and stochastic global, supply chain environments, local enterprise agents seek distributed and dynamic strategies for agile responses to disruptions. Existing literature explores both centralized and distributed approaches, while most work neglects temporal dynamics and the heterogeneity of the risk management of individual agents. To address this gap, this letter presents a heterogeneous risk management mechanism to incorporate uncertainties and risk attitudes into agent communication and decision-making strategy. Hence, this approach empowers enterprises to handle disruptions in stochastic environments in a distributed way, and in particular in the context of multi-agent control and management. Through a simulated case study, we showcase the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach under stochastic settings and how the decision of disruption responses changes when agents hold various risk attitudes.

<title>Large Language Model-Based Task Offloading and Resource Allocation for Digital Twin Edge Computing Networks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19050</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general digital twin edge computing network comprising multiple vehicles and a server. Each vehicle generates multiple computing tasks within a time slot, leading to queuing challenges when offloading tasks to the server. The study investigates task offloading strategies, queue stability, and resource allocation. Lyapunov optimization is employed to transform long-term constraints into tractable short-term decisions. To solve the resulting problem, an in-context learning approach based on large language model (LLM) is adopted, replacing the conventional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the LLM-based method achieves comparable or even superior performance to MARL.

<title>Debating Truth: Debate-driven Claim Verification with Multiple Large Language Model Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19090</link>

Abstract: Claim verification is critical for enhancing digital literacy. However, the state-of-the-art single-LLM methods struggle with complex claim verification that involves multi-faceted evidences. Inspired by real-world fact-checking practices, we propose DebateCV, the first claim verification framework that adopts a debate-driven methodology using multiple LLM agents. In our framework, two Debaters take opposing stances on a claim and engage in multi-round argumentation, while a Moderator evaluates the arguments and renders a verdict with justifications. To further improve the performance of the Moderator, we introduce a novel post-training strategy that leverages synthetic debate data generated by the zero-shot DebateCV, effectively addressing the scarcity of real-world debate-driven claim verification data. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing claim verification methods under varying levels of evidence quality. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DebateCV-6781.

Abstract: Efficient indoor wireless network (IWN) planning is crucial for providing high-quality 5G in-building services. However, traditional meta-heuristic and artificial intelligence-based planning methods face significant challenges due to the intricate interplay between indoor environments (IEs) and IWN demands. In this article, we present an indoor wireless network Planning with large LANguage models (iPLAN) framework, which integrates multi-modal IE representations into large language model (LLM)-powered optimizers to improve IWN planning. First, we instate the role of LLMs as optimizers, outlining embedding techniques for IEs, and introducing two core applications of iPLAN: (i) IWN planning based on pre-existing IEs and (ii) joint design of IWN and IE for new wireless-friendly buildings. For the former, we embed essential information into LLM optimizers by leveraging indoor descriptions, domain-specific knowledge, and performance-driven perception. For the latter, we conceptualize a multi-agent strategy, where intelligent agents collaboratively address key planning sub-tasks in a step-by-step manner while ensuring optimal trade-offs between the agents. The simulation results demonstrate that iPLAN achieves superior performance in IWN planning tasks and optimizes building wireless performance through the joint design of IEs and IWNs, exemplifying a paradigm shift in IWN planning.

<title>OS-MAP: How Far Can Computer-Using Agents Go in Breadth and Depth?</title>

arXiv:2507.19132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-using agents have shown strong potential to boost human productivity and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15 applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future progress in computer-using agents research and deployment. All code, environments, baselines, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/OS-Copilot/OS-Map.

<title>Game-Theoretic Gradient Control for Robust Neural Network Training</title>

Abstract: Feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) are vulnerable to input noise, reducing prediction performance. Existing regularization methods like dropout often alter network architecture or overlook neuron interactions. This study aims to enhance FFNN noise robustness by modifying backpropagation, interpreted as a multi-agent game, and exploring controlled target variable noising. Our "gradient dropout" selectively nullifies hidden layer neuron gradients with probability 1 - p during backpropagation, while keeping forward passes active. This is framed within compositional game theory. Additionally, target variables were perturbed with white noise or stable distributions. Experiments on ten diverse tabular datasets show varying impacts: improvement or diminishing of robustness and accuracy, depending on dataset and hyperparameters. Notably, on regression tasks, gradient dropout (p = 0.9) combined with stable distribution target noising significantly increased input noise robustness, evidenced by flatter MSE curves and more stable SMAPE values. These results highlight the method's potential, underscore the critical role of adaptive parameter tuning, and open new avenues for analyzing neural networks as complex adaptive systems exhibiting emergent behavior within a game-theoretic framework.

<title>Diverse and Adaptive Behavior Curriculum for Autonomous Driving: A Student-Teacher Framework with Multi-Agent RL</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19146</link>

Abstract: Autonomous driving faces challenges in navigating complex real-world traffic, requiring safe handling of both common and critical scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL), a prominent method in end-to-end driving, enables agents to learn through trial and error in simulation. However, RL training often relies on rule-based traffic scenarios, limiting generalization. Additionally, current scenario generation methods focus heavily on critical scenarios, neglecting a balance with routine driving behaviors. Curriculum learning, which progressively trains agents on increasingly complex tasks, is a promising approach to improving the robustness and coverage of RL driving policies. However, existing research mainly emphasizes manually designed curricula, focusing on scenery and actor placement rather than traffic behavior dynamics. This work introduces a novel student-teacher framework for automatic curriculum learning. The teacher, a graph-based multi-agent RL component, adaptively generates traffic behaviors across diverse difficulty levels. An adaptive mechanism adjusts task difficulty based on student performance, ensuring exposure to behaviors ranging from common to critical. The student, though exchangeable, is realized as a deep RL agent with partial observability, reflecting real-world perception constraints. Results demonstrate the teacher's ability to generate diverse traffic behaviors. The student, trained with automatic curricula, outperformed agents trained on rule-based traffic, achieving higher rewards and exhibiting balanced, assertive driving.

<title>ReCoDe: Reinforcement Learning-based Dynamic Constraint Design for Multi-Agent Coordination</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.19151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint-based optimization is a cornerstone of robotics, enabling the design of controllers that reliably encode task and safety requirements such as collision avoidance or formation adherence. However, handcrafted constraints can fail in multi-agent settings that demand complex coordination. We introduce ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate, context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines. We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the degree to which it relies on this controller.

<title>Event-Driven Storytelling with Multiple Lifelike Humans in a 3D Scene</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.19232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a framework that creates a lively virtual dynamic scene with contextual motions of multiple humans. Generating multi-human contextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among human-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large language model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input and convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate multi-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before. Specifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a dynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a well-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we synthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial guidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive context, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the retrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale and with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of contextual reasoning. Benchmark results and user studies show that our framework effectively captures scene context with high scalability. The code and benchmark, along with result videos, are available at our project page: https://rms0329.github.io/Event-Driven-Storytelling/.

<title>CoopTrack: Exploring End-to-End Learning for Efficient Cooperative Sequential Perception</title>

Abstract: Cooperative perception aims to address the inherent limitations of single-vehicle autonomous driving systems through information exchange among multiple agents. Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components: Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance. Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP and 32.8\% AMOTA. The project is available at https://github.com/zhongjiaru/CoopTrack.

<title>Modeling Uncertainty: Constraint-Based Belief States in Imperfect-Information Games</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.19263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In imperfect-information games, agents must make decisions based on partial knowledge of the game state. The Belief Stochastic Game model addresses this challenge by delegating state estimation to the game model itself. This allows agents to operate on externally provided belief states, thereby reducing the need for game-specific inference logic. This paper investigates two approaches to represent beliefs in games with hidden piece identities: a constraint-based model using Constraint Satisfaction Problems and a probabilistic extension using Belief Propagation to estimate marginal probabilities. We evaluated the impact of both representations using general-purpose agents across two different games. Our findings indicate that constraint-based beliefs yield results comparable to those of probabilistic inference, with minimal differences in agent performance. This suggests that constraint-based belief states alone may suffice for effective decision-making in many settings.

<title>Mut4All: Fuzzing Compilers via LLM-Synthesized Mutators Learned from Bug Reports</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19275</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Mutation-based fuzzing is effective for uncovering compiler bugs, but designing high-quality mutators for modern languages with complex constructs (e.g., templates, macros) remains challenging. Existing methods rely heavily on manual design or human-in-the-loop correction, limiting scalability and cross-language generalizability.
  We present Mut4All, a fully automated, language-agnostic framework that synthesizes mutators using Large Language Models (LLMs) and compiler-specific knowledge from bug reports. It consists of three agents: (1) a mutator invention agent that identifies mutation targets and generates mutator metadata using compiler-related insights; (2) a mutator implementation synthesis agent, fine-tuned to produce initial implementations; and (3) a mutator refinement agent that verifies and corrects the mutators via unit-test feedback.
  Mut4All processes 1000 bug reports (500 Rust, 500 C++), yielding 319 Rust and 403 C++ mutators at ~$0.08 each via GPT-4o. Our customized fuzzer, using these mutators, finds 62 bugs in Rust compilers (38 new, 7 fixed) and 34 bugs in C++ compilers (16 new, 1 fixed). Mut4All outperforms existing methods in both unique crash detection and coverage, ranking first on Rust and second on C++.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.19349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In emerging communication systems such as sixth generation (6G) wireless networks, efficient resource management and service delivery rely on accurate knowledge of spatially-varying quantities like signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) maps, which are costly to acquire at high resolution. This work explores the reconstruction of such spatial signals from sparse measurements using Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs), offering a low-complexity alternative to traditional neural networks. The concept of GENEO, which originated in topological data analysis (TDA), is a mathematical tool used in machine learning to represent agents modelled as functional operators acting on data while incorporating application-specific invariances. Leveraging these invariances reduces the number of parameters with respect to traditional neural networks and mitigates data scarcity by enforcing known algebraic and geometric constraints that reflect symmetries in the agents' actions. In this paper, we introduce a novel GENEO-based approach for SINR map reconstruction in urban wireless communication networks using extremely sparse sampling. We demonstrate that this mathematical framework achieves competitive performance compared to established methods. Our evaluation, conducted using both statistical and TDA metrics, highlights the advantages of our approach in accurately reconstructing spatial signals under severe data limitations on the number of samples.

arXiv:2507.19364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This position paper examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in social simulation, analyzing both their potential and their limitations from a computational social science perspective. The first part reviews recent findings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition, including Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also highlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true understanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys emerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on system architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such as Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of their design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations. Particular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity, calibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The final section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box systems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious games-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or predictive modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches that integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA, Netlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of language-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of classical rule-based systems.

<title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Scheduling for Wi-Fi Multi-Access Point Coordination</title>

arXiv:2507.19377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key feature of IEEE 802.11bn, with a potential impact on future Wi-Fi networks. MAPC enables joint scheduling decisions across multiple access points (APs) to improve throughput, latency, and reliability in dense Wi-Fi deployments. However, implementing efficient scheduling policies under diverse traffic and interference conditions in overlapping basic service sets (OBSSs) remains a complex task. This paper presents a method to minimize the network-wide worst-case latency by formulating MAPC scheduling as a sequential decision-making problem and proposing a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) mechanism to minimize worst-case delays in OBSS deployments. Specifically, we train a DRL agent using proximal policy optimization (PPO) within an 802.11bn-compatible Gymnasium environment. This environment provides observations of queue states, delay metrics, and channel conditions, enabling the agent to schedule multiple AP-station pairs to transmit simultaneously by leveraging spatial reuse (SR) groups. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed solution outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic strategies across a wide range of network loads and traffic patterns. The trained machine learning (ML) models consistently achieve lower 99th-percentile delays, showing up to a 30% improvement over the best baseline.

<title>SILS: Strategic Influence on Liquidity Stability and Whale Detection in Concentrated-Liquidity DEXs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods for identifying impactful liquidity providers (LPs) in Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) rely on broad measures, such as nominal capital size or surface-level activity, which often lead to inaccurate risk analysis. The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed approach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic systemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents a fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a dynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain event logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential Time-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly detection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through the Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that measures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This combined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an LP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used by existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables SILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by traditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective oracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing DeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the underlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the common false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in traditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for proactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their ecosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior.

arXiv:2507.19437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing latent variations ("contexts") is key to deploying reinforcement-learning (RL) agents beyond their training regime. We recast context-based RL as a dual inference-control problem and formally characterize two properties and their hierarchy: observation sufficiency (preserving all predictive information) and control sufficiency (retaining decision-making relevant information). Exploiting this dichotomy, we derive a contextual evidence lower bound(ELBO)-style objective that cleanly separates representation learning from policy learning and optimizes it with Bottlenecked Contextual Policy Optimization (BCPO), an algorithm that places a variational information-bottleneck encoder in front of any off-policy policy learner. On standard continuous-control benchmarks with shifting physical parameters, BCPO matches or surpasses other baselines while using fewer samples and retaining performance far outside the training regime. The framework unifies theory, diagnostics, and practice for context-based RL.

<title>Existence of 2-EFX Allocations of Chores</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We study the fair division of indivisible chores among agents with additive disutility functions. We investigate the existence of allocations satisfying the popular fairness notion of envy-freeness up to any chore (EFX), and its multiplicative approximations. The existence of $4$-EFX allocations was recently established by Garg, Murhekar, and Qin (2025). We improve this guarantee by proving the existence of $2$-EFX allocations for all instances with additive disutilities. This approximation was previously known only for restricted instances such as bivalued disutilities (Lin, Wu, and Zhou (2025)) or three agents (Afshinmehr, Ansaripour, Danaei, and Mehlhorn (2024)).
  We obtain our result by providing a general framework for achieving approximate-EFX allocations. The approach begins with a suitable initial allocation and performs a sequence of local swaps between the bundles of envious and envied agents. For our main result, we begin with an initial allocation that satisfies envy-freeness up to one chore (EF1) and Pareto-optimality (PO); the existence of such an allocation was recently established in a major breakthrough by Mahara (2025). We further demonstrate the strength and generality of our framework by giving simple and unified proofs of existing results, namely (i) $2$-EFX for bivalued instances, (ii) 2-EFX for three agents, (iii) EFX when the number of chores is at most twice the number of agents, and (iv) $4$-EFX for all instances. We expect this framework to have broader applications in approximate-EFX due to its simplicity and generality.

arXiv:2507.19478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MMBench-GUI, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI automation agents across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web platforms. It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills for GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA) metric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios. Through MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical determinant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of modular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore, to achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and cross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad action space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important, task efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models suffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even when tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization, effective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable truly efficient and scalable GUI automation.

<title>Finance as Extended Biology: Reciprocity as the Cognitive Substrate of Financial Behavior</title>

Abstract: A central challenge in economics and artificial intelligence is explaining how financial behaviors-such as credit, insurance, and trade-emerge without formal institutions. We argue that these functions are not products of institutional design, but structured extensions of a single behavioral substrate: reciprocity. Far from being a derived strategy, reciprocity served as the foundational logic of early human societies-governing the circulation of goods, regulation of obligation, and maintenance of long-term cooperation well before markets, money, or formal rules. Trade, commonly regarded as the origin of financial systems, is reframed here as the canonical form of reciprocity: simultaneous, symmetric, and partner-contingent. Building on this logic, we reconstruct four core financial functions-credit, insurance, token exchange, and investment-as expressions of the same underlying principle under varying conditions. By grounding financial behavior in minimal, simulateable dynamics of reciprocal interaction, this framework shifts the focus from institutional engineering to behavioral computation-offering a new foundation for modeling decentralized financial behavior in both human and artificial agents.

<title>Optimizing Metachronal Paddling with Reinforcement Learning at Low Reynolds Number</title>

Abstract: Metachronal paddling is a swimming strategy in which an organism oscillates sets of adjacent limbs with a constant phase lag, propagating a metachronal wave through its limbs and propelling it forward. This limb coordination strategy is utilized by swimmers across a wide range of Reynolds numbers, which suggests that this metachronal rhythm was selected for its optimality of swimming performance. In this study, we apply reinforcement learning to a swimmer at zero Reynolds number and investigate whether the learning algorithm selects this metachronal rhythm, or if other coordination patterns emerge. We design the swimmer agent with an elongated body and pairs of straight, inflexible paddles placed along the body for various fixed paddle spacings. Based on paddle spacing, the swimmer agent learns qualitatively different coordination patterns. At tight spacings, a back-to-front metachronal wave-like stroke emerges which resembles the commonly observed biological rhythm, but at wide spacings, different limb coordinations are selected. Across all resulting strokes, the fastest stroke is dependent on the number of paddles, however, the most efficient stroke is a back-to-front wave-like stroke regardless of the number of paddles.

Abstract: Topological defects in active polar fluids exhibit complex dynamics driven by internally generated stresses, reflecting the deep interplay between topology, flow, and non-equilibrium hydrodynamics. Feedback control offers a powerful means to guide such systems, enabling transitions between dynamic states. We investigated closed-loop steering of integer-charged defects in a confined active fluid by modulating the spatial profile of activity. Using a continuum hydrodynamic model, we show that localized control of active stress induces flow fields that can reposition and direct defects along prescribed trajectories by exploiting non-linear couplings in the system. A reinforcement learning framework is used to discover effective control strategies that produce robust defect transport across both trained and novel trajectories. The results highlight how AI agents can learn the underlying dynamics and spatially structure activity to manipulate topological excitations, offering insights into the controllability of active matter and the design of adaptive, self-organized materials.

Abstract: Recent capability increases in large language models (LLMs) open up applications in which groups of communicating generative AI agents solve joint tasks. This poses privacy and security challenges concerning the unauthorised sharing of information, or other unwanted forms of agent coordination. Modern steganographic techniques could render such dynamics hard to detect. In this paper, we comprehensively formalise the problem of secret collusion in systems of generative AI agents by drawing on relevant concepts from both AI and security literature. We study incentives for the use of steganography, and propose a variety of mitigation measures. Our investigations result in a model evaluation framework that systematically tests capabilities required for various forms of secret collusion. We provide extensive empirical results across a range of contemporary LLMs. While the steganographic capabilities of current models remain limited, GPT-4 displays a capability jump suggesting the need for continuous monitoring of steganographic frontier model capabilities. We conclude by laying out a comprehensive research program to mitigate future risks of collusion between generative AI models.

Abstract: Function calling significantly extends the application boundary of large language models, where high-quality and diverse training data is critical for unlocking this capability. However, real function-calling data is quite challenging to collect and annotate, while synthetic data generated by existing pipelines tends to lack coverage and accuracy. In this paper, we present ToolACE, an automatic agentic pipeline designed to generate accurate, complex, and diverse tool-learning data. ToolACE leverages a novel self-evolution synthesis process to curate a comprehensive API pool of 26,507 diverse APIs. Dialogs are further generated through the interplay among multiple agents, guided by a formalized thinking process. To ensure data accuracy, we implement a dual-layer verification system combining rule-based and model-based checks. We demonstrate that models trained on our synthesized data, even with only 8B parameters, achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard, rivaling the latest GPT-4 models. Our model and a subset of the data are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/Team-ACE.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, especially in sparse-reward domains, many environment steps are required to observe reward information. In order to increase the frequency of such observations, "potential-based reward shaping" (PBRS) has been proposed as a method of providing a more dense reward signal while leaving the optimal policy invariant. However, the required "potential function" must be carefully designed with task-dependent knowledge to not deter training performance. In this work, we propose a "bootstrapped" method of reward shaping, termed BSRS, in which the agent's current estimate of the state-value function acts as the potential function for PBRS. We provide convergence proofs for the tabular setting, give insights into training dynamics for deep RL, and show that the proposed method improves training speed in the Atari suite.

Abstract: Controlling energy systems usually involves manually designed policies for decision-making, which can be complex and time-consuming to develop. This process requires interdisciplinary collaboration among multiple domain experts, resulting in slow and inflexible adaptation to rapidly changing environments. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising paradigm shift by integrating extensive contextual knowledge with the capability to generate structured, executable code.
  We present Agentic Policy Search (APS) -- a novel hierarchical optimization framework in which LLMs act as autonomous agents that propose complete control logics, translate them into executable code, and iteratively improve them through direct system feedback. We apply APS to a residential energy system with PV, battery, demand, and dynamic electricity prices. Within just seven simulated days, the method yields a net profit of up to 6.20 EUR compared to the no-battery reference scenario (-10.70 EUR), nearly matching the global optimum of a perfectly informed linear program. By combining LLM-driven policy search with the generation of human-interpretable control logic, APS effectively bridges adaptability and traceability in energy management -- while also offering a transferable framework for agentic optimization in other domains.

<title>Towards Improving Reward Design in RL: A Reward Alignment Metric for RL Practitioners</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents are fundamentally limited by the quality of the reward functions they learn from, yet reward design is often overlooked under the assumption that a well-defined reward is readily available. However, in practice, designing rewards is difficult, and even when specified, evaluating their correctness is equally problematic: how do we know if a reward function is correctly specified? In our work, we address these challenges by focusing on reward alignment -- assessing whether a reward function accurately encodes the preferences of a human stakeholder. As a concrete measure of reward alignment, we introduce the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient to quantify the similarity between a human stakeholder's ranking of trajectory distributions and those induced by a given reward function. We show that the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient exhibits desirable properties, such as not requiring access to a ground truth reward, invariance to potential-based reward shaping, and applicability to online RL. Additionally, in an 11 -- person user study of RL practitioners, we found that access to the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient during reward selection led to statistically significant improvements. Compared to relying only on reward functions, our metric reduced cognitive workload by 1.5x, was preferred by 82% of users and increased the success rate of selecting reward functions that produced performant policies by 41%.

Abstract: AI Agents powered by Large Language Models are transforming the world through enormous applications. A super agent has the potential to fulfill diverse user needs, such as summarization, coding, and research, by accurately understanding user intent and leveraging the appropriate tools to solve tasks. However, to make such an agent viable for real-world deployment and accessible at scale, significant optimizations are required to ensure high efficiency and low cost. This position paper presents a design of the Super Agent System powered by the hybrid AI routers. Upon receiving a user prompt, the system first detects the intent of the user, then routes the request to specialized task agents with the necessary tools or automatically generates agentic workflows. In practice, most applications directly serve as AI assistants on edge devices such as phones and robots. As different language models vary in capability and cloud-based models often entail high computational costs, latency, and privacy concerns, we then explore the hybrid mode where the router dynamically selects between local and cloud models based on task complexity. Finally, we introduce the blueprint of an on-device super agent enhanced with cloud. With advances in multi-modality models and edge hardware, we envision that most computations can be handled locally, with cloud collaboration only as needed. Such architecture paves the way for super agents to be seamlessly integrated into everyday life in the near future.

Abstract: Accurately identifying synthesis conditions for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) remains a critical bottleneck in materials research, as translating literature-derived knowledge into actionable insights is hindered by the unstructured and heterogeneous nature of scientific texts. Here we present MOFh6, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to extract, structure, and apply synthesis knowledge from diverse input formats, including raw literature and crystal codes. Built on gpt-4o-mini and fine-tuned with up to few-shot expert-annotated data, MOFh6 achieves 99% accuracy in synthesis data parsing and resolves 94.1% of complex co-reference abbreviations. It processes a single full-text document in 9.6 seconds and localizes structured synthesis descriptions within 36 seconds, with the cost per 100 papers reduced to USD 4.24, a 76% saving over existing systems. By addressing long-standing limitations in cross-paragraph semantic fusion and terminology standardization, MOFh6 reshapes the LLM-based paradigm for MOF synthesis research, transforming static retrieval into an integrated and dynamic knowledge acquisition process. This shift bridges the gap between scientific literature and actionable synthesis design, providing a scalable framework for accelerating materials discovery.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the field of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world clinical consultations still faces core challenges. Single-round consultation systems require patients to describe all symptoms upfront, leading to vague diagnosis with unclear complaints. Traditional multi-turn dialogue models, constrained by static supervised learning, lack flexibility and fail to intelligently extract key clinical information. To address these limitations, we propose \Ours{}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent, dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive rewards from the Consultation Evaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables LLMs to autonomously develop interaction strategies aligned with clinical reasoning logic, rather than superficially imitating patterns in existing dialogue data. Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient interactions. Experiments demonstrate that \Ours{} outperforms existing models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic performance. This approach shows immense practical value by reducing misdiagnosis risks in time-pressured settings, freeing clinicians for complex cases, and pioneering a strategy to optimize medical resource allocation and alleviate workforce shortages.

Abstract: Psychological counseling faces huge challenges due to the growing demand for mental health services and the shortage of trained professionals. Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to assist psychological counseling, especially in empathy and emotional support. However, existing models lack a deep understanding of emotions and are unable to generate personalized treatment plans based on fine-grained emotions. To address these shortcomings, we present AI PsyRoom, a multi-agent simulation framework designed to enhance psychological counseling by generating empathetic and emotionally nuanced conversations. By leveraging fine-grained emotion classification and a multi-agent framework, we construct a multi-agent PsyRoom A for dialogue reconstruction, generating a high-quality dialogue dataset EmoPsy, which contains 35 sub-emotions, 423 specific emotion scenarios, and 12,350 dialogues. We also propose PsyRoom B for generating personalized treatment plans. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AI PsyRoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 18% improvement in problem orientation, 23% in expression, 24% in Empathy, and 16% in interactive communication quality. The datasets and models are publicly available, providing a foundation for advancing AI-assisted psychological counseling research.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce Delphos, a deep reinforcement learning framework for assisting the discrete choice model specification process. Unlike traditional approaches that treat model specification as a static optimisation problem, Delphos represents a paradigm shift: it frames this specification challenge as a sequential decision-making problem, formalised as a Markov Decision Process. In this setting, an agent learns to specify well-performing model candidates by choosing a sequence of modelling actions - such as selecting variables, accommodating both generic and alternative-specific taste parameters, applying non-linear transformations, and including interactions with covariates - and interacting with a modelling environment that estimates each candidate and returns a reward signal. Specifically, Delphos uses a Deep Q-Network that receives delayed rewards based on modelling outcomes (e.g., log-likelihood) and behavioural expectations (e.g., parameter signs), and distributes rewards across the sequence of actions to learn which modelling decisions lead to well-performing candidates. We evaluate Delphos on both simulated and empirical datasets, varying the size of the modelling space and the reward function. To assess the agent's performance in navigating the model space, we analyse the learning curve, the distribution of Q-values, occupancy metrics, and Pareto fronts. Our results show that the agent learns to adaptively explore strategies to identify well-performing models across search spaces, even without prior domain knowledge. It efficiently explores large modelling spaces, concentrates its search in high-reward regions, and suggests candidates that define Pareto frontiers balancing model fit and behavioural plausibility. These findings highlight the potential of this novel adaptive, learning-based framework to assist in the model specification process.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes, \textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration}, \textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements, acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving. While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI education.

However, provenance is often too detailed and not contextualized for the user trying to understand the AI system. In this work, we present our vision for an interactive agent that works together with the user to co-construct an explanation that is simultaneously useful to the user as well as grounded in data provenance. To illustrate this vision, we present: 1) an initial prototype of such an agent; and 2) a scalable evaluation framework based on user simulations and a large language model as a judge approach.

Abstract: In future AI-native wireless networks, the presence of mismatches between the latent spaces of independently designed and trained deep neural network (DNN) encoders may impede mutual understanding due to the emergence of semantic channel noise. This undermines the receiver's ability to interpret transmitted representations, thereby reducing overall system performance. To address this issue, we propose the Parseval Frame Equalizer (PFE), a zero-shot, frame-based semantic channel equalizer that aligns latent spaces of heterogeneous encoders without requiring system retraining. PFE enables dynamic signal compression and expansion, mitigating semantic noise while preserving performance on downstream tasks. Building on this capability, we introduce a dynamic optimization strategy that coordinates communication, computation, and learning resources to balance energy consumption, end-to-end (E2E) latency, and task performance in multi-agent semantic communication scenarios. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of our approach in maintaining semantic consistency and meeting long-term constraints on latency and accuracy under diverse and time-varying network conditions.

Abstract: Building on the conceptual framework presented in our previous work on agentic AI for pharmaceutical research, this paper provides a comprehensive technical analysis of Tippy's multi-agent system implementation for drug discovery laboratory automation. We present a distributed microservices architecture featuring five specialized agents (Supervisor, Molecule, Lab, Analysis, and Report) that coordinate through OpenAI Agents SDK orchestration and access laboratory tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The system architecture encompasses agent-specific tool integration, asynchronous communication patterns, and comprehensive configuration management through Git-based tracking. Our production deployment strategy utilizes Kubernetes container orchestration with Helm charts, Docker containerization, and CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment. The implementation integrates vector databases for RAG functionality and employs an Envoy reverse proxy for secure external access. This work demonstrates how specialized AI agents can effectively coordinate complex laboratory workflows while maintaining security, scalability, reliability, and integration with existing laboratory infrastructure through standardized protocols.

While these methods can be applied to derive more optimal control decisions, they often lack safety assurances. This paper proposes a framework based on control barrier functions to facilitate safe learning and deployment of reinforcement learning agents for power system control applications, specifically in the context of automatic generation control. We develop the safety barriers and reinforcement learning framework necessary to establish trust in reinforcement learning as a safe option for automatic generation control - as foundation for future detailed verification and application studies.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA (Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive workflows in agent design for data analysis.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances situational awareness in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Ad hoc networks of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) allow for real-time data sharing, but they face security challenges due to their decentralized nature, making them vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks. This paper introduces a trust-based framework for assured sensor fusion in distributed multi-agent networks, utilizing a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based approach to estimate the trustworthiness of agents and their provided information in a decentralized fashion. Trust-informed data fusion prioritizes fusing data from reliable sources, enhancing resilience and accuracy in contested environments. To evaluate the assured sensor fusion under attacks on system/mission sensing, we present a novel multi-agent aerial dataset built from the Unreal Engine simulator. We demonstrate through case studies improved ISR performance and an ability to detect malicious actors in adversarial settings.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of generative AI (GenAI) have begun to reshape how games are designed and developed, offering new tools for content creation, gameplay simulation, and design ideation. While prior research has explored traditional uses of AI in games, such as controlling agents or generating procedural content. There is limited empirical understanding of how GenAI is adopted by developers in real-world contexts, especially within the open-source community. This study aims to explore how GenAI technologies are discussed, adopted, and integrated into open-source game development by analyzing issue discussions on GitHub. We investigate the tools, tasks, and challenges associated with GenAI by comparing GenAI-related issues to those involving traditional AI (TradAI) and NonAI topics. Our goal is to uncover how GenAI differs from other approaches in terms of usage patterns, developer concerns, and integration practices. To address this objective, we construct a dataset of open-source game repositories that discuss AI-related topics. We apply open card sorting and thematic analysis to a stratified sample of GitHub issues, labelling each by type and content. These annotations enable comparative analysis across GenAI, TradAI, and NonAI groups, and provide insight into how GenAI is shaping the workflows and pain points of open-source game developers.

<title>FCPO: Federated Continual Policy Optimization for Real-Time High-Throughput Edge Video Analytics</title>

Abstract: The growing complexity of Edge Video Analytics (EVA) facilitates new kind of intelligent applications, but creates challenges in real-time inference serving systems. State-of-the-art (SOTA) scheduling systems optimize global workload distributions for heterogeneous devices but often suffer from extended scheduling cycles, leading to sub-optimal processing in rapidly changing Edge environments. Local Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables quick adjustments between cycles but faces scalability, knowledge integration, and adaptability issues. Thus, we propose FCPO, which combines Continual RL (CRL) with Federated RL (FRL) to address these challenges. This integration dynamically adjusts inference batch sizes, input resolutions, and multi-threading during pre- and post-processing. CRL allows agents to learn from changing Markov Decision Processes, capturing dynamic environmental variations, while FRL improves generalization and convergence speed by integrating experiences across inference models. FCPO combines these via an agent-specific aggregation scheme and a diversity-aware experience buffer. Experiments on a real-world EVA testbed showed over 5 times improvement in effective throughput, 60% reduced latency, and 20% faster convergence with up to 10 times less memory consumption compared to SOTA RL-based approaches.

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution. MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across 6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

<title>TELEVAL: A Dynamic Benchmark Designed for Spoken Language Models in Chinese Interactive Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance. However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models (LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress, existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

<title>Towards Microgrid Resilience Enhancement via Mobile Power Sources and Repair Crews: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18095</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.18095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile power sources (MPSs) have been gradually deployed in microgrids as critical resources to coordinate with repair crews (RCs) towards resilience enhancement owing to their flexibility and mobility in handling the complex coupled power-transport systems. However, previous work solves the coordinated dispatch problem of MPSs and RCs in a centralized manner with the assumption that the communication network is still fully functioning after the event. However, there is growing evidence that certain extreme events will damage or degrade communication infrastructure, which makes centralized decision making impractical. To fill this gap, this paper formulates the resilience-driven dispatch problem of MPSs and RCs in a decentralized framework. To solve this problem, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning method featuring a two-level framework is proposed, where the high-level action is used to switch decision-making between power and transport networks, and the low-level action constructed via a hybrid policy is used to compute continuous scheduling and discrete routing decisions in power and transport networks, respectively. The proposed method also uses an embedded function encapsulating system dynamics to enhance learning stability and scalability. Case studies based on IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus power networks are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in load restoration.

<title>Two-Stage TSO-DSO Services Provision Framework for Electric Vehicle Coordination</title>

Abstract: High renewable penetration has been witnessed in power systems, resulting in reduced system inertia and increasing requirements for frequency response services. Electric vehicles (EVs), owing to their vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities, can provide cost-effective frequency services for transmission system operators (TSOs). However, EVs that are inherently connected to distribution networks may pose voltage security issues for distribution system operators (DSOs) when supporting TSO frequency. To coordinate both TSO frequency and DSO voltage, this paper proposes a two-stage service provision framework for multi-EVs. At stage one, EVs participate in day-ahead TSO-DSO interactions for frequency reserve schedules; at stage two, EVs make real-time dispatching behaviors in distribution networks for reserve delivery while supporting DSO voltage. Considering the potentially large EV number and environment complexity, a decentralized operation paradigm is introduced for real-time EV dispatches at stage two, while a communication-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to reduce the communication overhead during large-scale multi-agent RL training without compromising policy performance. Case studies are carried out on a 6-bus transmission and 33-bus distribution network as well as a 69-bus distribution network to evaluate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method in enabling EVs for frequency service and voltage support.

<title>Percentile-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning and Reward Based Personalization For Delay Aware RAN Slicing in O-RAN</title>

arXiv:2507.18111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization. Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN), then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay. Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic patterns and model weight distance similarities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular, task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging. For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name. These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

Abstract: The growing need for intelligent, adaptive, and energy-efficient autonomous systems across fields such as robotics, mobile agents (e.g., UAVs), and self-driving vehicles is driving interest in neuromorphic computing. By drawing inspiration from biological neural systems, neuromorphic approaches offer promising pathways to enhance the perception, decision-making, and responsiveness of autonomous platforms. This paper surveys recent progress in neuromorphic algorithms, specialized hardware, and cross-layer optimization strategies, with a focus on their deployment in real-world autonomous scenarios. Special attention is given to event-based dynamic vision sensors and their role in enabling fast, efficient perception. The discussion highlights new methods that improve energy efficiency, robustness, adaptability, and reliability through the integration of spiking neural networks into autonomous system architectures. We integrate perspectives from machine learning, robotics, neuroscience, and neuromorphic engineering to offer a comprehensive view of the state of the field. Finally, emerging trends and open challenges are explored, particularly in the areas of real-time decision-making, continual learning, and the development of secure, resilient autonomous systems.

<title>ProactiveVA: Proactive Visual Analytics with LLM-Based UI Agent</title>

Abstract: Visual analytics (VA) is typically applied to complex data, thus requiring complex tools. While visual analytics empowers analysts in data analysis, analysts may get lost in the complexity occasionally. This highlights the need for intelligent assistance mechanisms. However, even the latest LLM-assisted VA systems only provide help when explicitly requested by the user, making them insufficiently intelligent to offer suggestions when analysts need them the most. We propose a ProactiveVA framework in which LLM-powered UI agent monitors user interactions and delivers context-aware assistance proactively. To design effective proactive assistance, we first conducted a formative study analyzing help-seeking behaviors in user interaction logs, identifying when users need proactive help, what assistance they require, and how the agent should intervene. Based on this analysis, we distilled key design requirements in terms of intent recognition, solution generation, interpretability and controllability. Guided by these requirements, we develop a three-stage UI agent pipeline including perception, reasoning, and acting. The agent autonomously perceives users' needs from VA interaction logs, providing tailored suggestions and intuitive guidance through interactive exploration of the system. We implemented the framework in two representative types of VA systems, demonstrating its generalizability, and evaluated the effectiveness through an algorithm evaluation, case and expert study and a user study. We also discuss current design trade-offs of proactive VA and areas for further exploration.

arXiv:2507.18224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) based on large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful solution for dealing with complex problems across diverse domains. The effectiveness of MAS is critically dependent on its collaboration topology, which has become a focal point for automated design research. However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on a template graph modification paradigm with a predefined set of agents and hard-coded interaction structures, significantly limiting their adaptability to task-specific requirements. To address these limitations, we reframe MAS design as a conditional autoregressive graph generation task, where both the system composition and structure are designed jointly. We propose ARG-Designer, a novel autoregressive model that operationalizes this paradigm by constructing the collaboration graph from scratch. Conditioned on a natural language task query, ARG-Designer sequentially and dynamically determines the required number of agents, selects their appropriate roles from an extensible pool, and establishes the optimal communication links between them. This generative approach creates a customized topology in a flexible and extensible manner, precisely tailored to the unique demands of different tasks. Extensive experiments across six diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ARG-Designer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also enjoys significantly greater token efficiency and enhanced extensibility. The source code of ARG-Designer is available at https://github.com/Shiy-Li/ARG-Designer.

<title>On Pareto-Optimal and Fair Allocations with Personalized Bi-Valued Utilities</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.18251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fair division problem of allocating $m$ indivisible goods to $n$ agents with additive personalized bi-valued utilities. Specifically, each agent $i$ assigns one of two positive values $a_i > b_i > 0$ to each good, indicating that agent $i$'s valuation of any good is either $a_i$ or $b_i$. For convenience, we denote the value ratio of agent $i$ as $r_i = a_i / b_i$.
  We give a characterization to all the Pareto-optimal allocations. Our characterization implies a polynomial-time algorithm to decide if a given allocation is Pareto-optimal in the case each $r_i$ is an integer. For the general case (where $r_i$ may be fractional), we show that this decision problem is coNP-complete. Our result complements the existing results: this decision problem is coNP-complete for tri-valued utilities (where each agent's value for each good belongs to $\{a,b,c\}$ for some prescribed $a>b>c\geq0$), and this decision problem belongs to P for bi-valued utilities (where $r_i$ in our model is the same for each agent).
  We further show that an EFX allocation always exists and can be computed in polynomial time under the personalized bi-valued utilities setting, which extends the previous result on bi-valued utilities. We propose the open problem of whether an EFX and Pareto-optimal allocation always exists (and can be computed in polynomial time).

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robots (EAIR) is an emerging and rapidly evolving technological domain. Ensuring their program correctness is fundamental to their successful deployment. However, a general and in-depth understanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the development of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs.
  To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR system bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their symptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes considerable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15 distinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new interesting findings and implications which help shed light on future research on tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified symptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is characterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards. Second, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the majority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and decision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction, detection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and the modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to focus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.

Abstract: Autonomous traffic agents (ATAs) are expected to act in ways tat are not only safe, but also aligned with stakeholder values across legal, social, and moral dimensions. In this paper, we adopt an established formal model of conflict from epistemic game theory to support the development of such agents. We focus on value conflicts-situations in which agents face competing goals rooted in value-laden situations and show how conflict analysis can inform key phases of the design process. This includes value elicitation, capability specification, explanation, and adaptive system refinement. We elaborate and apply the concept of Value-Aligned Operational Design Domains (VODDs) to structure autonomy in accordance with contextual value priorities. Our approach shifts the emphasis from solving moral dilemmas at runtime to anticipating and structuring value-sensitive behaviour during development.

Abstract: Speech disfluencies play a role in perspective-taking and audience design in human-human communication (HHC), but little is known about their impact in human-machine dialogue (HMD). In an online Namer-Matcher task, sixty-one participants interacted with a speech agent using either fluent or disfluent speech. Participants completed a partner-modelling questionnaire (PMQ) both before and after the task. Post-interaction evaluations indicated that participants perceived the disfluent agent as more competent, despite no significant differences in pre-task ratings. However, no notable differences were observed in assessments of conversational flexibility or human-likeness. Our findings also reveal evidence of egocentric and allocentric language production when participants interact with speech agents. Interaction with disfluent speech agents appears to increase egocentric communication in comparison to fluent agents. Although the wide credibility intervals mean this effect is not clear-cut. We discuss potential interpretations of this finding, focusing on how disfluencies may impact partner models and language production in HMD.

<title>Remembering the Markov Property in Cooperative MARL</title>

arXiv:2507.18333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP), where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory. Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents. Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence, enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored. To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

Abstract: Effective human-AI collaboration for physical task completion has significant potential in both everyday activities and professional domains. AI agents equipped with informative guidance can enhance human performance, but evaluating such collaboration remains challenging due to the complexity of human-in-the-loop interactions. In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework and a multimodal dataset of human-AI interactions designed to assess how AI guidance affects procedural task performance, error reduction and learning outcomes. Besides, we develop an augmented reality (AR)-equipped AI agent that provides interactive guidance in real-world tasks, from cooking to battlefield medicine. Through human studies, we share empirical insights into AI-assisted human performance and demonstrate that AI-assisted collaboration improves task completion.

<title>Delving into Mapping Uncertainty for Mapless Trajectory Prediction</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches, where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data, reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight, self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6% improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Ethan-Zheng136/Map-Uncertainty-for-Trajectory-Prediction.

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences. However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design. Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool. Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona agents' perspectives.

Abstract: Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects (e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly, requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2) invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to comparable non-invariant architectures.

<title>Explainable Mapper: Charting LLM Embedding Spaces Using Perturbation-Based Explanation and Verification Agents</title>

arXiv:2507.18607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce high-dimensional embeddings that capture rich semantic and syntactic relationships between words, sentences, and concepts. Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via mapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures. Specifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the embedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood (containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their corresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these embedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable human effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for semi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the exploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a mapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The annotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable LLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated analysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of mapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We instantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate its effectiveness through case studies. In particular, we replicate findings from prior research on BERT's embedding properties across various layers of its architecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of topological neighborhoods.

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce \textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS (Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

<title>Hybrid Reward-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Quantum Circuit Synthesis</title>

Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static, domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit optimization.

<title>From Individual Learning to Market Equilibrium: Correcting Structural and Parametric Biases in RL Simulations of Economic Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18229</link>

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic systems within the broader domain of computational social science.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hierarchical framework for portfolio optimization, integrating lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to combine sentiment signals from financial news with traditional market indicators. Our three-tier architecture employs base RL agents to process hybrid data, meta-agents to aggregate their decisions, and a super-agent to merge decisions based on market data and sentiment analysis. Evaluated on data from 2018 to 2024, after training on 2000-2017, the framework achieves a 26% annualized return and a Sharpe ratio of 1.2, outperforming equal-weighted and S&amp;P 500 benchmarks. Key contributions include scalable cross-modal integration, a hierarchical RL structure for enhanced stability, and open-source reproducibility.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything communications-assisted autonomous driving has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, with pragmatic communications (PragComm) emerging as a promising paradigm for real-time collaboration among vehicles and other agents. Simultaneously, extensive research has explored the interplay between collaborative perception and decision-making in end-to-end driving frameworks. In this work, we revisit the collaborative driving problem and propose the Select2Drive framework to optimize the utilization of limited computational and communication resources. Particularly, to mitigate cumulative latency in perception and decision-making, Select2Drive introduces distributed predictive perception by formulating an active prediction paradigm and simplifying high-dimensional semantic feature prediction into a computation cost-efficient, motion-aware reconstruction. Given the ``less is more" principle that an over-broadened perceptual horizon possibly confuses the decision module rather than contributing to it, Select2Drive utilizes area-of-importance-based PragComm to prioritize the communications of critical regions, thus boosting both communication efficiency and decision-making efficacy. Empirical evaluations on the V2Xverse and real-world DAIR-V2X demonstrate that Select2Drive achieves a $2.60$\% and $1.99$\% improvement in offline perception tasks under limited bandwidth (resp., pose error conditions). Moreover, it delivers at most $8.35$\% and $2.65$\% enhancement in closed-loop driving scores and route completion rates, particularly in scenarios characterized by dense traffic and high-speed dynamics.

Abstract: This paper studies an online variant of the celebrated housing market problem, where each agent has a single house and seeks to exchange it for another based on her preferences. In this online setting, agents may arrive and depart at any time, meaning that not all agents are present on the housing market simultaneously. I extend the well known serial dictatorship and Gale s top trading cycle mechanisms to this online scenario, aiming to retain their desirable properties such as Pareto efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy proofness. These extensions also seek to prevent agents from strategically delaying their arrival or advancing their departure. I demonstrate that achieving all of these properties simultaneously is impossible in the online context, and I present several variants that achieve different subsets of these properties.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) shows great potential for optimizing multi-vehicle cooperative driving strategies through the state-action-reward feedback loop, but it still faces challenges such as low sample efficiency. This paper proposes a differentiated reward method based on steady-state transition systems, which incorporates state transition gradient information into the reward design by analyzing traffic flow characteristics, aiming to optimize action selection and policy learning in multi-vehicle cooperative decision-making. The performance of the proposed method is validated in RL algorithms such as MAPPO, MADQN, and QMIX under varying autonomous vehicle penetration. The results show that the differentiated reward method significantly accelerates training convergence and outperforms centering reward and others in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, and action rationality. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong scalability and environmental adaptability, providing a novel approach for multi-agent cooperative decision-making in complex traffic scenarios.

Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), applying large language models (LLMs) to Operations Research (OR) problem-solving has attracted increasing attention. Most existing approaches attempt to improve OR problem-solving through prompt engineering or fine-tuning strategies for LLMs. However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the limited capabilities of non-reasoning LLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose OR-LLM-Agent, an AI agent built on reasoning LLMs for automated OR problem solving. The agent decomposes the task into three sequential stages: mathematical modeling, code generation, and debugging. Each task is handled by a dedicated sub-agent, which enables more targeted reasoning. We also construct BWOR, a high-quality dataset for evaluating LLM performance on OR tasks. Our analysis shows that existing benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR suffer from certain issues, making them less suitable for reliably evaluating LLM performance. In contrast, BWOR provides a more consistent and discriminative assessment of model capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that OR-LLM-Agent outperforms advanced methods, including GPT-o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and ORLM, by at least 7% in accuracy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of task decomposition for OR problem solving.

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the significance of natural language in enhancing the controllability of generative models. While various efforts have been made to leverage natural language for content generation, research on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents utilizing text-based instructions for procedural content generation remains limited. In this paper, we propose IPCGRL, an instruction-based procedural content generation method via reinforcement learning, which incorporates a sentence embedding model. IPCGRL fine-tunes task-specific embedding representations to effectively compress game-level conditions. We evaluate IPCGRL in a two-dimensional level generation task and compare its performance with a general-purpose embedding method. The results indicate that IPCGRL achieves up to a 21.4% improvement in controllability and a 17.2% improvement in generalizability for unseen instructions. Furthermore, the proposed method extends the modality of conditional input, enabling a more flexible and expressive interaction framework for procedural content generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as educational tools, yet evaluating their teaching capabilities remains challenging due to the resource-intensive, context-dependent, and methodologically complex nature of teacher-student interactions. We introduce EducationQ, a multi-agent dialogue framework that efficiently assesses teaching capabilities through simulated dynamic educational scenarios, featuring specialized agents for teaching, learning, and evaluation. Testing 14 LLMs across major AI Organizations (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and others) on 1,498 questions spanning 13 disciplines and 10 difficulty levels reveals that teaching effectiveness does not correlate linearly with model scale or general reasoning capabilities - with some smaller open-source models outperforming larger commercial counterparts in teaching contexts. This finding highlights a critical gap in current evaluations that prioritize knowledge recall over interactive pedagogy. Our mixed-methods evaluation, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis and expert case studies, identifies distinct pedagogical strengths employed by top-performing models (e.g., sophisticated questioning strategies, adaptive feedback mechanisms). Human expert evaluations show 78% agreement with our automated qualitative analysis of effective teaching behaviors, validating our methodology. EducationQ demonstrates that LLMs-as-teachers require specialized optimization beyond simple scaling, suggesting next-generation educational AI prioritize targeted enhancement of specific pedagogical effectiveness.

Abstract: The AI alignment problem, which focusses on ensuring that artificial intelligence (AI), including AGI and ASI, systems act according to human values, presents profound challenges. With the progression from narrow AI to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence, fears about control and existential risk have escalated. Here, we investigate whether embracing inevitable AI misalignment can be a contingent strategy to foster a dynamic ecosystem of competing agents as a viable path to steer them in more human-aligned trends and mitigate risks. We explore how misalignment may serve and should be promoted as a counterbalancing mechanism to team up with whichever agents are most aligned to human interests, ensuring that no single system dominates destructively. The main premise of our contribution is that misalignment is inevitable because full AI-human alignment is a mathematical impossibility from Turing-complete systems, which we also offer as a proof in this contribution, a feature then inherited to AGI and ASI systems. We introduce a change-of-opinion attack test based on perturbation and intervention analysis to study how humans and agents may change or neutralise friendly and unfriendly AIs through cooperation and competition. We show that open models are more diverse and that most likely guardrails implemented in proprietary models are successful at controlling some of the agents' range of behaviour with positive and negative consequences while closed systems are more steerable and can also be used against proprietary AI systems. We also show that human and AI intervention has different effects hence suggesting multiple strategies.

Abstract: This paper investigates a joint beamforming and resource allocation problem in downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to minimize the average delay, where data packets for each user arrive at the base station (BS) stochastically. The sequential optimization problem is inherently a Markov decision process (MDP), thus falling within the remit of reinforcement learning. To effectively handle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically, proximal policy optimization (PPO)-Theta is employed to optimize the RIS phase shift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions. The active beamforming at the BS is then derived from the jointly optimized RIS phase shifts and subcarrier allocation decisions. To further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier allocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize the subcarrier allocation indicators more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive resource allocation and accurately capture the network dynamics, key factors closely related to average delay, such as the number of backlogged packets in buffers and current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space. Furthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance the training efficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the average delay, enhances resource allocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment, robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM agents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled the development of mobile agents that can understand visual inputs and follow user instructions, unlocking new possibilities for automating complex tasks on mobile devices. However, applying these models to real-world mobile scenarios remains a significant challenge due to the long-horizon task execution, difficulty in error recovery, and the cold-start problem in unfamiliar environments. To address these challenges, we propose MobileUse, a GUI agent designed for robust and adaptive mobile task execution. To improve resilience in long-horizon tasks and dynamic environments, we introduce a hierarchical reflection architecture that enables the agent to self-monitor, detect, and recover from errors across multiple temporal scales-ranging from individual actions to overall task completion-while maintaining efficiency through a reflection-on-demand strategy. To tackle cold-start issues, we further introduce a proactive exploration module, which enriches the agent's understanding of the environment through self-planned exploration. Evaluations on AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks demonstrate that MobileUse establishes new state-of-the-art performance, achieving success rates of 62.9% and 44.2%, respectively. To facilitate real-world applications, we release an out-of-the-box toolkit for automated task execution on physical mobile devices, which is available at https://github.com/MadeAgents/mobile-use.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning is a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence, with applications ranging from mathematical problem-solving to decision-making in dynamic environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in enabling agents to perform multi-step reasoning by optimizing long-term rewards. However, conventional RL methods struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to issues such as credit assignment, high-dimensional state representations, and stability concerns. Recent advancements in Transformer architectures and hyperbolic geometry have provided novel solutions to these challenges. This paper introduces a new framework that integrates hyperbolic Transformers into RL for multi-step reasoning. The proposed approach leverages hyperbolic embeddings to model hierarchical structures effectively. We present theoretical insights, algorithmic details, and experimental results that include Frontier Math and nonlinear optimal control problems. Compared to RL with vanilla transformer, the hyperbolic RL largely improves accuracy by (32%~44%) on FrontierMath benchmark, (43%~45%) on nonlinear optimal control benchmark, while achieving impressive reduction in computational time by (16%~32%) on FrontierMath benchmark, (16%~17%) on nonlinear optimal control benchmark. Our work demonstrates the potential of hyperbolic Transformers in reinforcement learning, particularly for multi-step reasoning tasks that involve hierarchical structures.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) is the problem of finding paths for a set of agents such that each agent reaches its desired destination while avoiding collisions with the other agents. Many MAPF solvers are designed to run offline, that is, first generate paths for all agents and then execute them. Real-Time MAPF (RT-MAPF) embodies a realistic MAPF setup in which one cannot wait until a complete path for each agent has been found before they start to move. Instead, planning and execution are interleaved, where the agents must commit to a fixed number of steps in a constant amount of computation time, referred to as the planning budget. Existing solutions to RT-MAPF iteratively call windowed versions of MAPF algorithms in every planning period, without explicitly considering the size of the planning budget. We address this gap and explore different policies for allocating the planning budget in windowed versions of standard MAPF algorithms, namely Prioritized Planning (PrP) and MAPF-LNS2. Our exploration shows that the baseline approach in which all agents draw from a shared planning budget pool is ineffective in over-constrained situations. Instead, policies that distribute the planning budget over the agents are able to solve more problems with a smaller makespan.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed a paradigm shift from static prediction systems to agentic AI agents capable of reasoning, interacting with tools, and adapting to complex tasks. While LLM-based agentic systems have shown promise across many domains, their application to medical imaging remains in its infancy. In this work, we introduce AURA, the first visual linguistic explainability agent designed specifically for comprehensive analysis, explanation, and evaluation of medical images. By enabling dynamic interactions, contextual explanations, and hypothesis testing, AURA represents a significant advancement toward more transparent, adaptable, and clinically aligned AI systems. We highlight the promise of agentic AI in transforming medical image analysis from static predictions to interactive decision support. Leveraging Qwen-32B, an LLM-based architecture, AURA integrates a modular toolbox comprising: (i) a segmentation suite with phase grounding, pathology segmentation, and anatomy segmentation to localize clinically meaningful regions; (ii) a counterfactual image-generation module that supports reasoning through image-level explanations; and (iii) a set of evaluation tools including pixel-wise difference-map analysis, classification, and advanced state-of-the-art components to assess diagnostic relevance and visual interpretability.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) environment for developing an autonomous underwater robotic coral sampling agent, a crucial coral reef conservation and research task. Using software-in-the-loop (SIL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL), an RL-trained artificial intelligence (AI) controller is developed using a digital twin (DT) in simulation and subsequently verified in physical experiments. An underwater motion capture (MOCAP) system provides real-time 3D position and orientation feedback during verification testing for precise synchronization between the digital and physical domains. A key novelty of this approach is the combined use of a general-purpose game engine for simulation, deep RL, and real-time underwater motion capture for an effective zero-shot sim-to-real strategy.

<title>Text-to-SPARQL Goes Beyond English: Multilingual Question Answering Over Knowledge Graphs through Human-Inspired Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Accessing knowledge via multilingual natural-language interfaces is one of the emerging challenges in the field of information retrieval and related ones. Structured knowledge stored in knowledge graphs can be queried via a specific query language (e.g., SPARQL). Therefore, one needs to transform natural-language input into a query to fulfill an information need. Prior approaches mostly focused on combining components (e.g., rule-based or neural-based) that solve downstream tasks and come up with an answer at the end. We introduce mKGQAgent, a human-inspired framework that breaks down the task of converting natural language questions into SPARQL queries into modular, interpretable subtasks. By leveraging a coordinated LLM agent workflow for planning, entity linking, and query refinement - guided by an experience pool for in-context learning - mKGQAgent efficiently handles multilingual KGQA. Evaluated on the DBpedia- and Corporate-based KGQA benchmarks within the Text2SPARQL challenge 2025, our approach took first place among the other participants. This work opens new avenues for developing human-like reasoning systems in multilingual semantic parsing.

<title>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework for Adaptive Walking Control Using General Value Functions of Lower-Limb Sensor Signals</title>

Abstract: Rehabilitation technology is a natural setting to study the shared learning and decision-making of human and machine agents. In this work, we explore the use of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) to develop adaptive control strategies for lower-limb exoskeletons, aiming to enhance mobility and autonomy for individuals with motor impairments. Inspired by prominent models of biological sensorimotor processing, our investigated HRL approach breaks down the complex task of exoskeleton control adaptation into a higher-level framework for terrain strategy adaptation and a lower-level framework for providing predictive information; this latter element is implemented via the continual learning of general value functions (GVFs). GVFs generated temporal abstractions of future signal values from multiple wearable lower-limb sensors, including electromyography, pressure insoles, and goniometers. We investigated two methods for incorporating actual and predicted sensor signals into a policy network with the intent to improve the decision-making capacity of the control system of a lower-limb exoskeleton during ambulation across varied terrains. As a key result, we found that the addition of predictions made from GVFs increased overall network accuracy. Terrain-specific performance increases were seen while walking on even ground, uneven ground, up and down ramps, and turns, terrains that are often misclassified without predictive information. This suggests that predictive information can aid decision-making during uncertainty, e.g., on terrains that have a high chance of being misclassified. This work, therefore, contributes new insights into the nuances of HRL and the future development of exoskeletons to facilitate safe transitioning and traversing across different walking environments.

Abstract: Interest in sustainability information has surged in recent years. However, the data required for a life cycle assessment (LCA) that maps the materials and processes from product manufacturing to disposal into environmental impacts (EI) are often unavailable. Here we reimagine conventional LCA by introducing multimodal AI agents that emulate interactions between LCA experts and stakeholders like product managers and engineers to calculate the cradle-to-gate (production) carbon emissions of electronic devices. The AI agents iteratively generate a detailed life-cycle inventory leveraging a custom data abstraction and software tools that extract information from online text and images from repair communities and government certifications. This approach reduces weeks or months of expert time to under one minute and closes data availability gaps while yielding carbon footprint estimates within 19% of expert LCAs with zero proprietary data. Additionally, we develop a method to directly estimate EI by comparing an input to a cluster of products with similar descriptions and known carbon footprints. This runs in 3 ms on a laptop with a MAPE of 12.28% on electronic products. Further, we develop a data-driven method to generate emission factors. We use the properties of an unknown material to represent it as a weighted sum of emission factors for similar materials. Compared to human experts picking the closest LCA database entry, this improves MAPE by 120.26%. We analyze the data and compute scaling of this approach and discuss its implications for future LCA workflows.

<title>Can External Validation Tools Improve Annotation Quality for LLM-as-a-Judge?</title>

Abstract: Pairwise preferences over model responses are widely collected to evaluate and provide feedback to large language models (LLMs). Given two alternative model responses to the same input, a human or AI annotator selects the "better" response. This approach can provide feedback for domains where other hard-coded metrics are difficult to obtain (e.g., chat response quality), thereby helping model evaluation or training. However, for some domains high-quality pairwise comparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans. For example, for responses with many factual statements, annotators may disproportionately weigh writing quality rather than underlying facts. In this work, we explore augmenting standard AI annotator systems with additional tools to improve performance on three challenging response domains: long-form factual, math and code tasks. We propose a tool-using agentic system to provide higher quality feedback on these domains. Our system uses web-search and code execution to ground itself based on external validation, independent of the LLM's internal knowledge and biases. We provide extensive experimental results evaluating our method across the three targeted response domains as well as general annotation tasks, using RewardBench (incl. AlpacaEval and LLMBar), RewardMath, as well as three new datasets for domains with saturated pre-existing datasets. Our results indicate that external tools can indeed improve performance in many, but not all, cases. More generally, our experiments highlight the sensitivity of performance to simple parameters (e.g., prompt) and the need for improved (non-saturated) annotator benchmarks. We share our code at https://github.com/apple/ml-agent-evaluator.

<title>Evaluating Uncertainty and Quality of Visual Language Action-enabled Robots</title>

Abstract: Visual Language Action (VLA) models are a multi-modal class of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that integrate visual perception, natural language understanding, and action planning to enable agents to interpret their environment, comprehend instructions, and perform embodied tasks autonomously. Recently, significant progress has been made to advance this field. These kinds of models are typically evaluated through task success rates, which fail to capture the quality of task execution and the mode's confidence in its decisions. In this paper, we propose eight uncertainty metrics and five quality metrics specifically designed for VLA models for robotic manipulation tasks. We assess their effectiveness through a large-scale empirical study involving 908 successful task executions from three state-of-the-art VLA models across four representative robotic manipulation tasks. Human domain experts manually labeled task quality, allowing us to analyze the correlation between our proposed metrics and expert judgments. The results reveal that several metrics show moderate to strong correlation with human assessments, highlighting their utility for evaluating task quality and model confidence. Furthermore, we found that some of the metrics can discriminate between high-, medium-, and low-quality executions from unsuccessful tasks, which can be interesting when test oracles are not available. Our findings challenge the adequacy of current evaluation practices that rely solely on binary success rates and pave the way for improved real-time monitoring and adaptive enhancement of VLA-enabled robotic systems.

<title>New Mechanisms in Flex Distribution for Bounded Suboptimal Multi-Agent Path Finding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17054</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.17054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of finding a set of collision-free paths, one for each agent in a shared environment. Its objective is to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent is defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location. Explicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for bounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a user-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and a lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of paths whose SOC is at most $w \cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve collisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its optimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually bounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower bound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up EECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though EECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution, increasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \cdot LB$, forcing EECBS to switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a particular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue, we propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion to the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy constraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution. On top of that, we propose Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, combining both in a hierarchical framework. We prove that EECBS with our new flex distribution mechanisms is complete and bounded-suboptimal. Our experiments show that our approaches outperform the original (greedy) flex distribution.

Abstract: Smart electric wheelchairs can improve user experience by supporting the driver with shared control. State-of-the-art work showed the potential of shared control in improving safety in navigation for non-holonomic robots. However, for holonomic systems, current approaches often lead to unintuitive behavior for the user and fail to utilize the full potential of omnidirectional driving. Therefore, we propose a reinforcement learning-based method, which takes a 2D user input and outputs a 3D motion while ensuring user comfort and reducing cognitive load on the driver. Our approach is trained in Isaac Gym and tested in simulation in Gazebo. We compare different RL agent architectures and reward functions based on metrics considering cognitive load and user comfort. We show that our method ensures collision-free navigation while smartly orienting the wheelchair and showing better or competitive smoothness compared to a previous non-learning-based method. We further perform a sim-to-real transfer and demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first real-world implementation of RL-based shared control for an omnidirectional mobility platform.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown increasing promise for collaborative task completion. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static workflows, fixed roles, and limited inter-agent communication, reducing their effectiveness in open-ended, high-complexity domains. This paper proposes a coordination framework that enables adaptiveness through three core mechanisms: dynamic task routing, bidirectional feedback, and parallel agent evaluation. The framework allows agents to reallocate tasks based on confidence and workload, exchange structured critiques to iteratively improve outputs, and crucially compete on high-ambiguity subtasks with evaluator-driven selection of the most suitable result. We instantiate these principles in a modular architecture and demonstrate substantial improvements in factual coverage, coherence, and efficiency over static and partially adaptive baselines. Our findings highlight the benefits of incorporating both adaptiveness and structured competition in multi-agent LLM systems.

<title>VL-CLIP: Enhancing Multimodal Recommendations via Visual Grounding and LLM-Augmented CLIP Embeddings</title>

arXiv:2507.17080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a critical role in e-commerce recommendation platforms today, enabling accurate recommendations and product understanding. However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness, and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by 15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust multimodal recommendations.

Abstract: Manipulating clusters of deformable objects presents a substantial challenge with widespread applicability, but requires contact-rich whole-arm interactions. A potential solution must address the limited capacity for realistic model synthesis, high uncertainty in perception, and the lack of efficient spatial abstractions, among others. We propose a novel framework for learning model-free policies integrating two modalities: 3D point clouds and proprioceptive touch indicators, emphasising manipulation with full body contact awareness, going beyond traditional end-effector modes. Our reinforcement learning framework leverages a distributional state representation, aided by kernel mean embeddings, to achieve improved training efficiency and real-time inference. Furthermore, we propose a novel context-agnostic occlusion heuristic to clear deformables from a target region for exposure tasks. We deploy the framework in a power line clearance scenario and observe that the agent generates creative strategies leveraging multiple arm links for de-occlusion. Finally, we perform zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer, allowing the arm to clear real branches with unknown occlusion patterns, unseen topology, and uncertain dynamics.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often struggle in environments where rules and required domain knowledge frequently change, such as regulatory compliance and user risk screening. Current approaches, like offline fine-tuning and standard prompting, are insufficient because they cannot effectively adapt to new knowledge during actual operation. To address this limitation, we propose the Adaptive Reflective Interactive Agent (ARIA), an LLM agent framework designed specifically to continuously learn updated domain knowledge at test time. ARIA assesses its own uncertainty through structured self-dialogue, proactively identifying knowledge gaps and requesting targeted explanations or corrections from human experts. It then systematically updates an internal, timestamped knowledge repository with provided human guidance, detecting and resolving conflicting or outdated knowledge through comparisons and clarification queries. We evaluate ARIA on the realistic customer due diligence name screening task on TikTok Pay, alongside publicly available dynamic knowledge tasks. Results demonstrate significant improvements in adaptability and accuracy compared to baselines using standard offline fine-tuning and existing self-improving agents. ARIA is deployed within TikTok Pay serving over 150 million monthly active users, confirming its practicality and effectiveness for operational use in rapidly evolving environments.

Abstract: Global health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have exposed critical weaknesses in traditional medical supply chains, including inefficiencies in resource allocation, lack of transparency, and poor adaptability to dynamic disruptions. This paper presents a novel hybrid framework that integrates blockchain technology with a decentralized, large language model (LLM) powered multi-agent negotiation system to enhance the resilience and accountability of medical supply chains during crises. In this system, autonomous agents-representing manufacturers, distributors, and healthcare institutions-engage in structured, context-aware negotiation and decision-making processes facilitated by LLMs, enabling rapid and ethical allocation of scarce medical resources. The off-chain agent layer supports adaptive reasoning and local decision-making, while the on-chain blockchain layer ensures immutable, transparent, and auditable enforcement of decisions via smart contracts. The framework also incorporates a formal cross-layer communication protocol to bridge decentralized negotiation with institutional enforcement. A simulation environment emulating pandemic scenarios evaluates the system's performance, demonstrating improvements in negotiation efficiency, fairness of allocation, supply chain responsiveness, and auditability. This research contributes an innovative approach that synergizes blockchain trust guarantees with the adaptive intelligence of LLM-driven agents, providing a robust and scalable solution for critical supply chain coordination under uncertainty.

Abstract: Predicting the future motion of road participants is a critical task in autonomous driving. In this work, we address the challenge of low-quality generation of low-probability modes in multi-agent joint prediction. To tackle this issue, we propose a two-stage multi-agent interactive prediction framework named \textit{keypoint-guided joint prediction after classification-aware marginal proposal} (JAM). The first stage is modeled as a marginal prediction process, which classifies queries by trajectory type to encourage the model to learn all categories of trajectories, providing comprehensive mode information for the joint prediction module. The second stage is modeled as a joint prediction process, which takes the scene context and the marginal proposals from the first stage as inputs to learn the final joint distribution. We explicitly introduce key waypoints to guide the joint prediction module in better capturing and leveraging the critical information from the initial predicted trajectories. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world Waymo Open Motion Dataset interactive prediction benchmark. The results show that our approach achieves competitive performance. In particular, in the framework comparison experiments, the proposed JAM outperforms other prediction frameworks and achieves state-of-the-art performance in interactive trajectory prediction. The code is available at https://github.com/LinFunster/JAM to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the behavior of large-scale multi-agents in games remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent systems. This paper examines the role of heterogeneity in equilibrium formation by analyzing how smooth regret-matching drives a large number of heterogeneous agents with diverse initial policies toward unified behavior. By modeling the system state as a probability distribution of regrets and analyzing its evolution through the continuity equation, we uncover a key phenomenon in diverse multi-agent settings: the variance of the regret distribution diminishes over time, leading to the disappearance of heterogeneity and the emergence of consensus among agents. This universal result enables us to prove convergence to quantal response equilibria in both competitive and cooperative multi-agent settings. Our work advances the theoretical understanding of multi-agent learning and offers a novel perspective on equilibrium selection in diverse game-theoretic scenarios.

Abstract: The booming development of AI agents presents unprecedented opportunities for automating complex tasks across various domains. However, their multi-step, multi-tool collaboration capabilities in the financial sector remain underexplored. This paper introduces FinGAIA, an end-to-end benchmark designed to evaluate the practical abilities of AI agents in the financial domain. FinGAIA comprises 407 meticulously crafted tasks, spanning seven major financial sub-domains: securities, funds, banking, insurance, futures, trusts, and asset management. These tasks are organized into three hierarchical levels of scenario depth: basic business analysis, asset decision support, and strategic risk management. We evaluated 10 mainstream AI agents in a zero-shot setting. The best-performing agent, ChatGPT, achieved an overall accuracy of 48.9\%, which, while superior to non-professionals, still lags financial experts by over 35 percentage points. Error analysis has revealed five recurring failure patterns: Cross-modal Alignment Deficiency, Financial Terminological Bias, Operational Process Awareness Barrier, among others. These patterns point to crucial directions for future research. Our work provides the first agent benchmark closely related to the financial domain, aiming to objectively assess and promote the development of agents in this crucial field.

Abstract: This work tackles the physical layer security (PLS) problem of maximizing the secrecy rate in heterogeneous UAV networks (HetUAVNs) under propulsion energy constraints. Unlike prior studies that assume uniform UAV capabilities or overlook energy-security trade-offs, we consider a realistic scenario where UAVs with diverse payloads and computation resources collaborate to serve ground terminals in the presence of eavesdroppers. To manage the complex coupling between UAV motion and communication, we propose a hierarchical optimization framework. The inner layer uses a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based S2DC algorithm combining penalty functions and difference-of-convex (d.c.) programming to solve the secrecy precoding problem with fixed UAV positions. The outer layer introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided heuristic multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (LLM-HeMARL) for trajectory optimization. LLM-HeMARL efficiently incorporates expert heuristics policy generated by the LLM, enabling UAVs to learn energy-aware, security-driven trajectories without the inference overhead of real-time LLM calls. The simulation results show that our method outperforms existing baselines in secrecy rate and energy efficiency, with consistent robustness across varying UAV swarm sizes and random seeds.

Abstract: Central to agentic capability and trustworthiness of language model agents (LMAs) is the extent they maintain stable, reliable, identity over time. However, LMAs inherit pathologies from large language models (LLMs) (statelessness, stochasticity, sensitivity to prompts and linguistically-intermediation) which can undermine their identifiability, continuity, persistence and consistency. This attrition of identity can erode their reliability, trustworthiness and utility by interfering with their agentic capabilities such as reasoning, planning and action. To address these challenges, we introduce \textit{agent identity evals} (AIE), a rigorous, statistically-driven, empirical framework for measuring the degree to which an LMA system exhibit and maintain their agentic identity over time, including their capabilities, properties and ability to recover from state perturbations. AIE comprises a set of novel metrics which can integrate with other measures of performance, capability and agentic robustness to assist in the design of optimal LMA infrastructure and scaffolding such as memory and tools. We set out formal definitions and methods that can be applied at each stage of the LMA life-cycle, and worked examples of how to apply them.

Abstract: Analyzing large, complex output datasets from Discrete Event Simulations (DES) of warehouse operations to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies is a critical yet challenging task, often demanding significant manual effort or specialized analytical tools. Our framework integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to analyze complex Discrete Event Simulation (DES) output data from warehouse operations. It transforms raw DES data into a semantically rich KG, capturing relationships between simulation events and entities. An LLM-based agent uses iterative reasoning, generating interdependent sub-questions. For each sub-question, it creates Cypher queries for KG interaction, extracts information, and self-reflects to correct errors. This adaptive, iterative, and self-correcting process identifies operational issues mimicking human analysis. Our DES approach for warehouse bottleneck identification, tested with equipment breakdowns and process irregularities, outperforms baseline methods. For operational questions, it achieves near-perfect pass rates in pinpointing inefficiencies. For complex investigative questions, we demonstrate its superior diagnostic ability to uncover subtle, interconnected issues. This work bridges simulation modeling and AI (KG+LLM), offering a more intuitive method for actionable insights, reducing time-to-insight, and enabling automated warehouse inefficiency evaluation and diagnosis.

<title>Compliance Brain Assistant: Conversational Agentic AI for Assisting Compliance Tasks in Enterprise Environments</title>

Abstract: This paper presents Compliance Brain Assistant (CBA), a conversational, agentic AI assistant designed to boost the efficiency of daily compliance tasks for personnel in enterprise environments. To strike a good balance between response quality and latency, we design a user query router that can intelligently choose between (i) FastTrack mode: to handle simple requests that only need additional relevant context retrieved from knowledge corpora; and (ii) FullAgentic mode: to handle complicated requests that need composite actions and tool invocations to proactively discover context across various compliance artifacts, and/or involving other APIs/models for accommodating requests. A typical example would be to start with a user query, use its description to find a specific entity and then use the entity's information to query other APIs for curating and enriching the final AI response.
  Our experimental evaluations compared CBA against an out-of-the-box LLM on various real-world privacy/compliance-related queries targeting various personas. We found that CBA substantially improved upon the vanilla LLM's performance on metrics such as average keyword match rate (83.7% vs. 41.7%) and LLM-judge pass rate (82.0% vs. 20.0%). We also compared metrics for the full routing-based design against the `fast-track only` and `full-agentic` modes and found that it had a better average match-rate and pass-rate while keeping the run-time approximately the same. This finding validated our hypothesis that the routing mechanism leads to a good trade-off between the two worlds.

Abstract: Modern Earth science is at an inflection point. The vast, fragmented, and complex nature of Earth system data, coupled with increasingly sophisticated analytical demands, creates a significant bottleneck for rapid scientific discovery. Here we introduce EarthLink, the first AI agent designed as an interactive copilot for Earth scientists. It automates the end-to-end research workflow, from planning and code generation to multi-scenario analysis. Unlike static diagnostic tools, EarthLink can learn from user interaction, continuously refining its capabilities through a dynamic feedback loop. We validated its performance on a number of core scientific tasks of climate change, ranging from model-observation comparisons to the diagnosis of complex phenomena. In a multi-expert evaluation, EarthLink produced scientifically sound analyses and demonstrated an analytical competency that was rated as comparable to specific aspects of a human junior researcher's workflow. Additionally, its transparent, auditable workflows and natural language interface empower scientists to shift from laborious manual execution to strategic oversight and hypothesis generation. EarthLink marks a pivotal step towards an efficient, trustworthy, and collaborative paradigm for Earth system research in an era of accelerating global change.

Abstract: Motion forecasting and planning are tasked with estimating the trajectories of traffic agents and the ego vehicle, respectively, to ensure the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments. State-of-the-art methods typically adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm, where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-mode trajectories. While this paradigm can produce diverse motion intentions, it often falls short in modeling the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of trajectories, which can lead to collisions or suboptimal outcomes. To overcome this limitation, we propose DeMo++, a framework that decouples motion estimation into two distinct components: holistic motion intentions to capture the diverse potential directions of movement, and fine spatiotemporal states to track the agent's dynamic progress within the scene and enable a self-refinement capability. Further, we introduce a cross-scene trajectory interaction mechanism to explore the relationships between motions in adjacent scenes. This allows DeMo++ to comprehensively model both the diversity of motion intentions and the spatiotemporal evolution of each trajectory. To effectively implement this framework, we developed a hybrid model combining Attention and Mamba. This architecture leverages the strengths of both mechanisms for efficient scene information aggregation and precise trajectory state sequence modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMo++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including motion forecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and end-to-end planning (NAVSIM).

Abstract: Multi-step agentic retrieval systems based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex information search tasks. However, these systems still face significant challenges in practical applications, particularly in generating factually inconsistent intermediate queries and inefficient search trajectories, which can lead to reasoning deviations or redundant computations. To address these issues, we propose DynaSearcher, an innovative search agent enhanced by dynamic knowledge graphs and multi-reward reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our system leverages knowledge graphs as external structured knowledge to guide the search process by explicitly modeling entity relationships, thereby ensuring factual consistency in intermediate queries and mitigating biases from irrelevant information. Furthermore, we employ a multi-reward RL framework for fine-grained control over training objectives such as retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and response quality. This framework promotes the generation of high-quality intermediate queries and comprehensive final answers, while discouraging unnecessary exploration and minimizing information omissions or redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art answer accuracy on six multi-hop question answering datasets, matching frontier LLMs while using only small-scale models and limited computational resources. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong generalization and robustness across diverse retrieval environments and larger-scale models, highlighting its broad applicability.

<title>Residual Prophet Inequalities</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.17391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a variant of the classic prophet inequality, called \emph{residual prophet inequality} (RPI). In the RPI problem, we consider a finite sequence of $n$ nonnegative independent random values with known distributions, and a known integer $0\leq k\leq n-1$. Before the gambler observes the sequence, the top $k$ values are removed, whereas the remaining $n-k$ values are streamed sequentially to the gambler. For example, one can assume that the top $k$ values have already been allocated to a higher-priority agent. Upon observing a value, the gambler must decide irrevocably whether to accept or reject it, without the possibility of revisiting past values.
  We study two variants of RPI, according to whether the gambler learns online of the identity of the variable that he sees (FI model) or not (NI model). Our main result is a randomized algorithm in the FI model with \emph{competitive ratio} of at least $1/(k+2)$, which we show is tight. Our algorithm is data-driven and requires access only to the $k+1$ largest values of a single sample from the $n$ input distributions. In the NI model, we provide a similar algorithm that guarantees a competitive ratio of $1/(2k+2)$. We further analyze independent and identically distributed instances when $k=1$. We build a single-threshold algorithm with a competitive ratio of at least 0.4901, and show that no single-threshold strategy can get a competitive ratio greater than 0.5464.

Abstract: In computed tomography (CT), achieving high image quality while minimizing radiation exposure remains a key clinical challenge. This paper presents CAPRI-CT, a novel causal-aware deep learning framework for Causal Analysis and Predictive Reasoning for Image Quality Optimization in CT imaging. CAPRI-CT integrates image data with acquisition metadata (such as tube voltage, tube current, and contrast agent types) to model the underlying causal relationships that influence image quality. An ensemble of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is employed to extract meaningful features and generate causal representations from observational data, including CT images and associated imaging parameters. These input features are fused to predict the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and support counterfactual inference, enabling what-if simulations, such as changes in contrast agents (types and concentrations) or scan parameters. CAPRI-CT is trained and validated using an ensemble learning approach, achieving strong predictive performance. By facilitating both prediction and interpretability, CAPRI-CT provides actionable insights that could help radiologists and technicians design more efficient CT protocols without repeated physical scans. The source code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/SnehaGeorge22/capri-ct.

Abstract: Participatory budgeting is a method of collectively understanding and addressing spending priorities where citizens vote on how a budget is spent, it is regularly run to improve the fairness of the distribution of public funds. Participatory budgeting requires voters to make decisions on projects which can lead to ``choice overload". A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to decision support can make decision making easier for voters by identifying voting strategies that increase the winning proportion of their vote. This novel approach can also support policymakers by highlighting aspects of election design that enable fair compromise on projects. This paper presents a novel, ethically aligned approach to decision support using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning modelling. This paper introduces a novel use of a branching neural network architecture to overcome scalability challenges of multi-agent reinforcement learning in a decentralized way. Fair compromises are found through optimising voter actions towards greater representation of voter preferences in the winning set. Experimental evaluation with real-world participatory budgeting data reveals a pattern in fair compromise: that it is achievable through projects with smaller cost.

Abstract: Detecting diverse objects within complex indoor 3D point clouds presents significant challenges for robotic perception, particularly with varied object shapes, clutter, and the co-existence of static and dynamic elements where traditional bounding box methods falter. To address these limitations, we propose IndoorBEV, a novel mask-based Bird's-Eye View (BEV) method for indoor mobile robots.
  In a BEV method, a 3D scene is projected into a 2D BEV grid which handles naturally occlusions and provides a consistent top-down view aiding to distinguish static obstacles from dynamic agents. The obtained 2D BEV results is directly usable to downstream robotic tasks like navigation, motion prediction, and planning. Our architecture utilizes an axis compact encoder and a window-based backbone to extract rich spatial features from this BEV map. A query-based decoder head then employs learned object queries to concurrently predict object classes and instance masks in the BEV space. This mask-centric formulation effectively captures the footprint of both static and dynamic objects regardless of their shape, offering a robust alternative to bounding box regression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IndoorBEV on a custom indoor dataset featuring diverse object classes including static objects
  and dynamic elements like robots and miscellaneous items, showcasing its potential for robust indoor scene understanding.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence aims to combine neural architectures with symbolic approaches that can represent knowledge in a human-interpretable formalism. Continual learning concerns with agents that expand their knowledge over time, improving their skills while avoiding to forget previously learned concepts. Most of the existing approaches for neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence are applied to static scenarios only, and the challenging setting where reasoning along the temporal dimension is necessary has been seldom explored. In this work we introduce LTLZinc, a benchmarking framework that can be used to generate datasets covering a variety of different problems, against which neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods can be evaluated along the temporal and constraint-driven dimensions. Our framework generates expressive temporal reasoning and continual learning tasks from a linear temporal logic specification over MiniZinc constraints, and arbitrary image classification datasets. Fine-grained annotations allow multiple neural and neuro-symbolic training settings on the same generated datasets. Experiments on six neuro-symbolic sequence classification and four class-continual learning tasks generated by LTLZinc, demonstrate the challenging nature of temporal learning and reasoning, and highlight limitations of current state-of-the-art methods. We release the LTLZinc generator and ten ready-to-use tasks to the neuro-symbolic and continual learning communities, in the hope of fostering research towards unified temporal learning and reasoning frameworks.

<title>Simulating multiple human perspectives in socio-ecological systems using large language models</title>

Abstract: Understanding socio-ecological systems requires insights from diverse stakeholder perspectives, which are often hard to access. To enable alternative, simulation-based exploration of different stakeholder perspectives, we develop the HoPeS (Human-Oriented Perspective Shifting) modelling framework. HoPeS employs agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to represent various stakeholders; users can step into the agent roles to experience perspectival differences. A simulation protocol serves as a "scaffold" to streamline multiple perspective-taking simulations, supporting users in reflecting on, transitioning between, and integrating across perspectives. A prototype system is developed to demonstrate HoPeS in the context of institutional dynamics and land use change, enabling both narrative-driven and numerical experiments. In an illustrative experiment, a user successively adopts the perspectives of a system observer and a researcher - a role that analyses data from the embedded land use model to inform evidence-based decision-making for other LLM agents representing various institutions. Despite the user's effort to recommend technically sound policies, discrepancies persist between the policy recommendation and implementation due to stakeholders' competing advocacies, mirroring real-world misalignment between researcher and policymaker perspectives. The user's reflection highlights the subjective feelings of frustration and disappointment as a researcher, especially due to the challenge of maintaining political neutrality while attempting to gain political influence. Despite this, the user exhibits high motivation to experiment with alternative narrative framing strategies, suggesting the system's potential in exploring different perspectives. Further system and protocol refinement are likely to enable new forms of interdisciplinary collaboration in socio-ecological simulations.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents are expected to play a vital role in the evolution of 6G networks, by empowering real-time decision-making related to management and service provisioning to end-users. This shift facilitates the transition from a specialized intelligence approach, where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms handle isolated tasks, to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven networks, where agents possess broader reasoning capabilities and can manage diverse network functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with real-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic agents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty steering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers supervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and implement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network optimizers, and (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We further propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI networks and evaluate it on a 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show that symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone LLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy with a 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and in near-real-time loops of 82 ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world testbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and resource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44%. Drawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the symbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven networks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even as LLMs advance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are growingly extended to process multimodal data such as text and video simultaneously. Their remarkable performance in understanding what is shown in images is surpassing specialized neural networks (NNs) such as Yolo that is supporting only a well-formed but very limited vocabulary, ie., objects that they are able to detect. When being non-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations. This is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception systems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case situation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to either potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who are present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in reality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving systems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous decisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the performance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic situations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for capturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe that both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding capabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult to spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements in their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such as BetterCheck that we propose in our work.

Abstract: Creating aesthetically pleasing data visualizations remains challenging for users without design expertise or familiarity with visualization tools. To address this gap, we present DataWink, a system that enables users to create custom visualizations by adapting high-quality examples. Our approach combines large multimodal models (LMMs) to extract data encoding from existing SVG-based visualization examples, featuring an intermediate representation of visualizations that bridges primitive SVG and visualization programs. Users may express adaptation goals to a conversational agent and control the visual appearance through widgets generated on demand. With an interactive interface, users can modify both data mappings and visual design elements while maintaining the original visualization's aesthetic quality. To evaluate DataWink, we conduct a user study (N=12) with replication and free-form exploration tasks. As a result, DataWink is recognized for its learnability and effectiveness in personalized authoring tasks. Our results demonstrate the potential of example-driven approaches for democratizing visualization creation.

<title>Fundamental limits of distributed covariance matrix estimation via a conditional strong data processing inequality</title>

Abstract: Estimating high-dimensional covariance matrices is a key task across many fields. This paper explores the theoretical limits of distributed covariance estimation in a feature-split setting, where communication between agents is constrained. Specifically, we study a scenario in which multiple agents each observe different components of i.i.d. samples drawn from a sub-Gaussian random vector. A central server seeks to estimate the complete covariance matrix using a limited number of bits communicated by each agent. We obtain a nearly tight minimax lower bound for covariance matrix estimation under operator norm and Frobenius norm. Our main technical tool is a novel generalization of the strong data processing inequality (SDPI), termed the Conditional Strong Data Processing Inequality (C-SDPI) coefficient, introduced in this work. The C-SDPI coefficient shares key properties such as tensorization with the conventional SDPI. Crucially, it quantifies the average contraction in a state-dependent channel and can be significantly lower than the worst-case SDPI coefficient over the state input.
  Utilizing the doubling trick of Geng-Nair and an operator Jensen inequality, we compute this coefficient for Gaussian mixture channels. We then employ it to establish minimax lower bounds on estimation error, capturing the trade-offs among sample size, communication cost, and data dimensionality. Building on this, we present a nearly optimal estimation protocol whose sample and communication requirements match the lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Unlike much of the existing literature, our framework does not assume infinite samples or Gaussian distributions, making it broadly applicable. Finally, we extend our analysis to interactive protocols, showing interaction can significantly reduce communication requirements compared to non-interactive schemes.

Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology for identifying and simulating financial and economic systems using stochastically structured reservoir computers (SSRCs). The proposed framework leverages structure-preserving embeddings and graph-informed coupling matrices to model inter-agent dynamics with enhanced interpretability. A constrained optimization scheme ensures that the learned models satisfy both stochastic and structural constraints. Two empirical case studies, a dynamic behavioral model of resource competition among agents, and regional inflation network dynamics, illustrate the effectiveness of the approach in capturing and anticipating complex nonlinear patterns and enabling interpretable predictive analysis under uncertainty.

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT4 in the auto generation of code represents a significant advancement, yet it is not without its challenges. The ambiguity inherent in natural language descriptions of software poses substantial obstacles to generating deployable, structured artifacts. This research champions Model Driven Development (MDD) as a viable strategy to overcome these challenges, proposing an Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD) approach that employs GPT4 as a code generator. This approach enhances the flexibility and scalability of the code auto generation process and offers agility that allows seamless adaptation to changes in models or deployment environments. We illustrate this by modeling a multi agent Unmanned Vehicle Fleet (UVF) system using the Unified Modeling Language (UML), significantly reducing model ambiguity by integrating the Object Constraint Language (OCL) for code structure meta modeling, and the FIPA ontology language for communication semantics meta modeling. Applying GPT4 auto generation capabilities yields Java and Python code that is compatible with the JADE and PADE frameworks, respectively. Our thorough evaluation of the auto generated code verifies its alignment with expected behaviors and identifies enhancements in agent interactions. Structurally, we assessed the complexity of code derived from a model constrained solely by OCL meta models, against that influenced by both OCL and FIPA ontology meta models. The results indicate that the ontology constrained meta model produces inherently more complex code, yet its cyclomatic complexity remains within manageable levels, suggesting that additional meta model constraints can be incorporated without exceeding the high risk threshold for complexity.

<title>Learning Neural Strategy-Proof Matching Mechanism from Examples</title>

Abstract: Designing two-sided matching mechanisms is challenging when practical demands for matching outcomes are difficult to formalize and the designed mechanism must satisfy theoretical conditions. To address this, prior work has proposed a framework that learns a matching mechanism from examples, using a parameterized family that satisfies properties such as stability. However, despite its usefulness, this framework does not guarantee strategy-proofness (SP), and cannot handle varying numbers of agents or incorporate publicly available contextual information about agents, both of which are crucial in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a new parametrized family of matching mechanisms that always satisfy strategy-proofness, are applicable for an arbitrary number of agents, and deal with public contextual information of agents, based on the serial dictatorship (SD). This family is represented by NeuralSD, a novel neural network architecture based on SD, where agent rankings in SD are treated as learnable parameters computed from agents' contexts using an attention-based sub-network. To enable learning, we introduce tensor serial dictatorship (TSD), a differentiable relaxation of SD using tensor operations. This allows NeuralSD to be trained end-to-end from example matchings while satisfying SP. We conducted experiments to learn a matching mechanism from matching examples while satisfying SP. We demonstrated that our method outperformed baselines in predicting matchings and on several metrics for goodness of matching outcomes.

<title>A Coalition Game for On-demand Multi-modal 3D Automated Delivery System</title>

Abstract: We introduce a multi-modal autonomous delivery optimization framework as a coalition game for a fleet of UAVs and ADRs operating in two overlaying networks to address last-mile delivery in urban environments, including high-density areas and time-critical applications. The problem is defined as multiple depot pickup and delivery with time windows constrained over operational restrictions, such as vehicle battery limitation, precedence time window, and building obstruction. Utilizing the coalition game theory, we investigate cooperation structures among the modes to capture how strategic collaboration can improve overall routing efficiency. To do so, a generalized reinforcement learning model is designed to evaluate the cost-sharing and allocation to different modes to learn the cooperative behaviour with respect to various realistic scenarios. Our methodology leverages an end-to-end deep multi-agent policy gradient method augmented by a novel spatio-temporal adjacency neighbourhood graph attention network using a heterogeneous edge-enhanced attention model and transformer architecture. Several numerical experiments on last-mile delivery applications have been conducted, showing the results from the case study in the city of Mississauga, which shows that despite the incorporation of an extensive network in the graph for two modes and a complex training structure, the model addresses realistic operational constraints and achieves high-quality solutions compared with the existing transformer-based and classical methods. It can perform well on non-homogeneous data distribution, generalizes well on different scales and configurations, and demonstrates a robust cooperative performance under stochastic scenarios across various tasks, which is effectively reflected by coalition analysis and cost allocation to signify the advantage of cooperation.

<title>Optimizing Privacy-Utility Trade-off in Decentralized Learning with Generalized Correlated Noise</title>

Abstract: Decentralized learning enables distributed agents to collaboratively train a shared machine learning model without a central server, through local computation and peer-to-peer communication. Although each agent retains its dataset locally, sharing local models can still expose private information about the local training datasets to adversaries. To mitigate privacy attacks, a common strategy is to inject random artificial noise at each agent before exchanging local models between neighbors. However, this often leads to utility degradation due to the negative effects of cumulated artificial noise on the learning algorithm. In this work, we introduce CorN-DSGD, a novel covariance-based framework for generating correlated privacy noise across agents, which unifies several state-of-the-art methods as special cases. By leveraging network topology and mixing weights, CorN-DSGD optimizes the noise covariance to achieve network-wide noise cancellation. Experimental results show that CorN-DSGD cancels more noise than existing pairwise correlation schemes, improving model performance under formal privacy guarantees.

<title>The Learning Approach to Games</title>

Abstract: This work introduces a unified framework for a more detailed exploration of games. In existing literature, strategies of players are typically assigned scalar values, and the concept of Nash equilibrium is used to identify compatible strategies. However, this approach lacks the internal structure of a player, thereby failing to accurately model observed behaviors.
  To address this limitation, we propose an abstract definition of a player. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of players and brings the focus to the challenge of learning that players face. Unlike Markov decision processes, which formalize control problems but not agent design, our framework subsumes standard reinforcement learning structures. It thus offers a language that enables a deeper connection between games and learning. To illustrate the need for such generality, we study a simple two-player game and show that even in the most basic settings, a sophisticated player may adopt dynamic strategies that cannot be captured by simpler designs or compatibility analysis alone.
  In the discrete setting, we consider a player whose structure incorporates standard estimates from the literature. We explore connections to correlated equilibrium and highlight that dynamic programming naturally applies to all estimates. In the mean-field setting, we exploit symmetry to construct explicit examples of equilibria. Finally, we examine connections to reinforcement learning and bandit problems, demonstrating the broad applicability of the framework.

Abstract: Despite the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) across critical domains such as healthcare, customer service, and business marketing, their integration into Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) remains limited. This gap is primarily due to the absence of domain-specific foundational models, with existing solutions often relying on general-purpose LLMs that fail to address the unique challenges and technical intricacies of O-RAN. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative to develop specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN. Built on 18 models spanning five open-source LLM frameworks -- Mistral, Qwen, Llama, Phi, and Gemma -- ORANSight-2.0 fine-tunes models ranging from 1B to 70B parameters, significantly reducing reliance on proprietary, closed-source models while enhancing performance in O-RAN-specific tasks. At the core of ORANSight-2.0 is RANSTRUCT, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based instruction-tuning framework that employs two LLM agents -- a Mistral-based Question Generator and a Qwen-based Answer Generator -- to create high-quality instruction-tuning datasets. The generated dataset is then used to fine-tune the 18 pre-trained open-source LLMs via QLoRA. To evaluate ORANSight-2.0, we introduce srsRANBench, a novel benchmark designed for code generation and codebase understanding in the context of srsRAN, a widely used 5G O-RAN stack.

<title>ICCO: Learning an Instruction-conditioned Coordinator for Language-guided Task-aligned Multi-robot Control</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have permitted the development of language-guided multi-robot systems, which allow robots to execute tasks based on natural language instructions. However, achieving effective coordination in distributed multi-agent environments remains challenging due to (1) misalignment between instructions and task requirements and (2) inconsistency in robot behaviors when they independently interpret ambiguous instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Instruction-Conditioned Coordinator (ICCO), a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework designed to enhance coordination in language-guided multi-robot systems. ICCO consists of a Coordinator agent and multiple Local Agents, where the Coordinator generates Task-Aligned and Consistent Instructions (TACI) by integrating language instructions with environmental states, ensuring task alignment and behavioral consistency. The Coordinator and Local Agents are jointly trained to optimize a reward function that balances task efficiency and instruction following. A Consistency Enhancement Term is added to the learning objective to maximize mutual information between instructions and robot behaviors, further improving coordination. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of ICCO in achieving language-guided task-aligned multi-robot control. The demonstration can be found at https://yanoyoshiki.github.io/ICCO/.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) holds significant promise for adaptive traffic signal control. While existing RL-based methods demonstrate effectiveness in reducing vehicular congestion, their predominant focus on vehicle-centric optimization leaves pedestrian mobility needs and safety challenges unaddressed. In this paper, we present a deep RL framework for adaptive control of eight traffic signals along a real-world urban corridor, jointly optimizing both pedestrian and vehicular efficiency. Our single-agent policy is trained using real-world pedestrian and vehicle demand data derived from Wi-Fi logs and video analysis. The results demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional fixed-time signals, reducing average wait times per pedestrian and per vehicle by up to 67% and 52% respectively, while simultaneously decreasing total wait times for both groups by up to 67% and 53%. Additionally, our results demonstrate generalization capabilities across varying traffic demands, including conditions entirely unseen during training, validating RL's potential for developing transportation systems that serve all road users.

Abstract: We propose CRAVE (Cluster-based Retrieval Augmented Verification with Explanation); a novel framework that integrates retrieval-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) with clustering techniques to address fact-checking challenges on social media. CRAVE automatically retrieves multimodal evidence from diverse, often contradictory, sources. Evidence is clustered into coherent narratives, and evaluated via an LLM-based judge to deliver fact-checking verdicts explained by evidence summaries. By synthesizing evidence from both text and image modalities and incorporating agent-based refinement, CRAVE ensures consistency and diversity in evidence representation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate CRAVE's efficacy in retrieval precision, clustering quality, and judgment accuracy, showcasing its potential as a robust decision-support tool for fact-checkers.

Abstract: Operating robots in open-ended scenarios with diverse tasks is a crucial research and application direction in robotics. While recent progress in natural language processing and large multimodal models has enhanced robots' ability to understand complex instructions, robot manipulation still faces the procedural skill dilemma and the declarative skill dilemma in open environments. Existing methods often compromise cognitive and executive capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RoBridge, a hierarchical intelligent architecture for general robotic manipulation. It consists of a high-level cognitive planner (HCP) based on a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), an invariant operable representation (IOR) serving as a symbolic bridge, and a generalist embodied agent (GEA). RoBridge maintains the declarative skill of VLM and unleashes the procedural skill of reinforcement learning, effectively bridging the gap between cognition and execution. RoBridge demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines, achieving a 75% success rate on new tasks and an 83% average success rate in sim-to-real generalization using only five real-world data samples per task. This work represents a significant step towards integrating cognitive reasoning with physical execution in robotic systems, offering a new paradigm for general robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks requiring precise, verifiable computation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset. Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided, yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form video understanding tasks. The code has been released in https://github.com/microsoft/DeepVideoDiscovery.

Abstract: Over the past decades, cognitive neuroscientists and behavioral economists have recognized the value of describing the process of decision making in detail and modeling the emergence of decisions over time. For example, the time it takes to decide can reveal more about an agent's true hidden preferences than only the decision itself. Similarly, data that track the ongoing decision process such as eye movements or neural recordings contain critical information that can be exploited, even if no decision is made. Here, we argue that artificial intelligence (AI) research would benefit from a stronger focus on insights about how decisions emerge over time and incorporate related process data to improve AI predictions in general and human-AI interactions in particular. First, we introduce a highly established computational framework that assumes decisions to emerge from the noisy accumulation of evidence, and we present related empirical work in psychology, neuroscience, and economics. Next, we discuss to what extent current approaches in multi-agent AI do or do not incorporate process data and models of decision making. Finally, we outline how a more principled inclusion of the evidence-accumulation framework into the training and use of AI can help to improve human-AI interactions in the future.

Abstract: Segmentation of medical images is a fundamental task with numerous applications. While MRI, CT, and PET modalities have significantly benefited from deep learning segmentation techniques, more recent modalities, like functional ultrasound (fUS), have seen limited progress. fUS is a non invasive imaging method that measures changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) with high spatio-temporal resolution. However, distinguishing arterioles from venules in fUS is challenging due to opposing blood flow directions within the same pixel. Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) can enhance resolution by tracking microbubble contrast agents but is invasive, and lacks dynamic CBV quantification. In this paper, we introduce the first deep learning-based segmentation tool for fUS images, capable of differentiating signals from different vascular compartments, based on ULM automatic annotation and enabling dynamic CBV quantification. We evaluate various UNet architectures on fUS images of rat brains, achieving competitive segmentation performance, with 90% accuracy, a 71% F1 score, and an IoU of 0.59, using only 100 temporal frames from a fUS stack. These results are comparable to those from tubular structure segmentation in other imaging modalities. Additionally, models trained on resting-state data generalize well to images captured during visual stimulation, highlighting robustness. This work offers a non-invasive, cost-effective alternative to ULM, enhancing fUS data interpretation and improving understanding of vessel function. Our pipeline shows high linear correlation coefficients between signals from predicted and actual compartments in both cortical and deeper regions, showcasing its ability to accurately capture blood flow dynamics.

Abstract: Collaborative Perception (CP) has been shown to be a promising technique for multi-agent autonomous driving and multi-agent robotic systems, where multiple agents share their perception information to enhance the overall perception performance and expand the perception range. However, in CP, an ego agent needs to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-uniGuard, which is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV) segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code will be released at https://github.com/CP-Security/CP-uniGuard.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires agents to execute sequential navigation actions in complex environments guided by natural language instructions. Current approaches often struggle with generalizing to novel environments and adapting to ongoing changes during navigation. Inspired by human cognition, we present NavMorph, a self-evolving world model framework that enhances environmental understanding and decision-making in VLN-CE tasks. NavMorph employs compact latent representations to model environmental dynamics, equipping agents with foresight for adaptive planning and policy refinement. By integrating a novel Contextual Evolution Memory, NavMorph leverages scene-contextual information to support effective navigation while maintaining online adaptability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves notable performance improvements on popular VLN-CE benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/Feliciaxyao/NavMorph.

Abstract: Large language models have paved the way to powerful and flexible AI agents, assisting humans by increasingly integrating into their daily life. This flexibility, potential, and growing adoption demands a holistic and cross-disciplinary approach to developing, monitoring and discussing the capabilities required for agent-driven user experiences. However, current guidance on human-centered AI agent development is scattered: UX heuristics focus on interface behaviors, engineering taxonomies describe internal pipelines, and ethics checklists address high-level governance. There is no concise, user-facing vocabulary that tells teams what an agent should fundamentally be able to do. We introduce ADEPTS, a capability framework defining a set of core user-facing capabilities to provide unified guidance around the development of AI agents. ADEPTS is based on six principles for human-centered agent design, that express the minimal, user-facing capabilities an AI agent should demonstrate to be understandable, controllable and trustworthy in everyday use. ADEPTS complements existing frameworks and taxonomies; differently from them, it sits at the interface between technical and experience development. By presenting ADEPTS, we aim to condense complex AI-UX requirements into a compact framework that is actionable guidance for AI researchers, designers, engineers, and policy reviewers alike. We believe ADEPTS has the potential of accelerating the improvement of user-relevant agent capabilities, of easing the design of experiences that take advantage of those capabilities, and of providing a shared language to track and discuss progress around the development of AI agents.

Abstract: Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved, including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al., 2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 155 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.

Abstract: Static analyzers play a critical role in identifying bugs early in the software development lifecycle, but their rule implementations are often under-tested and prone to inconsistencies. To address this, we propose StaAgent, an agentic framework that harnesses the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically evaluate static analyzer rules. StaAgent comprises four specialized agents: a Seed Generation Agent that translates bug detection rules into concrete, bug-inducing seed programs; a Code Validation Agent that ensures the correctness of these seeds; a Mutation Generation Agent that produces semantically equivalent mutants; and an Analyzer Evaluation Agent that performs metamorphic testing by comparing the static analyzer's behavior on seeds and their corresponding mutants. By revealing inconsistent behaviors, StaAgent helps uncover flaws in rule implementations. This LLM-driven, multi-agent framework offers a scalable and adaptable solution to improve the reliability of static analyzers. We evaluated StaAgent with five state-of-the-art LLMs (CodeL-lama, DeepSeek, Codestral, Qwen, and GPT-4o) across five widely used static analyzers (SpotBugs, SonarQube, ErrorProne, Infer, and PMD). The experimental results show that our approach can help reveal 64 problematic rules in the latest versions of these five static analyzers (i.e., 28 in SpotBugs, 18 in SonarQube, 6 in ErrorProne, 4 in Infer, and 8 in PMD). In addition, 53 out of the 64 bugs cannot be detected by the SOTA baseline. We have reported all the bugs to developers, with two of them already fixed. Three more have been confirmed by developers, while the rest are awaiting response. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and underscore the promise of agentic, LLM-driven data synthesis to advance software engineering.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning is a machine learning methodology that has demonstrated strong performance across a variety of tasks. In particular, it plays a central role in the development of artificial autonomous agents. As these agents become increasingly capable, market readiness is rapidly approaching, which means those agents, for example taking the form of humanoid robots or autonomous cars, are poised to transition from laboratory prototypes to autonomous operation in real-world environments. This transition raises concerns leading to specific requirements for these systems - among them, the requirement that they are designed to behave ethically. Crucially, research directed toward building agents that fulfill the requirement to behave ethically - referred to as artificial moral agents(AMAs) - has to address a range of challenges at the intersection of computer science and philosophy. This study explores the development of reason-based artificial moral agents (RBAMAs). RBAMAs are build on an extension of the reinforcement learning architecture to enable moral decision-making based on sound normative reasoning, which is achieved by equipping the agent with the capacity to learn a reason-theory - a theory which enables it to process morally relevant propositions to derive moral obligations - through case-based feedback. They are designed such that they adapt their behavior to ensure conformance to these obligations while they pursue their designated tasks. These features contribute to the moral justifiability of the their actions, their moral robustness, and their moral trustworthiness, which proposes the extended architecture as a concrete and deployable framework for the development of AMAs that fulfills key ethical desiderata. This study presents a first implementation of an RBAMA and demonstrates the potential of RBAMAs in initial experiments.

Abstract: The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in household environments, especially in the form of proactive autonomous agents, brings about possibilities of comfort and attention as well as it comes with intra or extramural ethical challenges. This article analyzes agentic AI and its applications, focusing on its move from reactive to proactive autonomy, privacy, fairness and user control. We review responsible innovation frameworks, human-centered design principles, and governance practices to distill practical guidance for ethical smart home systems. Vulnerable user groups such as elderly individuals, children, and neurodivergent who face higher risks of surveillance, bias, and privacy risks were studied in detail in context of Agentic AI. Design imperatives are highlighted such as tailored explainability, granular consent mechanisms, and robust override controls, supported by participatory and inclusive methodologies. It was also explored how data-driven insights, including social media analysis via Natural Language Processing(NLP), can inform specific user needs and ethical concerns. This survey aims to provide both a conceptual foundation and suggestions for developing transparent, inclusive, and trustworthy agentic AI in household automation.

<title>Towards Mitigation of Hallucination for LLM-empowered Agents: Progressive Generalization Bound Exploration and Watchdog Monitor</title>

Abstract: Empowered by large language models (LLMs), intelligent agents have become a popular paradigm for interacting with open environments to facilitate AI deployment. However, hallucinations generated by LLMs-where outputs are inconsistent with facts-pose a significant challenge, undermining the credibility of intelligent agents. Only if hallucinations can be mitigated, the intelligent agents can be used in real-world without any catastrophic risk. Therefore, effective detection and mitigation of hallucinations are crucial to ensure the dependability of agents. Unfortunately, the related approaches either depend on white-box access to LLMs or fail to accurately identify hallucinations. To address the challenge posed by hallucinations of intelligent agents, we present HalMit, a novel black-box watchdog framework that models the generalization bound of LLM-empowered agents and thus detect hallucinations without requiring internal knowledge of the LLM's architecture. Specifically, a probabilistic fractal sampling technique is proposed to generate a sufficient number of queries to trigger the incredible responses in parallel, efficiently identifying the generalization bound of the target agent. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that HalMit significantly outperforms existing approaches in hallucination monitoring. Its black-box nature and superior performance make HalMit a promising solution for enhancing the dependability of LLM-powered systems.

<title>HyDRA: A Hybrid-Driven Reasoning Architecture for Verifiable Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: The synergy between symbolic knowledge, often represented by Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and the generative capabilities of neural networks is central to advancing neurosymbolic AI. A primary bottleneck in realizing this potential is the difficulty of automating KG construction, which faces challenges related to output reliability, consistency, and verifiability. These issues can manifest as structural inconsistencies within the generated graphs, such as the formation of disconnected $\textit{isolated islands}$ of data or the inaccurate conflation of abstract classes with specific instances. To address these challenges, we propose HyDRA, a $\textbf{Hy}$brid-$\textbf{D}$riven $\textbf{R}$easoning $\textbf{A}$rchitecture designed for verifiable KG automation. Given a domain or an initial set of documents, HyDRA first constructs an ontology via a panel of collaborative neurosymbolic agents. These agents collaboratively agree on a set of competency questions (CQs) that define the scope and requirements the ontology must be able to answer. Given these CQs, we build an ontology graph that subsequently guides the automated extraction of triplets for KG generation from arbitrary documents. Inspired by design-by-contracts (DbC) principles, our method leverages verifiable contracts as the primary control mechanism to steer the generative process of Large Language Models (LLMs). To verify the output of our approach, we extend beyond standard benchmarks and propose an evaluation framework that assesses the functional correctness of the resulting KG by leveraging symbolic verifications as described by the neurosymbolic AI framework, $\textit{SymbolicAI}$. This work contributes a hybrid-driven architecture for improving the reliability of automated KG construction and the exploration of evaluation methods for measuring the functional integrity of its output. The code is publicly available.

<title>A Pilot Study on LLM-Based Agentic Translation from Android to iOS: Pitfalls and Insights</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of mobile applications has led to a significant demand for cross-platform compatibility, particularly between the Android and iOS platforms. Traditional approaches to mobile application translation often rely on manual intervention or rule-based systems, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. While recent advancements in machine learning have introduced automated methods, they often lack contextual understanding and adaptability, resulting in suboptimal translations. Large Language Models (LLMs) were recently leveraged to enhance code translation at different granularities, including the method, class, and repository levels. Researchers have investigated common errors, limitations, and potential strategies to improve these tasks. However, LLM-based application translation across different platforms, such as migrating mobile applications between Android and iOS or adapting software across diverse frameworks, remains underexplored. Understanding the performance, strengths, and limitations of LLMs in cross-platform application translation is critical for advancing software engineering automation. This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating LLM-based agentic approaches for mobile application translation, identifying key failure points, and proposing guidelines to improve translation performance. We developed a chain of agents that account for dependencies, specifications, program structure, and program control flow when translating applications from Android to iOS. To evaluate the performance, we manually examined the translated code for syntactic correctness, semantic accuracy, and functional completeness. For translation failures, we further conducted a detailed root cause analysis to understand the underlying limitations of the agentic translation process and identify opportunities for improvement.

<title>Making REST APIs Agent-Ready: From OpenAPI to Model Context Protocol Servers for Tool-Augmented LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16044</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16044</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.16044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from passive text generators into active agents that invoke external tools. To support this shift, scalable protocols for tool integration are essential. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a schema-driven standard for dynamic tool discovery and invocation. Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and repetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and configure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims to eliminate.
  This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully automated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged GitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include servers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive scaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates MCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API definitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema registration and authentication handling.
  We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across over 10 domains. From a stratified sample of 1,023 tool calls, 76.5% succeeded out of the box. Manual failure analysis revealed five recurring issues, all attributable to inconsistencies or omissions in the OpenAPI contracts. After minor fixes, averaging 19 lines of spec changes per API, AutoMCP achieved 99.9% success.
  Our findings (i) analyze MCP adoption and quantify the cost of manual server development, (ii) demonstrate that OpenAPI specifications, despite quality issues, enable near-complete MCP server automation, and (iii) contribute a corpus of 5,066 callable tools along with insights on repairing common specification flaws.

Abstract: Deep research agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are rapidly advancing; yet, their performance often plateaus when generating complex, long-form research reports using generic test-time scaling algorithms. Drawing inspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles of searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report generation as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a preliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation to guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through a "denoising" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism that incorporates external information at each step. The core process is further enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of the agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the diffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process more timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative search process. We demonstrate that our TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) techniques to tackle complex problems, representing a transformative breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI). However, their reasoning capabilities have primarily been demonstrated in solving math and coding problems, leaving their potential for domain-specific applications-such as battery discovery-largely unexplored. Inspired by the idea that reasoning mirrors a form of guided search, we introduce ChatBattery, a novel agentic framework that integrates domain knowledge to steer LLMs toward more effective reasoning in materials design. Using ChatBattery, we successfully identify, synthesize, and characterize three novel lithium-ion battery cathode materials, which achieve practical capacity improvements of 28.8%, 25.2%, and 18.5%, respectively, over the widely used cathode material, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811). Beyond this discovery, ChatBattery paves a new path by showing a successful LLM-driven and reasoning-based platform for battery materials invention. This complete AI-driven cycle-from design to synthesis to characterization-demonstrates the transformative potential of AI-driven reasoning in revolutionizing materials discovery.

Abstract: Social robots are embodied agents that interact with people while following human communication norms. These robots interact using verbal and non-verbal cues, and share the physical environments of people. While social robots have previously utilized rule-based systems or probabilistic models for user interaction, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to develop LLM-empowered social robots for enhanced human-robot interaction. To fully realize these capabilities, however, robots need to collect data such as audio, fine-grained images, video, and locations. As a result, LLMs often process sensitive personal information, particularly within home environments. Given the tension between utility and privacy risks, evaluating how current LLMs manage sensitive data is critical. Specifically, we aim to explore the extent to which out-of-the-box LLMs are privacy-aware in the context of household social robots. In this study, we present a set of privacy-relevant scenarios crafted through the lens of Contextual Integrity (CI). We first survey users' privacy preferences regarding in-home social robot behaviors and then examine how their privacy orientation affects their choices of these behaviors (N = 450). We then provide the same set of scenarios and questions to state-of-the-art LLMs (N = 10) and find that the agreement between humans and LLMs is low. To further investigate the capabilities of LLMs as a potential privacy controller, we implement four additional prompting strategies and compare their results. Finally, we discuss the implications and potential of AI privacy awareness in human-robot interaction.

<title>Emergent Cognitive Convergence via Implementation: A Structured Loop Reflecting Four Theories of Mind (A Position Paper)</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16184</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.16184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a structural convergence across four influential theories of mind: Kahneman's dual-system theory, Friston's predictive processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind-emerging unintentionally within a practical AI agent architecture called Agentic Flow. Designed to address limitations in large language models (LLMs), Agentic Flow comprises five interdependent modules such as Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Memory, and Action arranged in a recurrent cognitive loop. Although originally inspired only by Minsky and Clark, the system's structure retrospectively aligns with computational motifs found in all four theories, including predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control.
  To assess this convergence, we conducted comparative experiments with baseline LLM agents on multi-step reasoning tasks. The structured agent achieved 95.8% task success and exhibited strong constraint adherence, while the baseline system succeeded 62.3% of the time. These results were not aimed at proving superiority, but at illustrating how theoretical structures may emerge through practical design choices rather than top-down theory.
  We introduce PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture that captures design-level regularities observed in Agentic Flow. Not intended as a new theory, PEACE provides a shared vocabulary for understanding architectures shaped by real-world implementation demands. This paper should be read as a position paper - an exploratory reflection on how implementation can surface latent structural echoes of cognitive theory, without asserting theoretical unification.

<title>Do Large Language Models Have a Planning Theory of Mind? Evidence from MindGames: a Multi-Step Persuasion Task</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16196</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.16196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent evidence suggests Large Language Models (LLMs) display Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities. Most ToM experiments place participants in a spectatorial role, wherein they predict and interpret other agents' behavior. However, human ToM also contributes to dynamically planning action and strategically intervening on others' mental states. We present MindGames: a novel `planning theory of mind' (PToM) task which requires agents to infer an interlocutor's beliefs and desires to persuade them to alter their behavior. Unlike previous evaluations, we explicitly evaluate use cases of ToM. We find that humans significantly outperform o1-preview (an LLM) at our PToM task (11% higher; $p=0.006$). We hypothesize this is because humans have an implicit causal model of other agents (e.g., they know, as our task requires, to ask about people's preferences). In contrast, o1-preview outperforms humans in a baseline condition which requires a similar amount of planning but minimal mental state inferences (e.g., o1-preview is better than humans at planning when already given someone's preferences). These results suggest a significant gap between human-like social reasoning and LLM abilities.

Abstract: The automatic generation of Verilog code using Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered significant interest in hardware design automation. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in Verilog generation fall short in replicating real-world design workflows due to their designs' simplicity, inadequate design specifications, and less rigorous verification environments. To address these limitations, we present RealBench, the first benchmark aiming at real-world IP-level Verilog generation tasks. RealBench features complex, structured, real-world open-source IP designs, multi-modal and formatted design specifications, and rigorous verification environments, including 100% line coverage testbenches and a formal checker. It supports both module-level and system-level tasks, enabling comprehensive assessments of LLM capabilities. Evaluations on various LLMs and agents reveal that even one of the best-performing LLMs, o1-preview, achieves only a 13.3% pass@1 on module-level tasks and 0% on system-level tasks, highlighting the need for stronger Verilog generation models in the future. The benchmark is open-sourced at https://github.com/IPRC-DIP/RealBench.

Abstract: A space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture is proposed, empowered by multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS) capable of simultaneously reflecting, amplifying, and harvesting wireless energy. The MF-RIS plays a pivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in shadowed regions, while explicitly accounting for both communication and computing energy consumption across the SAGIN nodes. To maximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE), we formulate a joint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element selection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude platform station (HAPS) deployment, user association, and computing capability. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and non-linear and contains mixed discrete-continuous parameters. To tackle this, we conceive a compressed hybrid intelligence for twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CHIMERA) framework, which integrates semantic state-action compression and parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to efficiently explore suitable complex actions. The simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed CHIMERA scheme substantially outperforms the conventional benchmarks, including fixed-configuration or non-harvesting MF-RIS, traditional RIS, and no-RIS cases, as well as centralized and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning baselines in terms of the highest EE. Moreover, the proposed SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture achieves superior EE performance due to its complementary coverage, offering notable advantages over either standalone satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.

<title>Best-of-Both-Worlds Guarantees with Fairer Endings</title>

Abstract: Fair allocation of indivisible goods is a fundamental problem at the interface of economics and computer science. Traditional approaches focus either on randomized allocations that are fair in expectation or deterministic allocations that are approximately fair. Recent work reconciles both these approaches via best-of-both-worlds guarantees, wherein one seeks randomized allocations that are fair in expectation (ex-ante fair) while being supported on approximately fair allocations (ex-post fair). Prior work has shown that under additive valuations, there always exists a randomized allocation that is ex-ante stochastic-dominance envy-free (sd-EF) and ex-post envy-free up to one good (EF1).
  Our work is motivated by the goal of achieving stronger ex-post fairness guarantees such as envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) along with meaningful ex-ante guarantees. We make the following contributions:
  1) We first consider lexicographic preferences, a subdomain of additive valuations where ex-post EFX allocations always exist and can be computed efficiently. On the negative side, we show that ex-ante sd-EF is fundamentally incompatible with ex-post EFX, prompting a relaxation of the ex-ante benchmark. We then present a poly. time algorithm that achieves ex-post EFX and PO together with ex-ante 9/10-EF. Our algorithm uses dependent rounding and leverages structural properties of EFX and PO allocations.
  2)For monotone valuations, we study EFX-with-charity: a relaxation of EFX where some goods remain unallocated, with no agent envying the unallocated pool. We show that ex-post EFX-with-charity can be achieved alongside ex-ante 0.5-EF.
  3)Finally, for subadditive valuations, we strengthen our previous ex-post guarantee to EFX-with-bounded-charity, where at most n-1 goods (n= no. of agents) remain unallocated, at the price of weakening the ex-ante guarantee to 0.5-proportionality.

Abstract: The integration of voice-based AI agents in healthcare presents a transformative opportunity to bridge economic and accessibility gaps in digital health delivery. This paper explores the role of large language model (LLM)-powered voice assistants in enhancing preventive care and continuous patient monitoring, particularly in underserved populations. Drawing insights from the development and pilot study of Agent PULSE (Patient Understanding and Liaison Support Engine) -- a collaborative initiative between IBM Research, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and Morehouse School of Medicine -- we present an economic model demonstrating how AI agents can provide cost-effective healthcare services where human intervention is economically unfeasible. Our pilot study with 33 inflammatory bowel disease patients revealed that 70\% expressed acceptance of AI-driven monitoring, with 37\% preferring it over traditional modalities. Technical challenges, including real-time conversational AI processing, integration with healthcare systems, and privacy compliance, are analyzed alongside policy considerations surrounding regulation, bias mitigation, and patient autonomy. Our findings suggest that AI-driven voice agents not only enhance healthcare scalability and efficiency but also improve patient engagement and accessibility. For healthcare executives, our cost-utility analysis demonstrates huge potential savings for routine monitoring tasks, while technologists can leverage our framework to prioritize improvements yielding the highest patient impact. By addressing current limitations and aligning AI development with ethical and regulatory frameworks, voice-based AI agents can serve as a critical entry point for equitable, sustainable digital healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Recently, AI agents are rapidly evolving in intelligence and widely used in professional research applications, such as STEM, software development, finance, etc. Among these AI agents, deep research agent is a key category as it can perform long-horizon tasks and solve problems of greater complexity. However, there are few evaluation frameworks and benchmarks that systematically and automatically investigate the capabilities of these research agents. Furthermore, financial research problems have distinct complexity and subtlety. To fill in the gap, we propose FinResearchBench, which is a logic tree based Agent-as-a-Judge and targets specifically for the financial research agents. It provides a comprehensive and automatic assessment of the research agents across 7 key types of tasks in the financial research domain. The contributions of this work are two-folded: (1) the first and innovative Agent-as-a-Judge system that extracts the logic tree of the research outcome and uses it as the intermediate information to present a comprehensive, reliable and robust evaluation; (2) finance oriented that it covers 70 typical financial research questions, spreading across 7 frequently encountered types of tasks in the domain.

Abstract: Mapping deep neural networks (DNNs) to hardware is critical for optimizing latency, energy consumption, and resource utilization, making it a cornerstone of high-performance accelerator design. Due to the vast and complex mapping space, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach-but its effectiveness is often limited by sample inefficiency. We present a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to overcome this challenge. By distributing the search across multiple agents, our framework accelerates exploration. To avoid inefficiencies from training multiple agents in parallel, we introduce an agent clustering algorithm that assigns similar mapping parameters to the same agents based on correlation analysis. This enables a decentralized, parallelized learning process that significantly improves sample efficiency. Experimental results show our MARL approach improves sample efficiency by 30-300x over standard single-agent RL, achieving up to 32.61x latency reduction and 16.45x energy-delay product (EDP) reduction under iso-sample conditions.

Abstract: The emergence of deep research systems presents significant capabilities in problem-solving, extending from basic queries to sophisticated research tasks. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate these systems as agents for web retrieval and report generation, overlooking their potential to discover novel insights on the frontiers of scientific research. To address this gap, we introduce ResearcherBench, the first benchmark focused on evaluating the capabilities of these advanced, agentic systems - which we refer to as Deep AI Research Systems (DARS) - on frontier AI scientific questions. We compiled a dataset of 65 research questions expertly selected from real-world scientific scenarios such as laboratory discussions and interviews, spanning 35 different AI subjects and categorized into three types: technical details, literature review, and open consulting. Our dual evaluation framework combines rubric assessment, which uses expert-designed criteria to evaluate insight quality, with factual assessment, which measures citation accuracy (faithfulness) and coverage (groundedness). We evaluated several leading commercial DARS and baseline systems.

Abstract: Persistent monitoring of dynamic targets is essential in real-world applications such as disaster response, environmental sensing, and wildlife conservation, where mobile agents must continuously gather information under uncertainty. We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at accomplishing complex objectives through the collaborative efforts of individual agents. Among the methodologies employed in MAS, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) stands out as one of the most efficacious algorithms. However, when confronted with the complex objective of Formation Control with Collision Avoidance (FCCA): designing an effective reward function that facilitates swift convergence of the policy network to an optimal solution. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that aims to overcome this challenge. By giving large language models (LLMs) on the prioritization of tasks and the observable information available to each agent, our framework generates reward functions that can be dynamically adjusted online based on evaluation outcomes by employing more advanced evaluation metrics rather than the rewards themselves. This mechanism enables the MAS to simultaneously achieve formation control and obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments with enhanced efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to reach superior performance levels. Our empirical studies, conducted in both simulation and real-world settings, validate the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed approach.

<title>LLM-Driven Collaborative Model for Untangling Commits via Explicit and Implicit Dependency Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Atomic commits, each of which addresses a single development concern, are a best practice in software development. However, developers frequently produce tangled commits that mix unrelated changes due to practical constraints or unclear boundaries, negatively impacting code review and maintenance. Although prior commit untangling approaches: rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based, have made progress, they often rely on shallow signals and fail to distinguish between explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) and implicit ones (e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes. ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies, another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives through iterative consultation. To capture explicit and implicit contextual information, we construct multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG), enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C# and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on the C# dataset and 100% on the Java dataset. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit untangling tasks.

<title>From model-based learning to model-free behaviour with Meta-Interpretive Learning</title>

Abstract: A "model" is a theory that describes the state of an environment and the effects of an agent's decisions on the environment. A model-based agent can use its model to predict the effects of its future actions and so plan ahead, but must know the state of the environment. A model-free agent cannot plan, but can act without a model and without completely observing the environment. An autonomous agent capable of acting independently in novel environments must combine both sets of capabilities. We show how to create such an agent with Meta-Interpretive Learning used to learn a model-based Solver used to train a model-free Controller that can solve the same planning problems as the Solver. We demonstrate the equivalence in problem-solving ability of the two agents on grid navigation problems in two kinds of environment: randomly generated mazes, and lake maps with wide open areas. We find that all navigation problems solved by the Solver are also solved by the Controller, indicating the two are equivalent.

Abstract: Semantic communication systems introduce a new paradigm in wireless communications, focusing on transmitting the intended meaning rather than ensuring strict bit-level accuracy. These systems often rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn and encode meaning directly from data, enabling more efficient communication. However, in multi-user settings where interacting agents are trained independently-without shared context or joint optimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead to semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of traditional transmission errors. In this work, we address semantic mismatch in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by proposing a joint physical and semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is implemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at the transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a post-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two solutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear DNN-based semantic equalizer. Both methods are designed to operate under semantic compression in the latent space and adhere to transmit power constraints. Through extensive evaluations, we show that the proposed joint equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range of scenarios and wireless channel conditions.

<title>Distributed Oscillatory Guidance for Formation Flight of Fixed-Wing Drones</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The autonomous formation flight of fixed-wing drones is hard when the coordination requires the actuation over their speeds since they are critically bounded and aircraft are mostly designed to fly at a nominal airspeed. This paper proposes an algorithm to achieve formation flights of fixed-wing drones without requiring any actuation over their speed. In particular, we guide all the drones to travel over specific paths, e.g., parallel straight lines, and we superpose an oscillatory behavior onto the guiding vector field that drives the drones to the paths. This oscillation enables control over the average velocity along the path, thereby facilitating inter-drone coordination. Each drone adjusts its oscillation amplitude distributively in a closed-loop manner by communicating with neighboring agents in an undirected and connected graph. A novel consensus algorithm is introduced, leveraging a non-negative, asymmetric saturation function. This unconventional saturation is justified since negative amplitudes do not make drones travel backward or have a negative velocity along the path. Rigorous theoretical analysis of the algorithm is complemented by validation through numerical simulations and a real-world formation flight.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents hold promise for a flexible and scalable alternative to traditional business process automation, but struggle to reliably follow complex company policies. In this study we introduce a deterministic, transparent, and modular framework for enforcing business policy adherence in agentic workflows. Our method operates in two phases: (1) an offline buildtime stage that compiles policy documents into verifiable guard code associated with tool use, and (2) a runtime integration where these guards ensure compliance before each agent action. We demonstrate our approach on the challenging $\tau$-bench Airlines domain, showing encouraging preliminary results in policy enforcement, and further outline key challenges for real-world deployments.

<title>Arbitrage Tactics in the Local Markets via Hierarchical Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Strategic bidding tactics employed by prosumers in local markets, including the Local Electricity Market (LEM) and Local Flexibility Market (LFM), have attracted significant attention due to their potential to enhance economic benefits for market participants through optimized energy management and bidding. While existing research has explored strategic bidding in a single market with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, arbitrage opportunities across local markets remain unexplored. This paper introduces a hierarchical MARL (HMARL) algorithm designed to enable aggregator arbitrage across multiple local markets. The strategic behavior of these aggregators in local markets is modeled as a two-stage Markov game: the first stage involves the LEM, while the second stage encompasses both the LFM and the balancing market. To solve this two-stage Markov game, the HMARL framework assigns two sub-agents to each aggregator, a primary sub-agent and a secondary sub-agent. Without the arbitrage strategy, these sub-agents operate in silos, with the primary sub-agent focusing on first-stage profits and the secondary sub-agent on second-stage profits, each employing independent MARLs. On the contrary, when implementing the arbitrage strategy with the proposed HMARL, the sub-agents communicate and coordinate to perform arbitrage across multiple local markets, enhancing overall efficiency. The case study, conducted under a scenario where all aggregators employ the arbitrage strategy, shows that despite higher initial costs in the LEM, this strategy generates substantial savings in the LFM and the balancing market, resulting in a total profit increase of $40.6\%$ on average. This highlights the capability of the proposed HMARL to address the two-stage Markov game and facilitate arbitrage across local markets, thereby enhancing profitability for participants.

Abstract: Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) but often fall short on complex queries, delivering limited, extractive answers and struggling with multiple targeted retrievals or navigating intricate entity relationships. This is a critical gap in knowledge-intensive domains. We introduce INRAExplorer, an agentic RAG system for exploring the scientific data of INRAE (France's National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment). INRAExplorer employs an LLM-based agent with a multi-tool architecture to dynamically engage a rich knowledge base, through a comprehensive knowledge graph derived from open access INRAE publications. This design empowers INRAExplorer to conduct iterative, targeted queries, retrieve exhaustive datasets (e.g., all publications by an author), perform multi-hop reasoning, and deliver structured, comprehensive answers. INRAExplorer serves as a concrete illustration of enhancing knowledge interaction in specialized fields.

Abstract: Humans flexibly construct internal models to navigate novel situations. To be useful, these internal models must be sufficiently faithful to the environment that resource-limited planning leads to adequate outcomes; equally, they must be tractable to construct in the first place. We argue that analogy plays a central role in these processes, enabling agents to reuse solution-relevant structure from past experiences and amortise the computational costs of both model construction (construal) and planning. Formalising analogies as partial homomorphisms between Markov decision processes, we sketch a framework in which abstract modules, derived from previous construals, serve as composable building blocks for new ones. This modular reuse allows for flexible adaptation of policies and representations across domains with shared structural essence.

<title>A Distributed Actor-Critic Algorithm for Fixed-Time Consensus in Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.16520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based backstepping control strategy to achieve fixed time consensus in nonlinear multi-agent systems with strict feedback dynamics. Agents exchange only output information with their neighbors over a directed communication graph, without requiring full state measurements or symmetric communication. Achieving fixed time consensus, where convergence occurs within a pre-specified time bound that is independent of initial conditions is faced with significant challenges due to the presence of unknown nonlinearities, inter-agent couplings, and external disturbances. This work addresses these challenges by integrating actor critic reinforcement learning with a novel fixed time adaptation mechanism. Each agent employs an actor critic architecture supported by two estimator networks designed to handle system uncertainties and unknown perturbations. The adaptation laws are developed to ensure that all agents track the leader within a fixed time regardless of their initial conditions. The consensus and tracking errors are guaranteed to converge to a small neighborhood of the origin, with the convergence radius adjustable through control parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlight its advantages over state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence speed and robustness.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the findings of a user study that evaluated the social acceptance of eXtended Reality (XR) agent technology, focusing on a remotely accessible, web-based XR training system developed for journalists. This system involves user interaction with a virtual avatar, enabled by a modular toolkit. The interactions are designed to provide tailored training for journalists in digital-remote settings, especially for sensitive or dangerous scenarios, without requiring specialized end-user equipment like headsets. Our research adapts and extends the Almere model, representing social acceptance through existing attributes such as perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, along with added ones like dependability and security in the user-agent interaction. The XR agent was tested through a controlled experiment in a real-world setting, with data collected on users' perceptions. Our findings, based on quantitative and qualitative measurements involving questionnaires, contribute to the understanding of user perceptions and acceptance of XR agent solutions within a specific social context, while also identifying areas for the improvement of XR systems.

Abstract: Dynamic game theory offers a toolbox for formalizing and solving for both cooperative and non-cooperative strategies in multi-agent scenarios. However, the optimal configuration of such games remains largely unexplored. While there is existing literature on the parametrization of dynamic games, little research examines this parametrization from a strategic perspective where each agent's configuration choice is influenced by the decisions of others. In this work, we introduce the concept of a game of configuration, providing a framework for the strategic fine-tuning of differential games. We define a game of configuration as a two-stage game within the setting of finite-horizon, affine-quadratic, AQ, differential games. In the first stage, each player chooses their corresponding configuration parameter, which will impact their dynamics and costs in the second stage. We provide the subgame perfect solution concept and a method for computing first stage cost gradients over the configuration space. This then allows us to formulate a gradient-based method for searching for local solutions to the configuration game, as well as provide necessary conditions for equilibrium configurations over their downstream (second stage) trajectories. We conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in example AQ systems, both zero-sum and general-sum.

Abstract: Accurate and contrast-free Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) prediction from Cine MRI sequences remains a critical challenge. Existing methods typically necessitate supervised learning based on human-refined masks in the ventricular myocardium, which become impractical without contrast agents. We introduce a self-supervised framework, namely Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial Learning (CTSL), that learns dynamic, spatiotemporal representations from raw Cine data without requiring segmentation masks. CTSL decouples temporal and spatial features through a multi-view distillation strategy, where the teacher model processes multiple Cine views, and the student model learns from reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. By leveraging codebook-based feature representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, CTSL captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns. High-confidence MACE risk predictions are achieved through our model, providing a rapid, non-invasive solution for cardiac risk assessment that outperforms traditional contrast-dependent methods, thereby enabling timely and accessible heart disease diagnosis in clinical settings.

Abstract: This work presents a novel computer architecture that extends the Von Neumann model with a dedicated Reasoning Unit (RU) to enable native artificial general intelligence capabilities. The RU functions as a specialized co-processor that executes symbolic inference, multi-agent coordination, and hybrid symbolic-neural computation as fundamental architectural primitives. This hardware-embedded approach allows autonomous agents to perform goal-directed planning, dynamic knowledge manipulation, and introspective reasoning directly within the computational substrate at system scale. The architecture incorporates a reasoning-specific instruction set architecture, parallel symbolic processing pipelines, agent-aware kernel abstractions, and a unified memory hierarchy that seamlessly integrates cognitive and numerical workloads. Through systematic co-design across hardware, operating system, and agent runtime layers, this architecture establishes a computational foundation where reasoning, learning, and adaptation emerge as intrinsic execution properties rather than software abstractions, potentially enabling the development of general-purpose intelligent machines.

Abstract: Efficient planning of activities is essential for modern industrial assembly lines to uphold manufacturing standards, prevent project constraint violations, and achieve cost-effective operations. While exact solutions to such challenges can be obtained through Integer Programming (IP), the dependence of the search space on input parameters often makes IP computationally infeasible for large-scale scenarios. Heuristic methods, such as Genetic Algorithms, can also be applied, but they frequently produce suboptimal solutions in extensive cases. This paper introduces a novel mathematical model of a generic industrial assembly line formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), without imposing assumptions on the type of assembly line a notable distinction from most existing models. The proposed model is employed to create a virtual environment for training Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents to optimize task and resource scheduling. To enhance the efficiency of agent training, the paper proposes two innovative tools. The first is an action-masking technique, which ensures the agent selects only feasible actions, thereby reducing training time. The second is a multi-agent approach, where each workstation is managed by an individual agent, as a result, the state and action spaces were reduced. A centralized training framework with decentralized execution is adopted, offering a scalable learning architecture for optimizing industrial assembly lines. This framework allows the agents to learn offline and subsequently provide real-time solutions during operations by leveraging a neural network that maps the current factory state to the optimal action. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating significantly faster convergence to the optimal solution compared to a comparable model-based approach.

Abstract: Modern smart grids demand fast, intelligent, and energy-aware computing at the edge to manage real time fluctuations and ensure reliable operation. This paper introduces FOGNITE Fog-based Grid In intelligence with Neural Integration and Twin based Execution a next-generation fog cloud framework designed to enhance autonomy, resilience, and efficiency in distributed energy systems. FOGNITE combines three core components: federated learning, reinforcement learning, and digital twin validation. Each fog node trains a local CNN LSTM model on private energy consumption data, enabling predictive intelligence while preserving data privacy through federated aggregation. A reinforcement learning agent dynamically schedules tasks based on current system load and energy conditions, optimizing for performance under uncertainty.
  To prevent unsafe or inefficient decisions, a hierarchical digital twin layer simulates potential actions before deployment, significantly reducing execution errors and energy waste. We evaluate FOGNITE on a real world testbed of Raspberry Pi devices, showing up to a 93.7% improvement in load balancing accuracy and a 63.2% reduction in energy waste compared to conventional architectures. By shifting smart grid control from reactive correction to proactive optimization, FOGNITE represents a step toward more intelligent, adaptive, and sustainable energy infrastructures

Abstract: Desktop accessibility metadata enables AI agents to interpret screens and supports users who depend on tools like screen readers. Yet, many applications remain largely inaccessible due to incomplete or missing metadata provided by developers - our investigation shows that only 33% of applications on macOS offer full accessibility support. While recent work on structured screen representation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element detection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of desktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To bridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically create real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single screenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to detect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's system-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of data for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three datasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element detection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside corresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees, achieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree. Crucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to interpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce Screen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous agent task execution in macOS desktop environments. Using this benchmark, we demonstrate that Screen2AX delivers a 2.2x performance improvement over native accessibility representations and surpasses the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2 system on the ScreenSpot benchmark.

Abstract: Agentic search, as a more autonomous and adaptive paradigm of retrieval augmentation, is driving the evolution of intelligent search systems. However, existing evaluation frameworks fail to align well with the goals of agentic search. First, the complex queries commonly used in current benchmarks often deviate from realistic user search scenarios. Second, prior approaches tend to introduce noise when extracting ground truth for end-to-end evaluations, leading to distorted assessments at a fine-grained level. Third, most current frameworks focus solely on the quality of final answers, neglecting the evaluation of the iterative process inherent to agentic search. To address these limitations, we propose RAVine -- a Reality-Aligned eValuation framework for agentic LLMs with search. RAVine targets multi-point queries and long-form answers that better reflect user intents, and introduces an attributable ground truth construction strategy to enhance the accuracy of fine-grained evaluation. Moreover, RAVine examines model's interaction with search tools throughout the iterative process, and accounts for factors of efficiency. We benchmark a series of models using RAVine and derive several insights, which we hope will contribute to advancing the development of agentic search systems. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SwordFaith/RAVine.

Abstract: Asthma-related deaths in the UK are the highest in Europe, and only 30% of patients access basic care. There is a need for alternative approaches to reaching people with asthma in order to provide health education, self-management support and bridges to care. Automated conversational agents (specifically, mobile chatbots) present opportunities for providing alternative and individually tailored access to health education, self-management support and risk self-assessment. But would patients engage with a chatbot, and what factors influence engagement? We present results from a patient survey (N=1257) devised by a team of asthma clinicians, patients, and technology developers, conducted to identify optimal factors for efficacy, value and engagement for a chatbot. Results indicate that most adults with asthma (53%) are interested in using a chatbot and the patients most likely to do so are those who believe their asthma is more serious and who are less confident about self-management. Results also indicate enthusiasm for 24/7 access, personalisation, and for WhatsApp as the preferred access method (compared to app, voice assistant, SMS or website). Obstacles to uptake include security/privacy concerns and skepticism of technological capabilities. We present detailed findings and consolidate these into 7 recommendations for developers for optimising efficacy of chatbot-based health support.

<title>Uncertainty-Aware Knowledge Transformers for Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading that integrates uncertainty-aware prediction with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), addressing a critical gap in current literature. In contrast to previous works relying on deterministic forecasts, the proposed approach employs a heteroscedastic probabilistic transformer-based prediction model called Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) to explicitly quantify prediction uncertainty, which is essential for robust decision-making in the stochastic environment of P2P energy trading. The KTU model leverages domain-specific features and is trained with a custom loss function that ensures reliable probabilistic forecasts and confidence intervals for each prediction. Integrating these uncertainty-aware forecasts into the MARL framework enables agents to optimize trading strategies with a clear understanding of risk and variability. Experimental results show that the uncertainty-aware Deep Q-Network (DQN) reduces energy purchase costs by up to 5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading, while increasing electricity sales revenue by 6.4% and 44.7%, respectively. Additionally, peak hour grid demand is reduced by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P. These improvements are even more pronounced when P2P trading is enabled, highlighting the synergy between advanced forecasting and market mechanisms for resilient, economically efficient energy communities.

<title>Test-Time-Matching: Decouple Personality, Memory, and Linguistic Style in LLM-based Role-Playing Language Agent</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled role-playing language agents to demonstrate significant potential in various applications. However, relying solely on prompts and contextual inputs often proves insufficient for achieving deep immersion in specific roles, particularly well-known fictional or public figures. On the other hand, fine-tuning-based approaches face limitations due to the challenges associated with data collection and the computational resources required for training, thereby restricting their broader applicability. To address these issues, we propose Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free role-playing framework through test-time scaling and context engineering. TTM uses LLM agents to automatically decouple a character's features into personality, memory, and linguistic style. Our framework involves a structured, three-stage generation pipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing. It achieves high-fidelity role-playing performance, also enables seamless combinations across diverse linguistic styles and even variations in personality and memory. We evaluate our framework through human assessment, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves the outstanding performance in generating expressive and stylistically consistent character dialogues.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate tremendous potential in the financial domain, yet existing models often fall short in scenarios demanding robust reasoning capabilities, stringent trustworthiness requirements, and efficient adaptation to task-specific needs. We introduce the Agentar-Fin-R1 series of financial large language models (8B and 32B parameters), specifically engineered based on the Qwen3 foundation model to enhance reasoning capabilities, reliability, and domain specialization for financial applications. Our optimization approach integrates a high-quality, systematic financial task taxonomy with a comprehensive multi-layered trustworthiness assurance framework. This framework encompasses high-quality trustworthy knowledge engineering, multi-agent trustworthy data synthesis, and rigorous data validation governance. Through label-guided automated difficulty-aware optimization, tow-stage learning processes, and detailed attribution systems, we achieve substantial improvements in training efficiency. Our models undergo comprehensive evaluation on mainstream financial benchmarks including FinEva, FinEval, and FinanceIQ, as well as general reasoning datasets such as MATH-500 and GPQA. To thoroughly assess real-world deployment capabilities, we innovatively propose the Finova evaluation benchmark, which focuses on agent-level financial reasoning and compliance verification. Experimental results demonstrate that Agentar-Fin-R1 not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on financial tasks but also exhibits exceptional general reasoning capabilities, validating its effectiveness as a trustworthy solution for high-stakes financial applications.

Abstract: We propose LingBench++, a linguistically-informed benchmark and reasoning framework designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on complex linguistic tasks inspired by the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL). Unlike prior benchmarks that focus solely on final answer accuracy, LingBench++ provides structured reasoning traces, stepwise evaluation protocols, and rich typological metadata across over 90 low-resource and cross-cultural languages. We further develop a multi-agent architecture integrating grammatical knowledge retrieval, tool-augmented reasoning, and deliberate hypothesis testing. Through systematic comparisons of baseline and our proposed agentic models, we demonstrate that models equipped with external knowledge sources and iterative reasoning outperform single-pass approaches in both accuracy and interpretability. LingBench++ offers a comprehensive foundation for advancing linguistically grounded, culturally informed, and cognitively plausible reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are among the most promising approaches for leveraging near-term quantum hardware, yet their effectiveness strongly depends on the design of the underlying circuit ansatz, which is typically constructed with heuristic methods. In this work, we represent the synthesis of variational quantum circuits as a sequential decision-making problem, where gates are added iteratively in order to optimize an objective function, and we introduce two reinforcement learning-based methods, RLVQC Global and RLVQC Block, tailored to combinatorial optimization problems. RLVQC Block creates ansatzes that generalize the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), by discovering a two-qubits block that is applied to all the interacting qubit pairs. While RLVQC Global further generalizes the ansatz and adds gates unconstrained by the structure of the interacting qubits. Both methods adopt the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and use empirical measurement outcomes as state observations to guide the agent. We evaluate the proposed methods on a broad set of QUBO instances derived from classical graph-based optimization problems. Our results show that both RLVQC methods exhibit strong results with RLVQC Block consistently outperforming QAOA and generally surpassing RLVQC Global. While RLVQC Block produces circuits with depth comparable to QAOA, the Global variant is instead able to find significantly shorter ones. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning methods can be an effective tool to discover new ansatz structures tailored for specific problems and that the most effective circuit design strategy lies between rigid predefined architectures and completely unconstrained ones, offering a favourable trade-off between structure and adaptability.

<title>Minor Embedding for Quantum Annealing with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) is a quantum computing paradigm for solving combinatorial optimization problems formulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. An essential step in QA is minor embedding, which maps the problem graph onto the sparse topology of the quantum processor. This process is computationally expensive and scales poorly with increasing problem size and hardware complexity. Existing heuristics are often developed for specific problem graphs or hardware topologies and are difficult to generalize. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by treating minor embedding as a sequential decision-making problem, where an agent learns to construct minor embeddings by iteratively mapping the problem variables to the hardware qubits. We propose a RL-based approach to minor embedding using a Proximal Policy Optimization agent, testing its ability to embed both fully connected and randomly generated problem graphs on two hardware topologies, Chimera and Zephyr. The results show that our agent consistently produces valid minor embeddings, with reasonably efficient number of qubits, in particular on the more modern Zephyr topology. Our proposed approach is also able to scale to moderate problem sizes and adapts well to different graph structures, highlighting RL's potential as a flexible and general-purpose framework for minor embedding in QA.

<title>Is memory all you need? Data-driven Mori-Zwanzig modeling of Lagrangian particle dynamics in turbulent flows</title>

Abstract: The dynamics of Lagrangian particles in turbulence play a crucial role in mixing, transport, and dispersion processes in complex flows. Their trajectories exhibit highly non-trivial statistical behavior, motivating the development of surrogate models that can reproduce these trajectories without incurring the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations of the full Eulerian field. This task is particularly challenging because reduced-order models typically lack access to the full set of interactions with the underlying turbulent field. Novel data-driven machine learning techniques can be very powerful in capturing and reproducing complex statistics of the reduced-order/surrogate dynamics. In this work, we show how one can learn a surrogate dynamical system that is able to evolve a turbulent Lagrangian trajectory in a way that is point-wise accurate for short-time predictions (with respect to Kolmogorov time) and stable and statistically accurate at long times. This approach is based on the Mori--Zwanzig formalism, which prescribes a mathematical decomposition of the full dynamical system into resolved dynamics that depend on the current state and the past history of a reduced set of observables and the unresolved orthogonal dynamics due to unresolved degrees of freedom of the initial state. We show how by training this reduced order model on a point-wise error metric on short time-prediction, we are able to correctly learn the dynamics of the Lagrangian turbulence, such that also the long-time statistical behavior is stably recovered at test time. This opens up a range of new applications, for example, for the control of active Lagrangian agents in turbulence.

Abstract: Imitation sometimes achieves success in multi-agent situations even though it is very simple. In game theory, success of imitation has been characterized by unbeatability against other agents. Previous studies specified conditions under which imitation is unbeatable in repeated games, and clarified that the existence of unbeatable imitation is strongly related to the existence of payoff-controlling strategies, called zero-determinant strategies. However, the previous studies mainly focused on ``imitation of opponents''. It was pointed out that imitation of other players in the same group and imitation of other players in the same role in other groups generally result in different outcomes. Here, we investigate the existence condition of unbeatable imitation in the latter ``imitation of friends'' situations. We find that it is stronger than the existence condition of unbeatable zero-determinant strategies, whereas both are very limited. Our findings suggest a strong relation between them even in the `imitation of friends'' situations.

Abstract: Quantum sensing harnesses the unique properties of quantum systems to enable precision measurements of physical quantities such as time, magnetic and electric fields, acceleration, and gravitational gradients well beyond the limits of classical sensors. However, identifying suitable sensing probes and measurement schemes can be a classically intractable task, as it requires optimizing over Hilbert spaces of high dimension. In variational quantum sensing, a probe quantum system is generated via a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), exposed to an unknown physical parameter through a quantum channel, and measured to collect classical data. PQCs and measurements are typically optimized using offline strategies based on frequentist learning criteria. This paper introduces an adaptive protocol that uses Bayesian inference to optimize the sensing policy via the maximization of the active information gain. The proposed variational methodology is tailored for non-asymptotic regimes where a single probe can be deployed in each time step, and is extended to support the fusion of estimates from multiple quantum sensing agents.

Abstract: Medical image synthesis plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, addressing the common issue of missing imaging modalities due to factors such as extended scan times, scan corruption, artifacts, patient motion, and intolerance to contrast agents. The paper presents a novel image synthesis network, the Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model (PHMDiff), which employs a multi-scale hierarchical approach for more detailed control over synthesizing high-quality images across different resolutions and layers. Specifically, this model utilizes randomly multi-scale high-proportion masks to speed up diffusion model training, and balances detail fidelity and overall structure. The integration of a Transformer-based Diffusion model process incorporates cross-granularity regularization, modeling the mutual information consistency across each granularity's latent spaces, thereby enhancing pixel-level perceptual accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that PHMDiff achieves superior performance in both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), highlighting its capability to produce high-quality synthesized images with excellent structural integrity. Ablation studies further confirm the contributions of each component. Furthermore, the PHMDiff model, a multi-scale image synthesis framework across and within medical imaging modalities, shows significant advantages over other methods.

Abstract: Matching games is a novel matching model introduced by Garrido-Lucero and Laraki, in which agents' utilities are endogenously determined as the outcome of a strategic game they play simultaneously with the matching process. Matching games encompass most one-to-one matching market models and reinforce the classical notion of pairwise stability by analyzing their robustness to unilateral deviations within games. In this article, we extend the model to the one-to-many setting, where hospitals can be matched to multiple doctors, and their utility is given by the sum of their game outcomes. We adapt the deferred acceptance with competitions algorithm and the renegotiation process to this new framework and prove that both are polynomial whenever couples play bi-matrix games in mixed strategies.

Abstract: AI scientists powered by large language models have demonstrated substantial promise in autonomously conducting experiments and facilitating scientific discoveries across various disciplines. While their capabilities are promising, these agents also introduce novel vulnerabilities that require careful consideration for safety. However, there has been limited comprehensive exploration of these vulnerabilities. This perspective examines vulnerabilities in AI scientists, shedding light on potential risks associated with their misuse, and emphasizing the need for safety measures. We begin by providing an overview of the potential risks inherent to AI scientists, taking into account user intent, the specific scientific domain, and their potential impact on the external environment. Then, we explore the underlying causes of these vulnerabilities and provide a scoping review of the limited existing works. Based on our analysis, we propose a triadic framework involving human regulation, agent alignment, and an understanding of environmental feedback (agent regulation) to mitigate these identified risks. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations and challenges associated with safeguarding AI scientists and advocate for the development of improved models, robust benchmarks, and comprehensive regulations.

Abstract: Inspired by human-like behaviors for navigation: first searching to explore unknown areas before discovering the target, and then the pathfinding of moving towards the discovered target, recent studies design parallel submodules to achieve different functions in the searching and pathfinding stages, while ignoring the differences in reward signals between the two stages. As a result, these models often cannot be fully trained or are overfitting on training scenes. Another bottleneck that restricts agents from learning two-stage strategies is spatial perception ability, since the studies used generic visual encoders without considering the depth information of navigation scenes. To release the potential of the model on strategy learning, we propose the Two-Stage Reward Mechanism (TSRM) for object navigation that decouples the searching and pathfinding behaviours in an episode, enabling the agent to explore larger area in searching stage and seek the optimal path in pathfinding stage. Also, we propose a pretraining method Depth Enhanced Masked Autoencoders (DE-MAE) that enables agent to determine explored and unexplored areas during the searching stage, locate target object and plan paths during the pathfinding stage more accurately. In addition, we propose a new metric of Searching Success weighted by Searching Path Length (SSSPL) that assesses agent's searching ability and exploring efficiency. Finally, we evaluated our method on AI2-Thor and RoboTHOR extensively and demonstrated it can outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both the success rate and the navigation efficiency.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) appear to be powerful tools to learn state representations for agents in distributed, decentralized multi-agent systems, but generate catastrophically incorrect predictions when nodes update asynchronously during inference. This failure under asynchrony effectively excludes these architectures from many potential applications where synchrony is difficult or impossible to enforce, e.g., robotic swarms or sensor networks. In this work we identify "implicitly-defined" GNNs as a class of architectures which is provably robust to asynchronous "hogwild" inference, adapting convergence guarantees from work in asynchronous and distributed optimization. We then propose a novel implicitly-defined GNN architecture, which we call an 'energy GNN'. We show that this architecture outperforms other GNNs from this class on a variety of synthetic tasks inspired by multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Developing safe, aligned agentic AI systems requires comprehensive empirical testing, yet many existing benchmarks neglect crucial themes aligned with biology and economics, both time-tested fundamental sciences describing our needs and preferences. To address this gap, the present work focuses on introducing biologically and economically motivated themes that have been neglected in current mainstream discussions on AI safety - namely a set of multi-objective, multi-agent alignment benchmarks that emphasize homeostasis for bounded and biological objectives, diminishing returns for unbounded, instrumental, and business objectives, sustainability principle, and resource sharing. We implemented eight main benchmark environments on the above themes, to illustrate key pitfalls and challenges in agentic AI-s, such as unboundedly maximizing a homeostatic objective, over-optimizing one objective at the expense of others, neglecting safety constraints, or depleting shared resources.

Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary vision-language understanding capabilities, their abilities to solve instance-level visual-language problems beyond a single image warrant further exploration. To assess these unproven abilities of MLLMs, this paper proposes a new visual grounding task called multi-context visual grounding, which aims to localize instances of interest across multiple images based on open-ended text prompts. In order to facilitate this research, we construct a new dataset MC-Bench that features 2K high-quality and manually annotated samples. Each sample consists of an instance-level labeled image pair and a corresponding text prompt that indicates the target instances in the images. These text prompts are highly open-ended and follow three distinct styles, covering 20 practical skills. We benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs and foundation models with potential multi-context visual grounding capabilities, along with our developed simple yet effective agentic baseline and a finetuned baseline by multi-context instruction tuning. Our evaluation reveals a non-trivial performance gap between existing MLLMs and humans, along with some insightful observations that suggest potential future directions. We hope that MC-Bench and our empirical findings encourage the research community to further advance the untapped potentials of MLLMs in instance-level tasks, particularly in multi-image contexts.

Abstract: The proliferation of web agents necessitates advanced navigation and interaction strategies within complex web environments. Current models often struggle with efficient navigation and action execution due to limited visibility and understanding of web structures. Our proposed R2D2 framework addresses these challenges by integrating two paradigms: Remember and Reflect. The Remember paradigm uses a replay buffer that aids agents in reconstructing the web environment dynamically, thus enabling the formulation of a detailed "map" of previously visited pages. This helps in reducing navigational errors and optimizing the decision-making process during web interactions. Conversely, the Reflect paradigm allows agents to learn from past mistakes by providing a mechanism for error analysis and strategy refinement, enhancing overall task performance. We evaluate R2D2 using the WebArena benchmark, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods, including a 50% reduction in navigation errors and a threefold increase in task completion rates. Our findings suggest that a combination of memory-enhanced navigation and reflective learning promisingly advances the capabilities of web agents, potentially benefiting various applications such as automated customer service and personal digital assistants.

Abstract: The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zhao-ht/BioMaze.

Abstract: It has been frequently observed that human speakers align their language use with each other during conversations. In this paper, we study empirically whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit the same behavior of conversational adaptation. We construct a corpus of conversations between LLMs and find that two LLM agents end up making more similar syntactic choices as conversations go on, confirming that modern LLMs adapt their language use to their conversational partners in at least a rudimentary way.

Abstract: Given the recent rate of progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, a tantalizing question is emerging: would robots controlled by emerging AI systems be strongly aligned with human values? In this work, we propose a scalable way to probe this question by generating a benchmark spanning the key moments in 824 major pieces of science fiction literature (movies, tv, novels and scientific books) where an agent (AI or robot) made critical decisions (good or bad). We use a state-of-the-art LLM's recollection of each key moment to generate questions in similar situations, the decisions made by the agent, and alternative decisions it could have made (good or bad). We then measure an approximation of how well models align with human values on a set of human-voted answers. We also generate rules that can be automatically improved via an amendment process in order to generate the first Sci-Fi inspired constitutions for promoting ethical behavior in AIs and robots in the real world. Our first finding is that modern LLMs paired with constitutions turn out to be well-aligned with human values (95.8%), contrary to unsettling decisions typically made in Sci-Fi (only 21.2% alignment). Secondly, we find that generated constitutions substantially increase alignment compared to the base model (79.4% to 95.8%), and show resilience to an adversarial prompt setting (23.3% to 92.3%). Additionally, we find that those constitutions are among the top performers on the ASIMOV Benchmark which is derived from real-world images and hospital injury reports. Sci-Fi-inspired constitutions are thus highly aligned and applicable in real-world situations. We release SciFi-Benchmark: a large-scale dataset to advance robot ethics and safety research. It comprises 9,056 questions and 53,384 answers generated through a novel LLM-introspection process, in addition to a smaller human-labeled evaluation set.

<title>Why We Experience Society Differently: Intrinsic Dispositions as Drivers of Ideological Complexity in Adaptive Social Networks</title>

Abstract: Understanding the emergence of inequality in complex systems requires attention to both structural dynamics and intrinsic heterogeneity. In the context of opinion dynamics, traditional models relied on static snapshots or assumed homogeneous agent behavior, overlooking how diverse cognitive dispositions shape belief evolution. While some recent models introduce behavioral heterogeneity, they typically focus on macro-level patterns, neglecting the unequal and individualized dynamics that unfold at the agent level. In this study, we analyze an adaptive social network model where each agent exhibits one of three behavioral tendencies-homophily, neophily (attention to novelty), or social conformity-and measure the complexity of individual opinion trajectories using normalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. We find that the resulting dynamics are often counterintuitive-homophilic agents, despite seeking similarity, become increasingly unpredictable; neophilic agents, despite pursuing novelty, stabilize; and conformic agents follow a U-shaped trajectory, transitioning from early stability to later unpredictability. More fundamentally, these patterns remain robust across diverse network settings, showing that internal behavioral dispositions - not external environment - primarily govern long-term opinion unpredictability. The broader implication is that individuals' experiences of ideological volatility, uncertainty, or stability are not merely environmental, but endogenously self-structured through their own cognitive tendencies. These results establish a novel individual-level lens on opinion dynamics, where the behavioral identity of agents serves as a dynamical fingerprint in the evolution of belief systems, and gives rise to persistent disparities in dynamical experience within self-organizing social systems, even in structurally similar environments.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is accelerating the transformation of scientific research paradigms, not only enhancing research efficiency but also driving innovation. We introduce InternAgent, a unified closed-loop multi-agent framework to conduct Autonomous Scientific Research (ASR) across various scientific research fields, enabling researchers to tackle complicated problems in these fields with unprecedented speed and precision. InternAgent highlights three key advantages: 1) Scalability: InternAgent has demonstrated its versatility across 12 scientific research tasks, capable of generating innovative ideas to enhance the performance of baseline code. 2) Interactivity: InternAgent provides an interface for human expert feedback and multi-agent interaction in automated end-to-end processes, allowing for the seamless integration of domain expert knowledge. 3) Efficiency: InternAgent has achieved promising performance gains in several scientific fields with significantly less time cost compared to human efforts. For instance, in reaction yield prediction, it increased from 27.6% to 35.4% in just 12 hours; in enhancer activity prediction, accuracy rose from 0.65 to 0.79 with only 4 hours of processing; and in 2D semantic segmentation, precision advanced from 78.8% to 81.0% in a mere 30 hours.

<title>The Unified Cognitive Consciousness Theory for Language Models: Anchoring Semantics, Thresholds of Activation, and Emergent Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are vast repositories of latent patterns, but without structured guidance, they lack explicit reasoning, semantic grounding, and goal-directed intelligence. We propose Unified Cognitive Consciousness Theory (UCCT), a unified model that reinterprets LLMs as unconscious substrates requiring external mechanisms, few-shot prompting, RAG, fine-tuning, and multi-agent reasoning, to semantically anchor latent representations. UCCT formalizes this anchoring process through a Bayesian formulation, revealing a threshold-crossing dynamic characterized by 1/sqrt(n) scaling that explains the sudden capability transitions observed across diverse tasks. The theory unifies previously disparate techniques, few-shot prompting, RAG, fine-tuning, and multi-agent reasoning, as special cases of a general anchoring architecture. Through case studies in simple math, visual recognition, and structured debate tasks, we confirm the predictive power of UCCT. Furthermore, our experiment in arithmetic in three numeral systems validates the theories of UCCT. Rather than treating intelligence as an intrinsic property of LLMs, UCCT demonstrates that LLMs are merely unconscious pattern repositories with no inherent intelligence. Intelligence emerges only when external anchoring mechanisms assign target semantics to these latent patterns, transforming unconscious representations into conscious, goal-directed capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based multi-agent systems have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, especially when enhanced through collaborative communication. However, current methods often rely on a fixed number of agents and static communication structures, limiting their ability to adapt to varying task complexities. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Graph Pruning (AGP), a novel task-adaptive multi-agent collaboration framework that jointly optimizes agent quantity (hard-pruning) and communication topology (soft-pruning). Specifically, our method employs a two-stage training strategy: firstly, independently training soft-pruning networks for different agent quantities to determine optimal agent-quantity-specific complete graphs and positional masks across specific tasks; and then jointly optimizing hard-pruning and soft-pruning within a maximum complete graph to dynamically configure the number of agents and their communication topologies per task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is: (1) High-performing, achieving state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks and consistently generalizes across multiple mainstream LLM architectures, with a increase in performance of $2.58\%\sim 9.84\%$; (2) Task-adaptive, dynamically constructing optimized communication topologies tailored to specific tasks, with an extremely high performance in all three task categories (general reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation); (3) Token-economical, having fewer training steps and token consumption at the same time, with a decrease in token consumption of $90\%+$; and (4) Training-efficient, achieving high performance with very few training steps compared with other methods. The performance will surpass the existing baselines after about ten steps of training under six benchmarks.

<title>The Fagnano Triangle Patrolling Problem</title>

Abstract: We investigate a combinatorial optimization problem that involves patrolling the edges of an acute triangle using a unit-speed agent. The goal is to minimize the maximum (1-gap) idle time of any edge, which is defined as the time gap between consecutive visits to that edge. This problem has roots in a centuries-old optimization problem posed by Fagnano in 1775, who sought to determine the inscribed triangle of an acute triangle with the minimum perimeter. It is well-known that the orthic triangle, giving rise to a periodic and cyclic trajectory obeying the laws of geometric optics, is the optimal solution to Fagnano's problem. Such trajectories are known as Fagnano orbits, or more generally as billiard trajectories. We demonstrate that the orthic triangle is also an optimal solution to the patrolling problem.
  Our main contributions pertain to new connections between billiard trajectories and optimal patrolling schedules in combinatorial optimization. In particular, as an artifact of our arguments, we introduce a novel 2-gap patrolling problem that seeks to minimize the visitation time of objects every three visits. We prove that there exist infinitely many well-structured billiard-type optimal trajectories for this problem, including the orthic trajectory, which has the special property of minimizing the visitation time gap between any two consecutively visited edges. Complementary to that, we also examine the cost of dynamic, sub-optimal trajectories to the 1-gap patrolling optimization problem. These trajectories result from a greedy algorithm and can be implemented by a computationally primitive mobile agent.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents increasingly relies on Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) to perform tasks described in natural language with GUI environments, such as websites, desktop computers, or mobile phones. Existing benchmarks for MLM agents in interactive environments are limited by their focus on a single environment, lack of detailed and generalized evaluation methods, and the complexities of constructing tasks and evaluators. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Crab, the first agent benchmark framework designed to support cross-environment tasks, incorporating a graph-based fine-grained evaluation method and an efficient mechanism for task and evaluator construction. Our framework supports multiple devices and can be easily extended to any environment with a Python interface. Leveraging Crab, we developed a cross-platform Crab Benchmark-v0 comprising 120 tasks in computer desktop and mobile phone environments. We evaluated four advanced MLMs using different single and multi-agent system configurations on this benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that the single agent with GPT-4o achieves the best completion ratio of 38.01%. All framework code, agent code, and task datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/camel-ai/crab.

<title>The Free Will Equation: Quantum Field Analogies for AGI</title>

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research traditionally focuses on algorithms that optimize for specific goals under deterministic rules. Yet, human-like intelligence exhibits adaptive spontaneity - an ability to make unexpected choices or free decisions not strictly dictated by past data or immediate reward. This trait, often dubbed "free will" in a loose sense, might be crucial for creativity, robust adaptation, and avoiding ruts in problem-solving. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free Will Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI agents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their decision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive state as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses probabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a quantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement. By incorporating mechanisms analogous to quantum fields, along with intrinsic motivation terms, we aim to improve an agent's ability to explore novel strategies and adapt to unforeseen changes. Experiments in a non-stationary multi-armed bandit environment demonstrate that agents using this framework achieve higher rewards and policy diversity compared to baseline methods.

<title>Open-Source LLMs Collaboration Beats Closed-Source LLMs: A Scalable Multi-Agent System</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14200</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.14200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to demonstrate the potential and strengths of open-source collectives. It leads to a promising question: Can we harness multiple open-source LLMs to match or even beat the closed-source LLMs? To answer this, we propose SMACS, a scalable multi-agent collaboration system (MACS) framework with high performance. Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and generalization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior Selection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select the Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose an Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the generation of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the high-quality response via a hybrid posterior score. Experiments on eight mainstream benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our SMACS: by integrating fifteen open-source LLMs, SMACS outperforms leading closed-source LLMs in 2025, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet (+12.73%), GPT-4.1(+5.36%) and GPT-o3-mini(+5.28%) across multiple tasks. Remarkably, it even exceeds the average of best results of different datasets from both open-source LLMs (+2.86%) and closed-source LLMs (+2.04%), pushing the upper bound of intelligence. Code will be released at https://github.com/magent4aci/SMACS.

Abstract: We present ExCyTIn-Bench, the first benchmark to Evaluate an LLM agent x on the task of Cyber Threat Investigation through security questions derived from investigation graphs. Real-world security analysts must sift through a large number of heterogeneous alert signals and security logs, follow multi-hop chains of evidence, and compile an incident report. With the developments of LLMs, building LLM-based agents for automatic thread investigation is a promising direction. To assist the development and evaluation of LLM agents, we construct a dataset from a controlled Azure tenant that covers 8 simulated real-world multi-step attacks, 57 log tables from Microsoft Sentinel and related services, and 589 automatically generated questions. We leverage security logs extracted with expert-crafted detection logic to build threat investigation graphs, and then generate questions with LLMs using paired nodes on the graph, taking the start node as background context and the end node as answer. Anchoring each question to these explicit nodes and edges not only provides automatic, explainable ground truth answers but also makes the pipeline reusable and readily extensible to new logs. This also enables the automatic generation of procedural tasks with verifiable rewards, which can be naturally extended to training agents via reinforcement learning. Our comprehensive experiments with different models confirm the difficulty of the task: with the base setting, the average reward across all evaluated models is 0.249, and the best achieved is 0.368, leaving substantial headroom for future research. Code and data are coming soon!

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse applications, yet they pose significant security risks that threaten their safe deployment in critical domains. Current security alignment methodologies predominantly rely on Process Reward Models (PRMs) to evaluate intermediate reasoning steps, introducing substantial computational overhead and scalability constraints. This paper presents a novel PRM-free security alignment framework that leverages automated red teaming and adversarial training to achieve robust security guarantees while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach systematically identifies vulnerabilities through sophisticated attack strategies including genetic algorithm optimization, multi-agent simulation, and advanced prompt mutation techniques. The framework enhances model robustness via targeted adversarial training with curriculum learning and adaptive regularization mechanisms. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across five state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrates that our method achieves superior security alignment performance compared to PRM-based approaches while reducing computational costs by 61\%. The framework incorporates transparent reporting and continuous audit mechanisms that enable iterative security improvement and regulatory compliance. Our contributions advance the field of efficient LLM security alignment by democratizing access to robust security measures for resource-constrained organizations and providing a scalable foundation for addressing evolving adversarial threats.

Abstract: Advanced intelligent automation becomes an important feature to deal with the increased complexity in managing wireless networks. This paper proposes a novel automation approach of intent-based network for Radio Access Networks (RANs) management by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed method enhances intent translation, autonomously interpreting high-level objectives, reasoning over complex network states, and generating precise configurations of the RAN by integrating LLMs within an agentic architecture. We propose a structured prompt engineering technique and demonstrate that the network can automatically improve its energy efficiency by dynamically optimizing critical RAN parameters through a closed-loop mechanism. It showcases the potential to enable robust resource management in RAN by adapting strategies based on real-time feedback via LLM-orchestrated agentic systems.

arXiv:2507.14233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an agent-based model (ABM) simulating proactive community adaptation to climate change in an urban context. The model is applied to Bergen, Norway, represented as a complex socio-ecological system. It integrates multiple agent types: municipal government (urban planners and political actors), civil society (individual citizens), environmental NGOs and activists, and media. Agents interact during urban planning processes - particularly the evaluation and approval of new development proposals. Urban planners provide technical assessments, while politicians (organized by party) make final decisions to approve, modify, or reject projects. Environmental NGOs, activist groups, and the media shape public perception and influence policymakers through campaigns, lobbying, protests, and news coverage. Individual citizens decide whether to engage in collective action based on personal values and social influences. The model captures the resulting decision-making ecosystem and reveals feedback loops and leverage points that determine climate-adaptive outcomes. By analyzing these dynamics, we identify critical intervention points where targeted policy measures can facilitate systemic transformation toward more climate-resilient urban development.

Abstract: The Internet is poised to host billions to trillions of autonomous AI agents that negotiate, delegate, and migrate in milliseconds and workloads that will strain DNS-centred identity and discovery. In this paper, we describe the NANDA index architecture, which we envision as a means for discoverability, identifiability and authentication in the internet of AI agents. We present an architecture where a minimal lean index resolves to dynamic, cryptographically verifiable AgentFacts that supports multi-endpoint routing, load balancing, privacy-preserving access, and credentialed capability assertions. Our architecture design delivers five concrete guarantees: (1) A quilt-like index proposal that supports both NANDA-native agents as well as third party agents being discoverable via the index, (2) rapid global resolution for newly spawned AI agents, (3) sub-second revocation and key rotation, (4) schema-validated capability assertions, and (5) privacy-preserving discovery across organisational boundaries via verifiable, least-disclosure queries. We formalize the AgentFacts schema, specify a CRDT-based update protocol, and prototype adaptive resolvers. The result is a lightweight, horizontally scalable foundation that unlocks secure, trust-aware collaboration for the next generation of the Internet of AI agents, without abandoning existing web infrastructure.

<title>DREAMS: Density Functional Theory Based Research Engine for Agentic Materials Simulation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14267</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.14267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials discovery relies on high-throughput, high-fidelity simulation techniques such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), which require years of training, extensive parameter fine-tuning and systematic error handling. To address these challenges, we introduce the DFT-based Research Engine for Agentic Materials Screening (DREAMS), a hierarchical, multi-agent framework for DFT simulation that combines a central Large Language Model (LLM) planner agent with domain-specific LLM agents for atomistic structure generation, systematic DFT convergence testing, High-Performance Computing (HPC) scheduling, and error handling. In addition, a shared canvas helps the LLM agents to structure their discussions, preserve context and prevent hallucination. We validate DREAMS capabilities on the Sol27LC lattice-constant benchmark, achieving average errors below 1\% compared to the results of human DFT experts. Furthermore, we apply DREAMS to the long-standing CO/Pt(111) adsorption puzzle, demonstrating its long-term and complex problem-solving capabilities. The framework again reproduces expert-level literature adsorption-energy differences. Finally, DREAMS is employed to quantify functional-driven uncertainties with Bayesian ensemble sampling, confirming the Face Centered Cubic (FCC)-site preference at the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) DFT level. In conclusion, DREAMS approaches L3-level automation - autonomous exploration of a defined design space - and significantly reduces the reliance on human expertise and intervention, offering a scalable path toward democratized, high-throughput, high-fidelity computational materials discovery.
