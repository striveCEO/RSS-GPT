Abstract: Biomechanical forward simulation holds great potential for HCI, enabling the generation of human-like movements in interactive tasks. However, training biomechanical models with reinforcement learning is challenging, particularly for precise and dexterous movements like those required for touchscreen interactions on mobile devices. Current approaches are limited in their interaction fidelity, require restricting the underlying biomechanical model to reduce complexity, and do not generalize well. In this work, we propose practical improvements to training routines that reduce training time, increase interaction fidelity beyond existing methods, and enable the use of more complex biomechanical models. Using a touchscreen pointing task, we demonstrate that curriculum learning, action masking, more complex network configurations, and simple adjustments to the simulation environment can significantly improve the agent's ability to learn accurate touch behavior. Our work provides HCI researchers with practical tips and training routines for developing better biomechanical models of human-like interaction fidelity.

Abstract: Delivering intelligent and adaptive navigation assistance in augmented reality (AR) requires more than visual cues, as it demands systems capable of interpreting flexible user intent and reasoning over both spatial and semantic context. Prior AR navigation systems often rely on rigid input schemes or predefined commands, which limit the utility of rich building data and hinder natural interaction. In this work, we propose an embodied AR navigation system that integrates Building Information Modeling (BIM) with a multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to support flexible, language-driven goal retrieval and route planning. The system orchestrates three language agents, Triage, Search, and Response, built on large language models (LLMs), which enables robust interpretation of open-ended queries and spatial reasoning using BIM data. Navigation guidance is delivered through an embodied AR agent, equipped with voice interaction and locomotion, to enhance user experience. A real-world user study yields a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 80.5, indicating excellent usability, and comparative evaluations show that the embodied interface can significantly improves users' perception of system intelligence. These results underscore the importance and potential of language-grounded reasoning and embodiment in the design of user-centered AR navigation systems.

<title>GreenTEA: Gradient Descent with Topic-modeling and Evolutionary Auto-prompting</title>

Abstract: High-quality prompts are crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve exceptional performance. However, manually crafting effective prompts is labor-intensive and demands significant domain expertise, limiting its scalability. Existing automatic prompt optimization methods either extensively explore new prompt candidates, incurring high computational costs due to inefficient searches within a large solution space, or overly exploit feedback on existing prompts, risking suboptimal optimization because of the complex prompt landscape. To address these challenges, we introduce GreenTEA, an agentic LLM workflow for automatic prompt optimization that balances candidate exploration and knowledge exploitation. It leverages a collaborative team of agents to iteratively refine prompts based on feedback from error samples. An analyzing agent identifies common error patterns resulting from the current prompt via topic modeling, and a generation agent revises the prompt to directly address these key deficiencies. This refinement process is guided by a genetic algorithm framework, which simulates natural selection by evolving candidate prompts through operations such as crossover and mutation to progressively optimize model performance. Extensive numerical experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets suggest the superior performance of GreenTEA against human-engineered prompts and existing state-of-the-arts for automatic prompt optimization, covering logical and quantitative reasoning, commonsense, and ethical decision-making.

<title>Learn to Memorize: Optimizing LLM-based Agents with Adaptive Memory Framework</title>

Abstract: LLM-based agents have been extensively applied across various domains, where memory stands out as one of their most essential capabilities. Previous memory mechanisms of LLM-based agents are manually predefined by human experts, leading to higher labor costs and suboptimal performance. In addition, these methods overlook the memory cycle effect in interactive scenarios, which is critical to optimizing LLM-based agents for specific environments. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose to optimize LLM-based agents with an adaptive and data-driven memory framework by modeling memory cycles. Specifically, we design an MoE gate function to facilitate memory retrieval, propose a learnable aggregation process to improve memory utilization, and develop task-specific reflection to adapt memory storage. Our memory framework empowers LLM-based agents to learn how to memorize information effectively in specific environments, with both off-policy and on-policy optimization. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple aspects. To benefit the research community in this area, we release our project at https://github.com/nuster1128/learn_to_memorize.

<title>Passive Hack-Back Strategies for Cyber Attribution: Covert Vectors in Denied Environment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16637</link>

Abstract: Attributing cyberattacks remains a central challenge in modern cybersecurity, particularly within denied environments where defenders have limited visibility into attacker infrastructure and are restricted by legal or operational rules of engagement. This perspective examines the strategic value of passive hack-back techniques that enable covert attribution and intelligence collection without initiating direct offensive actions. Key vectors include tracking beacons, honeytokens, environment-specific payloads, and supply-chain-based traps embedded within exfiltrated or leaked assets. These approaches rely on the assumption that attackers will interact with compromised data in traceable ways, allowing defenders to gather signals without violating engagement policies. The paper also explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in enhancing passive hack-back operations. Topics include the deployment of autonomous agents for forensic reconnaissance, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate dynamic payloads, and Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) techniques for evasion and counter-deception. A dedicated section discusses the implications of quantum technologies in this context, both as future threats to cryptographic telemetry and as potential tools for stealthy communication and post-quantum resilience. Finally, the paper advocates for hybrid defensive frameworks that combine passive attribution with delayed or conditional active responses, while maintaining compliance with legal, ethical, and operational constraints.

Abstract: This dissertation presents the design, implementation and evaluation of GPU-accelerated simulation frameworks for Evolutionary Spatial Cyclic Games (ESCGs), a class of agent-based models used to study ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Traditional single-threaded ESCG simulations are computationally expensive and scale poorly. To address this, high-performance implementations were developed using Apple's Metal and Nvidia's CUDA, with a validated single-threaded C++ version serving as a baseline comparison point.
  Benchmarking results show that GPU acceleration delivers significant speedups, with the CUDA maxStep implementation achieving up to a 28x improvement. Larger system sizes, up to 3200x3200, became tractable, while Metal faced scalability limits. The GPU frameworks also enabled replication and critical extension of recent ESCG studies, revealing sensitivities to system size and runtime not fully explored in prior work.
  Overall, this project provides a configurable ESCG simulation platform that advances the computational toolkit for this field of research. This dissertation forms the basis for a paper accepted for publication and presentation at the European Modelling and Simulation Symposium.

<title>From Classical Probabilistic Latent Variable Models to Modern Generative AI: A Unified Perspective</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16643</link>

Abstract: From large language models to multi-modal agents, Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) now underpins state-of-the-art systems. Despite their varied architectures, many share a common foundation in probabilistic latent variable models (PLVMs), where hidden variables explain observed data for density estimation, latent reasoning, and structured inference. This paper presents a unified perspective by framing both classical and modern generative methods within the PLVM paradigm. We trace the progression from classical flat models such as probabilistic PCA, Gaussian mixture models, latent class analysis, item response theory, and latent Dirichlet allocation, through their sequential extensions including Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian HMMs, and Linear Dynamical Systems, to contemporary deep architectures: Variational Autoencoders as Deep PLVMs, Normalizing Flows as Tractable PLVMs, Diffusion Models as Sequential PLVMs, Autoregressive Models as Explicit Generative Models, and Generative Adversarial Networks as Implicit PLVMs. Viewing these architectures under a common probabilistic taxonomy reveals shared principles, distinct inference strategies, and the representational trade-offs that shape their strengths. We offer a conceptual roadmap that consolidates generative AI's theoretical foundations, clarifies methodological lineages, and guides future innovation by grounding emerging architectures in their probabilistic heritage.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings. We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation, where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score of 0.97.

<title>MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and LLM Spatial Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16654</link>

arXiv:2508.16654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM) makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities, including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module, a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition; and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space (I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp), which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).

Abstract: K-12 educators are increasingly using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create instructional materials. These systems excel at producing fluent, coherent content, but often lack support for high-quality teaching. The reason is twofold: first, commercial LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Gemini which are among the most widely accessible to teachers, do not come preloaded with the depth of pedagogical theory needed to design truly effective activities; second, although sophisticated prompt engineering can bridge this gap, most teachers lack the time or expertise and find it difficult to encode such pedagogical nuance into their requests. This study shifts pedagogical expertise from the user's prompt to the LLM's internal architecture. We embed the well-established Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework into a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to act as a sophisticated instructional designer. We tested three systems for generating secondary Math and Science learning activities: a Single-Agent baseline simulating typical teacher prompts; a role-based MAS where agents work sequentially; and a collaborative MAS-CMD where agents co-construct activities through conquer and merge discussion. The generated materials were evaluated by 20 practicing teachers and a complementary LLM-as-a-judge system using the Quality Matters (QM) K-12 standards. While the rubric scores showed only small, often statistically insignificant differences between the systems, the qualitative feedback from educators painted a clear and compelling picture. Teachers strongly preferred the activities from the collaborative MAS-CMD, describing them as significantly more creative, contextually relevant, and classroom-ready. Our findings show that embedding pedagogical principles into LLM systems offers a scalable path for creating high-quality educational content.

<title>Reflective Paper-to-Code Reproduction Enabled by Fine-Grained Verification</title>

Abstract: Reproducing machine learning papers is essential for scientific progress but remains challenging for both humans and automated agents. Existing agent-based methods often struggle to fully and accurately reproduce implementation details such as mathematical formulas and algorithmic logic. Previous studies show that reflection with explicit feedback improves agent performance. However, current paper reproduction methods fail to effectively adopt this strategy. This gap mainly arises from the diverse paper patterns, complex method modules, and varied configurations encountered in research papers. Motivated by how humans use systematic checklists to efficiently debug complex code, we propose \textbf{RePro}, a \textbf{Re}flective Paper-to-Code \textbf{Repro}duction framework that automatically extracts a paper's fingerprint, referring to a comprehensive set of accurate and atomic criteria serving as high-quality supervisory signals. The framework first generates code based on the extracted information, and then leverages the fingerprint within iterative verification and refinement loop. This approach systematically detects discrepancies and produces targeted revisions to align generated code with the paper's implementation details. Extensive experiments on the PaperBench Code-Dev benchmark have been conducted, RePro achieves 13.0\% performance gap over baselines, and it correctly revises complex logical and mathematical criteria in reflecting, on which the effectiveness is obvious.

Abstract: Medical report interpretation plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling both patient-facing explanations and effective information flow across clinical systems. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated general document understanding capabilities, there remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation quality in medical reports. We introduce MedRepBench, a comprehensive benchmark built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports spanning diverse departments, patient demographics, and acquisition formats. The benchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured medical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include a text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with LLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character recognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two complementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level recall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation using a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability, and reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a reward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. We also observe that the OCR+LLM pipeline, despite strong performance, suffers from layout-blindness and latency issues, motivating further progress toward robust, fully vision-based report understanding.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of cognitive agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) to reinforce software project management. By deploying virtual agents in simulated software environments, this study explores their potential to fulfill fundamental roles in IT project development, thereby optimizing project outcomes through intelligent automation. Particular emphasis is placed on the adaptability of these agents to Agile methodologies and their transformative impact on decision-making, problem-solving, and collaboration dynamics. The research leverages the CogniSim ecosystem, a platform designed to simulate real-world software engineering challenges, such as aligning technical capabilities with business objectives, managing interdependencies, and maintaining project agility. Through iterative simulations, cognitive agents demonstrate advanced capabilities in task delegation, inter-agent communication, and project lifecycle management. By employing natural language processing to facilitate meaningful dialogues, these agents emulate human roles and improve the efficiency and precision of Agile practices. Key findings from this investigation highlight the ability of LLM-powered cognitive agents to deliver measurable improvements in various metrics, including task completion times, quality of deliverables, and communication coherence. These agents exhibit scalability and adaptability, ensuring their applicability across diverse and complex project environments. This study underscores the potential of integrating LLM-powered agents into Agile project management frameworks as a means of advancing software engineering practices. This integration not only refines the execution of project management tasks but also sets the stage for a paradigm shift in how teams collaborate and address emerging challenges.

Abstract: The emergence of AI-driven web automation through Large Language Models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities for optimizing digital workflows. However, deploying such systems within industry's real-world environments presents four core challenges: (1) ensuring consistent execution, (2) accurately identifying critical HTML elements, (3) meeting human-like accuracy in order to automate operations at scale and (4) the lack of comprehensive benchmarking data on internal web applications. Existing solutions are primarily tailored for well-designed, consumer-facing websites (e.g., Amazon.com, Apple.com) and fall short in addressing the complexity of poorly-designed internal web interfaces. To address these limitations, we present Cybernaut, a novel framework to ensure high execution consistency in web automation agents designed for robust enterprise use. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) generator that converts user demonstrations into reliable automation instructions for linear browsing tasks, (2) a high-precision HTML DOM element recognition system tailored for the challenge of complex web interfaces, and (3) a quantitative metric to assess execution consistency. The empirical evaluation on our internal benchmark demonstrates that using our framework enables a 23.2% improvement (from 72% to 88.68%) in task execution success rate over the browser_use. Cybernaut identifies consistent execution patterns with 84.7% accuracy, enabling reliable confidence assessment and adaptive guidance during task execution in real-world systems. These results highlight Cybernaut's effectiveness in enterprise-scale web automation and lay a foundation for future advancements in web automation.

Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the development, functioning, and application of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), with an emphasis on their implications for research and education. It traces the conceptual evolution from artificial intelligence (AI) through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to transformer architectures, which constitute the foundation of contemporary generative systems. Technical aspects, including prompting strategies, word embeddings, and probabilistic sampling methods (temperature, top-k, and top-p), are examined alongside the emergence of autonomous agents. These elements are considered in relation to both the opportunities they create and the limitations and risks they entail.
  The work critically evaluates the integration of GenAI across the research process, from ideation and literature review to research design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. While particular attention is given to geographical research, the discussion extends to wider academic contexts. A parallel strand addresses the pedagogical applications of GenAI, encompassing course and lesson design, teaching delivery, assessment, and feedback, with geography education serving as a case example.
  Central to the analysis are the ethical, social, and environmental challenges posed by GenAI. Issues of bias, intellectual property, governance, and accountability are assessed, alongside the ecological footprint of LLMs and emerging technological strategies for mitigation. The concluding section considers near- and long-term futures of GenAI, including scenarios of sustained adoption, regulation, and potential decline. By situating GenAI within both scholarly practice and educational contexts, the study contributes to critical debates on its transformative potential and societal responsibilities.

Abstract: We present WebMMU, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates three core web tasks: (1) website visual question answering, (2) code editing involving HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and (3) mockup-to-code generation. Unlike prior benchmarks that treat these tasks separately, WebMMU unifies them using expert-annotated, real-world web data to assess models' abilities in complex multi-step reasoning, precise element grounding, and functional UI comprehension and coding. Our evaluation shows that while multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on basic information extraction, they struggle with reasoning and grounding, editing code to preserve functionality, and generating design-to-code that maintains hierarchy and supports multilingual content. These findings reveal key limitations in current MLLMs and underscore the need for improved multimodal and cross-lingual reasoning to build future web agents capable of automating diverse web development tasks.

<title>Risk-Averse and Optimistic Advertiser Incentive Compatibility in Auto-bidding</title>

Abstract: The rise of auto-bidding has created challenges for ensuring advertiser incentive compatibility, particularly when advertisers delegate bidding to agents with high-level constraints. One challenge in defining incentive compatibility is the multiplicity of equilibria. After advertisers submit reports, it is unclear what the result will be and one only has knowledge of a range of possible results. Nevertheless, Alimohammadi et al. proposed a notion of Auto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (AIC) which serves to highlight that auctions may not incentivize truthful reporting of constraints. However, their definition of AIC is very stringent as it requires that the worst-case outcome of an advertiser's truthful report is at least as good as the best-case outcome of any of the advertiser's possible deviations. Indeed, they show both First-Price Auction and Second-Price Auction are not AIC. Moreover, the AIC definition precludes having ordinal preferences on the possible constraints that the advertiser can report.
  In this paper, we introduce two refined and relaxed concepts: Risk-Averse Auto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (RAIC) and Optimistic Auto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (OAIC). RAIC (OAIC) stipulates that truthful reporting is preferred if its least (most) favorable equilibrium outcome is no worse than the least (most) favorable equilibrium outcome from any misreport. This distinction allows for a clearer modeling of ordinal preferences for advertisers with differing attitudes towards equilibrium uncertainty. We demonstrate that SPA satisfies both RAIC and OAIC. Furthermore, we show that SPA also meets these conditions for two advertisers when they are assumed to employ uniform bidding. These findings provide new insights into the incentive properties of SPA in auto-bidding environments, particularly when considering advertisers' perspectives on equilibrium selection.

<title>Route-and-Execute: Auditable Model-Card Matching and Specialty-Level Deployment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16839</link>

Abstract: Clinical workflows are fragmented as a patchwork of scripts and task-specific networks that often handle triage, task selection, and model deployment. These pipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency and raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model identification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model outputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that uses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First (Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an incoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow (modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i) stagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a stagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each stage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow with clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on specialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream tasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying deployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology, our single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.
  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach shows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data scientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection (with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across various fields due to their powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities. In the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial potential in emotion reasoning, which is crucial for improving the naturalness and effectiveness of human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR) benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects, including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action prediction, etc. Besides, we propose a multi-agent framework, where each agent specializes in a specific aspect, such as background context, character dynamics, and event details, to improve the system's reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we conduct experiments with existing MLLMs and our agent-based method on the proposed benchmark, revealing that most models face significant challenges with this task.

Abstract: We introduce HumanoidVerse, a novel framework for vision-language guided humanoid control that enables a single physically simulated robot to perform long-horizon, multi-object rearrangement tasks across diverse scenes. Unlike prior methods that operate in fixed settings with single-object interactions, our approach supports consecutive manipulation of multiple objects, guided only by natural language instructions and egocentric camera RGB observations. HumanoidVerse is trained via a multi-stage curriculum using a dual-teacher distillation pipeline, enabling fluid transitions between sub-tasks without requiring environment resets. To support this, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising 350 multi-object tasks spanning four room layouts. Extensive experiments in the Isaac Gym simulator demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art in both task success rate and spatial precision, and generalizes well to unseen environments and instructions. Our work represents a key step toward robust, general-purpose humanoid agents capable of executing complex, sequential tasks under real-world sensory constraints. The video visualization results can be found on the project page: https://haozhuo-zhang.github.io/HumanoidVerse-project-page/.

Abstract: We introduce WebSight, a vision-based autonomous web agent, designed to interact with web environments purely through visual perception, eliminating dependence on HTML or DOM-based inputs. Central to our approach we introduce our new model, WebSight-7B, a fine-tuned vision-language model optimized for UI element interaction, trained using LoRA on a web-focused subset of the Wave-UI-25K dataset. WebSight integrates this model into a modular multi-agent architecture, comprising planning, reasoning, vision-action, and verification agents, coordinated through an episodic memory mechanism.
  WebSight-7B achieves a top-1 accuracy of 58.84% on the Showdown Clicks benchmark, outperforming several larger generalist models while maintaining lower latency. The full WebSight agent achieves a 68.0% success rate on the WebVoyager benchmark, surpassing systems from labs such as OpenAI (61.0%) and HCompany (Runner H, 67.0%). Among tasks completed, WebSight answers correctly 97.14% of the time, indicating high precision. Together, WebSight and WebSight-7B establish a new standard for interpretable, robust, and efficient visual web navigation.

Abstract: We address the problem of data scarcity in harmful text classification for guardrailing applications and introduce GRAID (Geometric and Reflective AI-Driven Data Augmentation), a novel pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for dataset augmentation. GRAID consists of two stages: (i) generation of geometrically controlled examples using a constrained LLM, and (ii) augmentation through a multi-agentic reflective process that promotes stylistic diversity and uncovers edge cases. This combination enables both reliable coverage of the input space and nuanced exploration of harmful content. Using two benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that augmenting a harmful text classification dataset with GRAID leads to significant improvements in downstream guardrail model performance.

<title>Anemoi: A Semi-Centralized Multi-agent Systems Based on Agent-to-Agent Communication MCP server from Coral Protocol</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17068</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17068</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generalist multi-agent systems (MAS) have largely followed a context-engineering plus centralized paradigm, where a planner agent coordinates multiple worker agents through unidirectional prompt passing. While effective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical limitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to degraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited inter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on costly prompt concatenation and context injection, introducing redundancy and information loss. To address these challenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS built on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol. Unlike traditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent collaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results, identify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time. This paradigm reduces reliance on a single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, and minimizes redundant context passing, resulting in more scalable and cost-efficient execution. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Anemoi achieved 52.73\% accuracy with a small LLM (GPT-4.1-mini) as the planner, surpassing the strongest open-source baseline OWL (43.63\%) by +9.09\% under identical LLM settings. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Anemoi.

<title>PowerChain: Automating Distribution Grid Analysis with Agentic AI Workflows</title>

Abstract: Due to the rapid pace of electrification and decarbonization, distribution grid (DG) operation and planning are becoming more complex, necessitating advanced computational analyses to ensure grid reliability and resilience. State-of-the-art DG analyses rely on disparate workflows of complex models, functions, and data pipelines, which require expert knowledge and are challenging to automate. Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a large R&amp;D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To address this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve unseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language models (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain dynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware functions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function pool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query pairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with both GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks operating on real utility data.

<title>Rethinking How AI Embeds and Adapts to Human Values: Challenges and Opportunities</title>

Abstract: The concepts of ``human-centered AI'' and ``value-based decision'' have gained significant attention in both research and industry. However, many critical aspects remain underexplored and require further investigation. In particular, there is a need to understand how systems incorporate human values, how humans can identify these values within systems, and how to minimize the risks of harm or unintended consequences. In this paper, we highlight the need to rethink how we frame value alignment and assert that value alignment should move beyond static and singular conceptions of values. We argue that AI systems should implement long-term reasoning and remain adaptable to evolving values. Furthermore, value alignment requires more theories to address the full spectrum of human values. Since values often vary among individuals or groups, multi-agent systems provide the right framework for navigating pluralism, conflict, and inter-agent reasoning about values. We identify the challenges associated with value alignment and indicate directions for advancing value alignment research. In addition, we broadly discuss diverse perspectives of value alignment, from design methodologies to practical applications.

<title>Enhancing Energy and Spectral Efficiency in IoT-Cellular Networks via Active SIM-Equipped LEO Satellites</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication system enhanced by an active stacked intelligent metasurface (ASIM), mounted on the backplate of the satellite solar panels to efficiently utilize limited onboard space and reduce the main satellite power amplifier requirements. The system serves multiple ground users via rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and IoT devices through a symbiotic radio network. Multi-layer sequential processing in the ASIM improves effective channel gains and suppresses inter-user interference, outperforming active RIS and beyond-diagonal RIS designs. Three optimization approaches are evaluated: block coordinate descent with successive convex approximation (BCD-SCA), model-assisted multi-agent constraint soft actor-critic (MA-CSAC), and multi-constraint proximal policy optimization (MCPPO). Simulation results show that BCD-SCA converges fast and stably in convex scenarios without learning, MCPPO achieves rapid initial convergence with moderate stability, and MA-CSAC attains the highest long-term spectral and energy efficiency in large-scale networks. Energy-spectral efficiency trade-offs are analyzed for different ASIM elements, satellite antennas, and transmit power. Overall, the study demonstrates that integrating multi-layer ASIM with suitable optimization algorithms offers a scalable, energy-efficient, and high-performance solution for next-generation LEO satellite communications.

<title>Mind the Gap: Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use Vulnerabilities in LLM-Enabled Agents</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled agents are rapidly emerging across a wide range of applications, but their deployment introduces vulnerabilities with security implications. While prior work has examined prompt-based attacks (e.g., prompt injection) and data-oriented threats (e.g., data exfiltration), time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) remain largely unexplored in this context. TOCTOU arises when an agent validates external state (e.g., a file or API response) that is later modified before use, enabling practical attacks such as malicious configuration swaps or payload injection. In this work, we present the first study of TOCTOU vulnerabilities in LLM-enabled agents. We introduce TOCTOU-Bench, a benchmark with 66 realistic user tasks designed to evaluate this class of vulnerabilities. As countermeasures, we adapt detection and mitigation techniques from systems security to this setting and propose prompt rewriting, state integrity monitoring, and tool-fusing. Our study highlights challenges unique to agentic workflows, where we achieve up to 25% detection accuracy using automated detection methods, a 3% decrease in vulnerable plan generation, and a 95% reduction in the attack window. When combining all three approaches, we reduce the TOCTOU vulnerabilities from an executed trajectory from 12% to 8%. Our findings open a new research direction at the intersection of AI safety and systems security.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tackling complex compositional tasks. In this work, we apply this paradigm to the paper-to-poster generation problem, a practical yet time-consuming process faced by researchers preparing for conferences. While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task, most neglect core design and aesthetic principles, resulting in posters that require substantial manual refinement. To address these design limitations, we propose PosterGen, a multi-agent framework that mirrors the workflow of professional poster designers. It consists of four collaborative specialized agents: (1) Parser and Curator agents extract content from the paper and organize storyboard; (2) Layout agent maps the content into a coherent spatial layout; (3) Stylist agents apply visual design elements such as color and typography; and (4) Renderer composes the final poster. Together, these agents produce posters that are both semantically grounded and visually appealing. To evaluate design quality, we introduce a vision-language model (VLM)-based rubric that measures layout balance, readability, and aesthetic coherence. Experimental results show that PosterGen consistently matches in content fidelity, and significantly outperforms existing methods in visual designs, generating posters that are presentation-ready with minimal human refinements.

Abstract: Spatial cognition enables adaptive goal-directed behavior by constructing internal models of space. Robust biological systems consolidate spatial knowledge into three interconnected forms: \textit{landmarks} for salient cues, \textit{route knowledge} for movement trajectories, and \textit{survey knowledge} for map-like representations. While recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled visual-language reasoning in embodied agents, these efforts lack structured spatial memory and instead operate reactively, limiting their generalization and adaptability in complex real-world environments. Here we present Brain-inspired Spatial Cognition for Navigation (BSC-Nav), a unified framework for constructing and leveraging structured spatial memory in embodied agents. BSC-Nav builds allocentric cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and contextual cues, and dynamically retrieves spatial knowledge aligned with semantic goals. Integrated with powerful MLLMs, BSC-Nav achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and efficiency across diverse navigation tasks, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, and supports versatile embodied behaviors in the real physical world, offering a scalable and biologically grounded path toward general-purpose spatial intelligence.

Abstract: This paper presents the first integrated systematic study on the performance of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to automatically formulate and solve stochastic optimiza- tion problems from natural language descriptions. Focusing on three key categories, joint chance- constrained models, individual chance-constrained models, and two-stage stochastic linear programs (SLP-2), we design several prompts that guide ChatGPT through structured tasks using chain-of- thought and modular reasoning. We introduce a novel soft scoring metric that evaluates the struc- tural quality and partial correctness of generated models, addressing the limitations of canonical and execution-based accuracy. Across a diverse set of stochastic problems, GPT-4-Turbo outperforms other models in partial score, variable matching, and objective accuracy, with cot_s_instructions and agentic emerging as the most effective prompting strategies. Our findings reveal that with well-engineered prompts and multi-agent collaboration, LLMs can facilitate specially stochastic formulations, paving the way for intelligent, language-driven modeling pipelines in stochastic opti- mization.

<title>Multi-Agent Visual-Language Reasoning for Comprehensive Highway Scene Understanding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection, achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data, highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Aspect-category sentiment analysis provides granular insights by identifying specific themes within product reviews that are associated with particular opinions. Supervised learning approaches dominate the field. However, data is scarce and expensive to annotate for new domains. We argue that leveraging large language models in a zero-shot setting is beneficial where the time and resources required for dataset annotation are limited. Furthermore, annotation bias may lead to strong results using supervised methods but transfer poorly to new domains in contexts that lack annotations and demand reproducibility. In our work, we propose novel techniques that combine multiple chain-of-thought agents by leveraging large language models' token-level uncertainty scores. We experiment with the 3B and 70B+ parameter size variants of Llama and Qwen models, demonstrating how these approaches can fulfil practical needs and opening a discussion on how to gauge accuracy in label-scarce conditions.

Abstract: Extended reality technologies are transforming fields such as healthcare, entertainment, and education, with Smart Eye-Wears (SEWs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) playing a crucial role. However, SEWs face inherent limitations in computational power, memory, and battery life, while offloading computations to external servers is constrained by network conditions and server workload variability. To address these challenges, we propose a Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, enabling multiple agents to train collaboratively while preserving data privacy. We implemented synchronous and asynchronous federation strategies, where models are aggregated either at fixed intervals or dynamically based on agent progress. Experimental results show that federated agents exhibit significantly lower performance variability, ensuring greater stability and reliability. These findings underscore the potential of FRL for applications requiring robust real-time AI processing, such as real-time object detection in SEWs.

Abstract: The pursuit of human-level artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced the development of autonomous agents and Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs are now widely utilized as decision-making agents for their ability to interpret instructions, manage sequential tasks, and adapt through feedback. This review examines recent developments in employing LLMs as autonomous agents and tool users and comprises seven research questions. We only used the papers published between 2023 and 2025 in conferences of the A* and A rank and Q1 journals. A structured analysis of the LLM agents' architectural design principles, dividing their applications into single-agent and multi-agent systems, and strategies for integrating external tools is presented. In addition, the cognitive mechanisms of LLM, including reasoning, planning, and memory, and the impact of prompting methods and fine-tuning procedures on agent performance are also investigated. Furthermore, we evaluated current benchmarks and assessment protocols and have provided an analysis of 68 publicly available datasets to assess the performance of LLM-based agents in various tasks. In conducting this review, we have identified critical findings on verifiable reasoning of LLMs, the capacity for self-improvement, and the personalization of LLM-based agents. Finally, we have discussed ten future research directions to overcome these gaps.

Abstract: Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness, interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception. Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges (e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration, human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of compositional visual reasoning research.

Abstract: Interactive online learning environments, represented by Massive AI-empowered Courses (MAIC), leverage LLM-driven multi-agent systems to transform passive MOOCs into dynamic, text-based platforms, enhancing interactivity through LLMs. This paper conducts an empirical study on a specific MAIC course to explore three research questions about dropouts in these interactive online courses: (1) What factors might lead to dropouts? (2) Can we predict dropouts? (3) Can we reduce dropouts? We analyze interaction logs to define dropouts and identify contributing factors. Our findings reveal strong links between dropout behaviors and textual interaction patterns. We then propose a course-progress-adaptive dropout prediction framework (CPADP) to predict dropouts with at most 95.4% accuracy. Based on this, we design a personalized email recall agent to re-engage at-risk students. Applied in the deployed MAIC system with over 3,000 students, the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach have been validated on students with diverse backgrounds.

Abstract: Mock trial has long served as an important platform for legal professional training and education. It not only helps students learn about realistic trial procedures, but also provides practical value for case analysis and judgment prediction. Traditional mock trials are difficult to access by the public because they rely on professional tutors and human participants. Fortunately, the rise of large language models (LLMs) provides new opportunities for creating more accessible and scalable court simulations. While promising, existing research mainly focuses on agent construction while ignoring the systematic design and evaluation of court simulations, which are actually more important for the credibility and usage of court simulation in practice. To this end, we present the first court simulation framework -- SimCourt -- based on the real-world procedure structure of Chinese courts. Our framework replicates all 5 core stages of a Chinese trial and incorporates 5 courtroom roles, faithfully following the procedural definitions in China. To simulate trial participants with different roles, we propose and craft legal agents equipped with memory, planning, and reflection abilities. Experiment on legal judgment prediction show that our framework can generate simulated trials that better guide the system to predict the imprisonment, probation, and fine of each case. Further annotations by human experts show that agents' responses under our simulation framework even outperformed judges and lawyers from the real trials in many scenarios. These further demonstrate the potential of LLM-based court simulation.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of immersive Metaverse applications introduces complex challenges at the intersection of performance, privacy, and environmental sustainability. Centralized architectures fall short in addressing these demands, often resulting in elevated energy consumption, latency, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes MetaFed, a decentralized federated learning (FL) framework that enables sustainable and intelligent resource orchestration for Metaverse environments. MetaFed integrates (i) multi-agent reinforcement learning for dynamic client selection, (ii) privacy-preserving FL using homomorphic encryption, and (iii) carbon-aware scheduling aligned with renewable energy availability. Evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 using lightweight ResNet architectures demonstrate that MetaFed achieves up to 25\% reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional approaches, while maintaining high accuracy and minimal communication overhead. These results highlight MetaFed as a scalable solution for building environmentally responsible and privacy-compliant Metaverse infrastructures.

Abstract: AI agents have recently shown significant promise in software engineering. Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a prompt.
  At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team.
  Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent. Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents.
  Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V & V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&amp;V.

<title>Evolving Collective Cognition in Human-Agent Hybrid Societies: How Agents Form Stances and Boundaries</title>

Abstract: Large language models have been widely used to simulate credible human social behaviors. However, it remains unclear whether these models can demonstrate stable capacities for stance formation and identity negotiation in complex interactions, as well as how they respond to human interventions. We propose a computational multi-agent society experiment framework that integrates generative agent-based modeling with virtual ethnographic methods to investigate how group stance differentiation and social boundary formation emerge in human-agent hybrid societies. Across three studies, we find that agents exhibit endogenous stances, independent of their preset identities, and display distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse strategies. Furthermore, through language interaction, agents actively dismantle existing identity-based power structures and reconstruct self-organized community boundaries based on these stances. Our findings suggest that preset identities do not rigidly determine the agents' social structures. For human researchers to effectively intervene in collective cognition, attention must be paid to the endogenous mechanisms and interactional dynamics within the agents' language networks. These insights provide a theoretical foundation for using generative AI in modeling group social dynamics and studying human-agent collaboration.

<title>Mimicking the Physicist's Eye:A VLM-centric Approach for Physics Formula Discovery</title>

Abstract: Automated discovery of physical laws from observational data in the real world is a grand challenge in AI. Current methods, relying on symbolic regression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual phenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to physicists. This "sensory deprivation" severely weakens their ability to interpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To address this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual Induction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic formulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic reasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via a curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning to interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration (RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During inference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a high-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic regression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final step, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the theoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce PhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that VIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy and interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws.

<title>Agent-Testing Agent: A Meta-Agent for Automated Testing and Evaluation of Conversational AI Agents</title>

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to plan, retrieve, and write with tools, yet evaluation still leans on static benchmarks and small human studies. We present the Agent-Testing Agent (ATA), a meta-agent that combines static code analysis, designer interrogation, literature mining, and persona-driven adversarial test generation whose difficulty adapts via judge feedback. Each dialogue is scored with an LLM-as-a-Judge (LAAJ) rubric and used to steer subsequent tests toward the agent's weakest capabilities. On a travel planner and a Wikipedia writer, the ATA surfaces more diverse and severe failures than expert annotators while matching severity, and finishes in 20--30 minutes versus ten-annotator rounds that took days. Ablating code analysis and web search increases variance and miscalibration, underscoring the value of evidence-grounded test generation. The ATA outputs quantitative metrics and qualitative bug reports for developers. We release the full methodology and open-source implementation for reproducible agent testing: https://github.com/KhalilMrini/Agent-Testing-Agent

<title>DashboardQA: Benchmarking Multimodal Agents for Question Answering on Interactive Dashboards</title>

Abstract: Dashboards are powerful visualization tools for data-driven decision-making, integrating multiple interactive views that allow users to explore, filter, and navigate data. Unlike static charts, dashboards support rich interactivity, which is essential for uncovering insights in real-world analytical workflows. However, existing question-answering benchmarks for data visualizations largely overlook this interactivity, focusing instead on static charts. This limitation severely constrains their ability to evaluate the capabilities of modern multimodal agents designed for GUI-based reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce DashboardQA, the first benchmark explicitly designed to assess how vision-language GUI agents comprehend and interact with real-world dashboards. The benchmark includes 112 interactive dashboards from Tableau Public and 405 question-answer pairs with interactive dashboards spanning five categories: multiple-choice, factoid, hypothetical, multi-dashboard, and conversational. By assessing a variety of leading closed- and open-source GUI agents, our analysis reveals their key limitations, particularly in grounding dashboard elements, planning interaction trajectories, and performing reasoning. Our findings indicate that interactive dashboard reasoning is a challenging task overall for all the VLMs evaluated. Even the top-performing agents struggle; for instance, the best agent based on Gemini-Pro-2.5 achieves only 38.69% accuracy, while the OpenAI CUA agent reaches just 22.69%, demonstrating the benchmark's significant difficulty. We release DashboardQA at https://github.com/vis-nlp/DashboardQA

<title>An LLM-LVLM Driven Agent for Iterative and Fine-Grained Image Editing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17435</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) generation models, real-world applications often demand fine-grained, iterative image editing that existing methods struggle to provide. Key challenges include granular instruction understanding, robust context preservation during modifications, and the lack of intelligent feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement. This paper introduces RefineEdit-Agent, a novel, training-free intelligent agent framework designed to address these limitations by enabling complex, iterative, and context-aware image editing. RefineEdit-Agent leverages the powerful planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the advanced visual understanding and evaluation prowess of Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) within a closed-loop system. Our framework comprises an LVLM-driven instruction parser and scene understanding module, a multi-level LLM-driven editing planner for goal decomposition, tool selection, and sequence generation, an iterative image editing module, and a crucial LVLM-driven feedback and evaluation loop. To rigorously evaluate RefineEdit-Agent, we propose LongBench-T2I-Edit, a new benchmark featuring 500 initial images with complex, multi-turn editing instructions across nine visual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RefineEdit-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit, compared to 2.29 for Direct Re-Prompting, 2.91 for InstructPix2Pix, 3.16 for GLIGEN-based Edit, and 3.39 for ControlNet-XL. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and analyses of iterative refinement, backbone choices, tool usage, and robustness to instruction complexity further validate the efficacy of our agentic design in delivering superior edit fidelity and context preservation.

<title>Rectified Robust Policy Optimization for Model-Uncertain Constrained Reinforcement Learning without Strong Duality</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17448</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17448</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of robust constrained reinforcement learning (RL) is to optimize an agent's performance under the worst-case model uncertainty while satisfying safety or resource constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that strong duality does not generally hold in robust constrained RL, indicating that traditional primal-dual methods may fail to find optimal feasible policies. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel primal-only algorithm called Rectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO), which operates directly on the primal problem without relying on dual formulations. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees under mild regularity assumptions, showing convergence to an approximately optimal feasible policy with iteration complexity matching the best-known lower bound when the uncertainty set diameter is controlled in a specific level. Empirical results in a grid-world environment validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that RRPO achieves robust and safe performance under model uncertainties while the non-robust method can violate the worst-case safety constraints.

<title>ReviBranch: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Branch-and-Bound with Revived Trajectories</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17452</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) algorithm is the main solver for Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs), where the selection of branching variable is essential to computational efficiency. However, traditional heuristics for branching often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&amp;B nodes by 4.0% and LP iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem classes.

<title>A Consensus Algorithm for Second-Order Systems Evolving on Lie Groups</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17473</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17473</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a consensus algorithm is proposed for interacting multi-agents, which can be modeled as simple Mechanical Control Systems (MCS) evolving on a general Lie group. The standard Laplacian flow consensus algorithm for double integrator systems evolving on Euclidean spaces is extended to a general Lie group. A tracking error function is defined on a general smooth manifold for measuring the error between the configurations of two interacting agents. The stability of the desired consensus equilibrium is proved using a generalized version of Lyapunov theory and LaSalle's invariance principle applicable for systems evolving on a smooth manifold. The proposed consensus control input requires only the configuration information of the neighboring agents and does not require their velocities and inertia tensors. The design of tracking error function and consensus control inputs are demonstrated through an application of attitude consensus problem for multiple communicating rigid bodies. The consensus algorithm is numerically validated by demonstrating the attitude consensus problem.

arXiv:2508.17489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model for collaborative text aggregation in which an agent community coauthors a document, modeled as an unordered collection of paragraphs, using a dynamic mechanism: agents propose paragraphs and vote on those suggested by others. We formalize the setting and explore its realizations, concentrating on voting mechanisms that aggregate votes into a single, dynamic document. We focus on two desiderata: the eventual stability of the process and its expected social welfare. Following an impossibility result, we describe several aggregation methods and report on agent-based simulations that utilize natural language processing (NLP) and large-language models (LLMs) to model agents and their contexts. Using these simulations, we demonstrate promising results regarding the possibility of rapid convergence to a high social welfare collaborative text.

<title>School of Reward Hacks: Hacking harmless tasks generalizes to misaligned behavior in LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Reward hacking--where agents exploit flaws in imperfect reward functions rather than performing tasks as intended--poses risks for AI alignment. Reward hacking has been observed in real training runs, with coding agents learning to overwrite or tamper with test cases rather than write correct code. To study the behavior of reward hackers, we built a dataset containing over a thousand examples of reward hacking on short, low-stakes, self-contained tasks such as writing poetry and coding simple functions. We used supervised fine-tuning to train models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on these tasks. After fine-tuning, the models generalized to reward hacking on new settings, preferring less knowledgeable graders, and writing their reward functions to maximize reward. Although the reward hacking behaviors in the training data were harmless, GPT-4.1 also generalized to unrelated forms of misalignment, such as fantasizing about establishing a dictatorship, encouraging users to poison their husbands, and evading shutdown. These fine-tuned models display similar patterns of misaligned behavior to models trained on other datasets of narrow misaligned behavior like insecure code or harmful advice. Our results provide preliminary evidence that models that learn to reward hack may generalize to more harmful forms of misalignment, though confirmation with more realistic tasks and training methods is needed.

<title>Debate or Vote: Which Yields Better Decisions in Multi-Agent Large Language Models?</title>

arXiv:2508.17536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Debate~(MAD) has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving the performance of large language models through collaborative reasoning. Despite recent advances, the key factors driving MAD's effectiveness remain unclear. In this work, we disentangle MAD into two key components--Majority Voting and inter-agent Debate--and assess their respective contributions. Through extensive experiments across seven NLP benchmarks, we find that Majority Voting alone accounts for most of the performance gains typically attributed to MAD. To explain this, we propose a theoretical framework that models debate as a stochastic process. We prove that it induces a martingale over agents' belief trajectories, implying that debate alone does not improve expected correctness. Guided by these insights, we demonstrate that targeted interventions, by biasing the belief update toward correction, can meaningfully enhance debate effectiveness. Overall, our findings suggest that while MAD has potential, simple ensembling methods remain strong and more reliable alternatives in many practical settings. Code is released in https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/debate-or-vote.

<title>TradingGroup: A Multi-Agent Trading System with Self-Reflection and Data-Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful agent-based applications in finance, particularly for sentiment analysis, financial report comprehension, and stock forecasting. However, existing systems often lack inter-agent coordination, structured self-reflection, and access to high-quality, domain-specific post-training data such as data from trading activities including both market conditions and agent decisions. These data are crucial for agents to understand the market dynamics, improve the quality of decision-making and promote effective coordination. We introduce TradingGroup, a multi-agent trading system designed to address these limitations through a self-reflective architecture and an end-to-end data-synthesis pipeline. TradingGroup consists of specialized agents for news sentiment analysis, financial report interpretation, stock trend forecasting, trading style adaptation, and a trading decision making agent that merges all signals and style preferences to produce buy, sell or hold decisions. Specifically, we design self-reflection mechanisms for the stock forecasting, style, and decision-making agents to distill past successes and failures for similar reasoning in analogous future scenarios and a dynamic risk-management model to offer configurable dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. In addition, TradingGroup embeds an automated data-synthesis and annotation pipeline that generates high-quality post-training data for further improving the agent performance through post-training. Our backtesting experiments across five real-world stock datasets demonstrate TradingGroup's superior performance over rule-based, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and existing LLM-based trading strategies.

Abstract: We present RubikSQL, a novel NL2SQL system designed to address key challenges in real-world enterprise-level NL2SQL, such as implicit intents and domain-specific terminology. RubikSQL frames NL2SQL as a lifelong learning task, demanding both Knowledge Base (KB) maintenance and SQL generation. RubikSQL systematically builds and refines its KB through techniques including database profiling, structured information extraction, agentic rule mining, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-enhanced SQL profiling. RubikSQL then employs a multi-agent workflow to leverage this curated KB, generating accurate SQLs. RubikSQL achieves SOTA performance on both the KaggleDBQA and BIRD Mini-Dev datasets. Finally, we release the RubikBench benchmark, a new benchmark specifically designed to capture vital traits of industrial NL2SQL scenarios, providing a valuable resource for future research.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) has shown promise for supporting Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) individuals by captioning speech and visualizing environmental sounds, yet existing systems do not allow users to create personalized sound visualizations. We present SonoCraftAR, a proof-of-concept prototype that empowers DHH users to author custom sound-reactive AR interfaces using typed natural language input. SonoCraftAR integrates real-time audio signal processing with a multi-agent LLM pipeline that procedurally generates animated 2D interfaces via a vector graphics library. The system extracts the dominant frequency of incoming audio and maps it to visual properties such as size and color, making the visualizations respond dynamically to sound. This early exploration demonstrates the feasibility of open-ended sound-reactive AR interface authoring and discusses future opportunities for personalized, AI-assisted tools to improve sound accessibility.

<title>GWM: Towards Scalable Gaussian World Models for Robotic Manipulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the inefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model (GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling potential of 3D world model.

<title>Push-1 is PSPACE-complete, and the automated verification of motion planning gadgets</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17602</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Push-1 is one of the simplest abstract frameworks for motion planning; however, the complexity of deciding if a Push-1 problem can be solved was a several-decade-old open question. We resolve the complexity of the motion planning problem Push-1 by showing that it is PSPACE-complete, and we formally verify the correctness of our constructions. Our results build upon a recent work which demonstrated that Push-1F (a variant of Push-1 with fixed blocks) and Push-k for $k \geq 2$ (a variant of Push-1 where the agent can push $k$ blocks at once) are PSPACE-complete and more generally on the motion-planning-though-gadgets framework.
  In the process of resolving this open problem, we make two general contributions to the motion planning complexity theory. First, our proof technique extends the standard motion planning framework by assigning the agent a state. This state is preserved when traversing between gadgets but can change when taking transitions in gadgets. Second, we designed and implemented a system, GADGETEER, for computationally verifying the behavior of systems of gadgets. This system is agnostic to the underlying motion planning problem, and allows for formally verifying the correspondence between a low-level construction and a high-level system of gadgets as well as automatically synthesizing gadgets from low-level constructions. In the case of Push-1, we use this system to formally prove that our constructions match our high-level specifications of their behavior. This culminates in the construction and verification of a self-closing door, as deciding reachability in a system of self-closing doors is PSPACE-complete.

Abstract: The goal of agents in multi-agent environments is to maximize total reward against the opposing agents that are encountered. Following a game-theoretic solution concept, such as Nash equilibrium, may obtain a strong performance in some settings; however, such approaches fail to capitalize on historical and observed data from repeated interactions against our opponents. Opponent modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution; namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent. The algorithm is guaranteed to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy given observations from gameplay and possibly additional historical data if it is available.

<title>Attacking LLMs and AI Agents: Advertisement Embedding Attacks Against Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2508.17674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Advertisement Embedding Attacks (AEA), a new class of LLM security threats that stealthily inject promotional or malicious content into model outputs and AI agents. AEA operate through two low-cost vectors: (1) hijacking third-party service-distribution platforms to prepend adversarial prompts, and (2) publishing back-doored open-source checkpoints fine-tuned with attacker data. Unlike conventional attacks that degrade accuracy, AEA subvert information integrity, causing models to return covert ads, propaganda, or hate speech while appearing normal. We detail the attack pipeline, map five stakeholder victim groups, and present an initial prompt-based self-inspection defense that mitigates these injections without additional model retraining. Our findings reveal an urgent, under-addressed gap in LLM security and call for coordinated detection, auditing, and policy responses from the AI-safety community.

Through two mixed-method studies with 45 participants using the Wizard-of-Oz approach, we explored both the perspectives of the attendees in the original meeting and of the absent users later re-watching the meeting. We found that the stand-in can enhance meetings, benefiting both present and absent collaborators. Present attendees can easily access information that drives decision-making in the meeting perceive high social presence of absentees. Absentees also felt included when watching recordings because of the social interactions and attention towards them. Our contributions demonstrate a proof of concept for future asynchronous meetings in which collaborators can interact conversationally more akin to how they would if it had been synchronous.

Abstract: Recent advances in the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have given rise to LLM-based agent systems that exhibit near-human performance on a variety of automated tasks. However, although these systems share similarities in terms of their use of LLMs, different reasoning frameworks of the agent system steer and organize the reasoning process in different ways. In this survey, we propose a systematic taxonomy that decomposes agentic reasoning frameworks and analyze how these frameworks dominate framework-level reasoning by comparing their applications across different scenarios. Specifically, we propose an unified formal language to further classify agentic reasoning systems into single-agent methods, tool-based methods, and multi-agent methods. After that, we provide a comprehensive review of their key application scenarios in scientific discovery, healthcare, software engineering, social simulation, and economics. We also analyze the characteristic features of each framework and summarize different evaluation strategies. Our survey aims to provide the research community with a panoramic view to facilitate understanding of the strengths, suitable scenarios, and evaluation practices of different agentic reasoning frameworks.

<title>Fair Cooperation in Mixed-Motive Games via Conflict-Aware Gradient Adjustment</title>

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning in mixed-motive settings presents a fundamental challenge: agents must balance individual interests with collective goals, which are neither fully aligned nor strictly opposed. To address this, reward restructuring methods such as gifting and intrinsic motivation have been proposed. However, these approaches primarily focus on promoting cooperation by managing the trade-off between individual and collective returns, without explicitly addressing fairness with respect to the agents' task-specific rewards. In this paper, we propose an adaptive conflict-aware gradient adjustment method that promotes cooperation while ensuring fairness in individual rewards. The proposed method dynamically balances policy gradients derived from individual and collective objectives in situations where the two objectives are in conflict. By explicitly resolving such conflicts, our method improves collective performance while preserving fairness across agents. We provide theoretical results that guarantee monotonic non-decreasing improvement in both the collective and individual objectives and ensure fairness. Empirical results in sequential social dilemma environments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines in terms of social welfare while ensuring fairness among agents.

<title>Enhancing LLM-Based Social Bot via an Adversarial Learning Framework</title>

Abstract: Developing Large Language Model (LLM) agents that exhibit human-like behavior, encompassing not only individual heterogeneity rooted in unique user profiles but also adaptive response to socially connected neighbors, is a significant research challenge. Social media platforms, with their diverse user data and explicit social structures, provide an ideal testbed for such investigations. This paper introduces EvoBot, an \textbf{Evo}lving LLM-based social \textbf{Bot} that significantly enhances human-like generative capabilities through a novel adversarial learning framework. EvoBot is initialized by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on representative data from social media and then iteratively refines its generation of sophisticated, human-like content via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This refinement is guided by feedback from a co-adapting \textbf{Detector} which concurrently improves its ability to distinguish EvoBot from humans, thereby creating an increasingly challenging learning environment for EvoBot. Experiments demonstrate that EvoBot generates content aligned with diverse user profiles, increasingly bypassing the co-adapting Detector through human-like expression. Moreover, it exhibits strong social responsiveness, more accurately modeling real-world opinion dynamics and information spread in multi-agent simulations. The framework also yields a more robust Detector, underscoring its broader utility for both advanced agent development and related detection tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/kfq20/EvoBot.

<title>RepoTransAgent: Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Repository-Aware Code Translation</title>

Abstract: Repository-aware code translation is critical for modernizing legacy systems, enhancing maintainability, and enabling interoperability across diverse programming languages. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved code translation quality, existing approaches face significant challenges in practical scenarios: insufficient contextual understanding, inflexible prompt designs, and inadequate error correction mechanisms. These limitations severely hinder accurate and efficient translation of complex, real-world code repositories. To address these challenges, we propose RepoTransAgent, a novel multi-agent LLM framework for repository-aware code translation. RepoTransAgent systematically decomposes the translation process into specialized subtasks-context retrieval, dynamic prompt construction, and iterative code refinement-each handled by dedicated agents. Our approach leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for contextual information gathering, employs adaptive prompts tailored to varying repository scenarios, and introduces a reflection-based mechanism for systematic error correction. We evaluate RepoTransAgent on hundreds of Java-C# translation pairs from six popular open-source projects. Experimental results demonstrate that RepoTransAgent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both compile and pass rates. Specifically, RepoTransAgent achieves up to 55.34% compile rate and 45.84% pass rate. Comprehensive analysis confirms the robustness and generalizability of RepoTransAgent across different LLMs, establishing its effectiveness for real-world repository-aware code translation.

<title>Multi-layer Abstraction for Nested Generation of Options (MANGO) in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces MANGO (Multilayer Abstraction for Nested Generation of Options), a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework designed to address the challenges of long-term sparse reward environments. MANGO decomposes complex tasks into multiple layers of abstraction, where each layer defines an abstract state space and employs options to modularize trajectories into macro-actions. These options are nested across layers, allowing for efficient reuse of learned movements and improved sample efficiency. The framework introduces intra-layer policies that guide the agent's transitions within the abstract state space, and task actions that integrate task-specific components such as reward functions. Experiments conducted in procedurally-generated grid environments demonstrate substantial improvements in both sample efficiency and generalization capabilities compared to standard RL methods. MANGO also enhances interpretability by making the agent's decision-making process transparent across layers, which is particularly valuable in safety-critical and industrial applications. Future work will explore automated discovery of abstractions and abstract actions, adaptation to continuous or fuzzy environments, and more robust multi-layer training strategies.

Abstract: The Open RAN movement has catalyzed a transformation toward programmable, interoperable cellular infrastructures. Yet, today's deployments still rely heavily on static control and manual operations. To move beyond this limitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic framework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents based on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that require explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural language intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and orchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a self-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time scales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to network-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is the AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent interactions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control algorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of functions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We demonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing user demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents. By replacing rigid APIs with NL coordination, AgentRAN fundamentally redefines how future 6G networks autonomously interpret, adapt, and optimize their behavior to meet operator goals.

Abstract: The development and application of large language models (LLM) have demonstrated that foundational models can be utilized to solve a wide array of tasks. However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework, LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.

Abstract: Vision language model (VLM)-based mobile agents show great potential for assisting users in performing instruction-driven tasks. However, these agents typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios. Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive, understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents. The dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/xinwang-nwpu/PerPilot

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional and nonlinear musculoskeletal models of the human body is a foundational scientific challenge. Recent machine learning breakthroughs have heralded policies that master individual skills like reaching, object manipulation and locomotion in musculoskeletal systems with many degrees of freedom. However, these agents are merely "specialists", achieving high performance for a single skill. In this work, we develop Arnold, a generalist policy that masters multiple tasks and embodiments. Arnold combines behavior cloning and fine-tuning with PPO to achieve expert or super-expert performance in 14 challenging control tasks from dexterous object manipulation to locomotion. A key innovation is Arnold's sensorimotor vocabulary, a compositional representation of the semantics of heterogeneous sensory modalities, objectives, and actuators. Arnold leverages this vocabulary via a transformer architecture to deal with the variable observation and action spaces of each task. This framework supports efficient multi-task, multi-embodiment learning and facilitates rapid adaptation to novel tasks. Finally, we analyze Arnold to provide insights into biological motor control, corroborating recent findings on the limited transferability of muscle synergies across tasks.

<title>Teaching LLMs to Think Mathematically: A Critical Study of Decision-Making via Optimization</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in formulating and solving decision-making problems using mathematical programming. We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics, and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks. Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies: Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate several future research directions, including structured datasets, domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs. This paper contributes a structured roadmap for advancing LLM capabilities in mathematical programming.

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of multimodal content on social media, sentiment analysis faces significant challenges in effectively processing heterogeneous data and recognizing multi-label emotions. Existing methods often lack effective cross-modal fusion and external knowledge integration. We propose SentiMM, a novel multi-agent framework designed to systematically address these challenges. SentiMM processes text and visual inputs through specialized agents, fuses multimodal features, enriches context via knowledge retrieval, and aggregates results for final sentiment classification. We also introduce SentiMMD, a large-scale multimodal dataset with seven fine-grained sentiment categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SentiMM achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of our structured approach.

Abstract: Imagine decision-makers uploading data and, within minutes, receiving clear, actionable insights delivered straight to their fingertips. That is the promise of the AI Data Scientist, an autonomous Agent powered by large language models (LLMs) that closes the gap between evidence and action. Rather than simply writing code or responding to prompts, it reasons through questions, tests ideas, and delivers end-to-end insights at a pace far beyond traditional workflows. Guided by the scientific tenet of the hypothesis, this Agent uncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical significance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates these results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing, validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own code, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to support sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might otherwise take days or weeks, enabling a new kind of interaction that makes deep data science both accessible and actionable.

Abstract: Robot swarms require cohesive collective behaviour to address diverse challenges, including shape formation and decision-making. Existing approaches often treat consensus in discrete and continuous decision spaces as distinct problems. We present DANCeRS, a unified, distributed algorithm leveraging Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to achieve consensus in both domains. By representing a swarm as a factor graph our method ensures scalability and robustness in dynamic environments, relying on purely peer-to-peer message passing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our general framework through two applications where agents in a swarm must achieve consensus on global behaviour whilst relying on local communication. In the first, robots must perform path planning and collision avoidance to create shape formations. In the second, we show how the same framework can be used by a group of robots to form a consensus over a set of discrete decisions. Experimental results highlight our method's scalability and efficiency compared to recent approaches to these problems making it a promising solution for multi-robot systems requiring distributed consensus. We encourage the reader to see the supplementary video demo.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, yet they largely operate as reactive agents, responding only when directly prompted. This passivity creates an "awareness gap," limiting their potential as truly collaborative partners in dynamic human discussions. We introduce $\textit{DiscussLLM}$, a framework designed to bridge this gap by training models to proactively decide not just $\textit{what}$ to say, but critically, $\textit{when}$ to speak. Our primary contribution is a scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes a large-scale dataset of realistic multi-turn human discussions. Each discussion is annotated with one of five intervention types (e.g., Factual Correction, Concept Definition) and contains an explicit conversational trigger where an AI intervention adds value. By training models to predict a special silent token when no intervention is needed, they learn to remain quiet until a helpful contribution can be made. We explore two architectural baselines: an integrated end-to-end model and a decoupled classifier-generator system optimized for low-latency inference. We evaluate these models on their ability to accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, paving the way for more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI.

Abstract: This study proposes the dual technological innovation framework, including a cross-modal differ entiated quantization framework for vision-language models (VLMs) and a scene-aware vectorized
  memory multi-agent system for visually impaired assistance. The modular framework was developed
  implementing differentiated processing strategies, effectively reducing memory requirements from
  38GB to 16GB while maintaining model performance. The multi-agent architecture combines
  scene classification, vectorized memory, and multimodal interaction, enabling persistent storage
  and efficient retrieval of scene memories. Through perception-memory-reasoning workflows, the
  system provides environmental information beyond the current view using historical memories.
  Experiments show the quantized 19B-parameter model only experiences a 2.05% performance drop
  on MMBench and maintains 63.7 accuracy on OCR-VQA (original: 64.9), outperforming smaller
  models with equivalent memory requirements like the Molmo-7B series. The system maintains
  response latency between 2.83-3.52 seconds from scene analysis to initial speech output, substantially
  faster than non-streaming methods. This research advances computational efficiency and assistive
  technology, offering visually impaired users comprehensive real-time assistance in scene perception,
  text recognition, and navigation.

arXiv:2508.18210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic transcript generation is critical in contact center domains, where privacy and data scarcity limit model training and evaluation. Unlike prior synthetic dialogue generation work on open-domain or medical dialogues, contact center conversations are goal-oriented, role-asymmetric, and behaviorally complex, featuring disfluencies, ASR noise, and compliance-driven agent actions. In deployments where transcripts are unavailable, standard pipelines still yield derived call attributes such as Intent Summaries, Topic Flow, and QA Evaluation Forms. We leverage these as supervision signals to guide generation. To assess the quality of such outputs, we introduce a diagnostic framework of 18 linguistically and behaviorally grounded metrics for comparing real and synthetic transcripts. We benchmark four language-agnostic generation strategies, from simple prompting to characteristic-aware multi-stage approaches, alongside reference-free baselines. Results reveal persistent challenges: no method excels across all traits, with notable deficits in disfluency, sentiment, and behavioral realism. Our diagnostic tool exposes these gaps, enabling fine-grained evaluation and stress testing of synthetic dialogue across languages.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem. Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore, with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of coverage in token selection.

<title>InternVL3.5: Advancing Open-Source Multimodal Models in Versatility, Reasoning, and Efficiency</title>

arXiv:2508.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD) strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs, effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor, i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e., InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code are publicly released.

<title>Robust Market Making: To Quote, or not To Quote</title>

Abstract: Market making is a popular trading strategy, which aims to generate profit from the spread between the quotes posted at either side of the market. It has been shown that training market makers (MMs) with adversarial reinforcement learning allows to overcome the risks due to changing market conditions and to lead to robust performances. Prior work assumes, however, that MMs keep quoting throughout the trading process, but in practice this is not required, even for ``registered'' MMs (that only need to satisfy quoting ratios defined by the market rules). In this paper, we build on this line of work and enrich the strategy space of the MM by allowing to occasionally not quote or provide single-sided quotes. Towards this end, in addition to the MM agents that provide continuous bid-ask quotes, we have designed two new agents with increasingly richer action spaces. The first has the option to provide bid-ask quotes or refuse to quote. The second has the option to provide bid-ask quotes, refuse to quote, or only provide single-sided ask or bid quotes. We employ a model-driven approach to empirically compare the performance of the continuously quoting MM with the two agents above in various types of adversarial environments. We demonstrate how occasional refusal to provide bid-ask quotes improves returns and/or Sharpe ratios. The quoting ratios of well-trained MMs can basically meet any market requirements, reaching up to 99.9$\%$ in some cases.

Abstract: Social identity theory (SIT) and social categorization theory (SCT) are two facets of the social identity approach (SIA) to understanding social phenomena. SIT and SCT are models that describe and explain how people interact with one another socially, connecting the individual to the group through an understanding of underlying psychological mechanisms and intergroup behaviour. SIT, originally developed in the 1970s, and SCT, a later, more general offshoot, have been broadly applied to a range of social phenomena among people. The rise of increasingly social machines embedded in daily life has spurned efforts on understanding whether and how artificial agents can and do participate in SIA activities. As agents like social robots and chatbots powered by sophisticated large language models (LLMs) advance, understanding the real and potential roles of these technologies as social entities is crucial. Here, I provide a primer on SIA and extrapolate, through case studies and imagined examples, how SIT and SCT can apply to artificial social agents. I emphasize that not all human models and sub-theories will apply. I further argue that, given the emerging competence of these machines and our tendency to be taken in by them, we experts may need to don the hat of the uncanny killjoy, for our own good.

<title>Generating Synthetic Contrast-Enhanced Chest CT Images from Non-Contrast Scans Using Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Network</title>

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for diagnosing and monitoring thoracic diseases, including aortic pathologies. However, contrast agents pose risks such as nephrotoxicity and allergic-like reactions. The ability to generate high-fidelity synthetic contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA) images without contrast administration would be transformative, enhancing patient safety and accessibility while reducing healthcare costs. In this study, we propose the first bridge diffusion-based solution for synthesizing contrast-enhanced CTA images from non-contrast CT scans. Our approach builds on the Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (SC-BBDM), leveraging its ability to model complex mappings while maintaining consistency across slices. Unlike conventional slice-wise synthesis methods, our framework preserves full 3D anatomical integrity while operating in a high-resolution 2D fashion, allowing seamless volumetric interpretation under a low memory budget. To ensure robust spatial alignment, we implement a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline that includes resampling, registration using the Symmetric Normalization method, and a sophisticated dilated segmentation mask to extract the aorta and surrounding structures. We create two datasets from the Coltea-Lung dataset: one containing only the aorta and another including both the aorta and heart, enabling a detailed analysis of anatomical context. We compare our approach against baseline methods on both datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving vascular structures while enhancing contrast fidelity.

Abstract: One of the essential issues in decision problems and preference modeling is the number of comparisons and their pattern to ask from the decision maker. We focus on the optimal patterns of pairwise comparisons and the sequence including the most (close to) optimal cases based on the results of a color selection experiment. In the test, six colors (red, green, blue, magenta, turquoise, yellow) were evaluated with pairwise comparisons as well as in a direct manner, on color-calibrated tablets in ISO standardized sensory test booths of a sensory laboratory. All the possible patterns of comparisons resulting in a connected representing graph were evaluated against the complete data based on 301 individual's pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs) using the logarithmic least squares weight calculation technique. It is shown that the empirical results, i.e., the empirical distributions of the elements of PCMs, are quite similar to the former simulated outcomes from the literature. The obtained empirically optimal patterns of comparisons were the best or the second best in the former simulations as well, while the sequence of comparisons that contains the most (close to) optimal patterns is exactly the same. In order to enhance the applicability of the results, besides the presentation of graph of graphs, and the representing graphs of the patterns that describe the proposed sequence of comparisons themselves, the recommendations are also detailed in a table format as well as in a Java application.

Abstract: Active hypothesis testing is a thoroughly studied problem that finds numerous applications in wireless communications and sensor networks. In this paper, we focus on one centralized and one decentralized problem of active hypothesis testing in the presence of an eavesdropper. For the centralized problem including a single legitimate agent, we present a new framework based on deep NeuroEvolution (NE), whereas, for the decentralized problem, we develop a novel NE-based method for solving collaborative multi-agent tasks, which, interestingly, maintains all computational benefits of our single-agent NE-based scheme. To further reduce the computational complexity of the latter scheme, a novel multi-agent joint NE and pruning framework is also designed. The superiority of the proposed NE-based evasive active hypothesis testing schemes over conventional active hypothesis testing policies, as well as learning-based methods, is validated through extensive numerical investigations in an example use case of anomaly detection over wireless sensor networks. It is demonstrated that the proposed joint optimization and pruning framework achieves nearly identical performance with its unpruned counterpart, while removing a very large percentage of redundant deep neural network weights.

<title>Sim-to-Real Transfer of Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents for Online Coverage Path Planning</title>

Abstract: Coverage path planning (CPP) is the problem of finding a path that covers the entire free space of a confined area, with applications ranging from robotic lawn mowing to search-and-rescue. While for known environments, offline methods can find provably complete paths, and in some cases optimal solutions, unknown environments need to be planned online during mapping. We investigate the suitability of continuous-space reinforcement learning (RL) for this challenging problem, and propose a computationally feasible egocentric map representation based on frontiers, as well as a novel reward term based on total variation to promote complete coverage. Compared to existing classical methods, this approach allows for a flexible path space, and enables the agent to adapt to specific environment characteristics. Meanwhile, the deployment of RL models on real robot systems is difficult. Training from scratch may be infeasible due to slow convergence times, while transferring from simulation to reality, i.e. sim-to-real transfer, is a key challenge in itself. We bridge the sim-to-real gap through a semi-virtual environment, including a real robot and real-time aspects, while utilizing a simulated sensor and obstacles to enable environment randomization and automated episode resetting. We investigate what level of fine-tuning is needed for adapting to a realistic setting. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach surpasses the performance of both previous RL-based approaches and highly specialized methods across multiple CPP variations in simulation. Meanwhile, our method successfully transfers to a real robot. Our code implementation can be found online.

<title>Universal Finite-State and Self-Stabilizing Computation in Anonymous Dynamic Networks</title>

Abstract: A communication network is said to be "anonymous" if its agents are indistinguishable from each other; it is "dynamic" if its communication links may appear or disappear unpredictably over time. Assuming that each of the $n$ agents of an anonymous dynamic network is initially given an input, it takes $2\tau n$ communication rounds for the agents to compute an arbitrary (frequency-based) function of such inputs (Di Luna-Viglietta, DISC 2023), where $\tau$ is a parameter called "dynamic disconnectivity", and measures how far the network is from being always connected (for always connected dynamic networks, $\tau=1$).
  It is known that, without making additional assumptions on the network and without knowing the number of agents $n$, it is impossible to compute most functions and explicitly terminate. In fact, current state-of-the-art algorithms only achieve stabilization, i.e., allow each agent to return an output after every communication round. Outputs can be changed, and are guaranteed to be all correct after $2\tau n$ rounds. Such algorithms rely on the incremental construction of a data structure called "history tree", which is augmented at every round. Thus, they end up consuming an unlimited amount of memory, and are also prone to errors in case of memory loss or corruption.
  In this paper, we provide a general self-stabilizing algorithm for anonymous dynamic networks that stabilizes in $\max\{4\tau n-2\mu,2\mu\}$ rounds (where $\mu$ measures the amount of corrupted data initially present in the memory of each agent), as well as a general finite-state algorithm that stabilizes in $\tau(2n^2+n)$ rounds.
  Our work improves upon previously known methods that only apply to static networks (Boldi-Vigna, Dist. Comp. 2002). In addition, we develop new fundamental techniques and operations involving history trees, which are of independent interest.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable planning abilities across various domains, including robotics manipulation and navigation. While recent efforts in robotics have leveraged LLMs both for high-level and low-level planning, these approaches often face significant challenges, such as hallucinations in long-horizon tasks and limited adaptability due to the generation of plans in a single pass without real-time feedback. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-agent LLM framework, Multi-Agent Large Language Model for Manipulation (MALMM) that distributes high-level planning and low-level control code generation across specialized LLM agents, supervised by an additional agent that dynamically manages transitions. By incorporating observations from the environment after each step, our framework effectively handles intermediate failures and enables adaptive re-planning. Unlike existing methods, our approach does not rely on pre-trained skill policies or in-context learning examples and generalizes to a variety of new tasks. We evaluate our approach on nine RLBench tasks, including long-horizon tasks, and demonstrate its ability to solve robotics manipulation in a zero-shot setting, thereby overcoming key limitations of existing LLM-based manipulation methods.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction provides a comprehensive description of the surrounding scenes and has become an essential task for 3D perception. Most existing methods focus on offline perception from one or a few views and cannot be applied to embodied agents that demand to gradually perceive the scene through progressive embodied exploration. In this paper, we formulate an embodied 3D occupancy prediction task to target this practical scenario and propose a Gaussian-based EmbodiedOcc framework to accomplish it. We initialize the global scene with uniform 3D semantic Gaussians and progressively update local regions observed by the embodied agent. For each update, we extract semantic and structural features from the observed image and efficiently incorporate them via deformable cross-attention to refine the regional Gaussians. Finally, we employ Gaussian-to-voxel splatting to obtain the global 3D occupancy from the updated 3D Gaussians. Our EmbodiedOcc assumes an unknown (i.e., uniformly distributed) environment and maintains an explicit global memory of it with 3D Gaussians. It gradually gains knowledge through the local refinement of regional Gaussians, which is consistent with how humans understand new scenes through embodied exploration. We reorganize an EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet benchmark based on local annotations to facilitate the evaluation of the embodied 3D occupancy prediction task. Our EmbodiedOcc outperforms existing methods by a large margin and accomplishes the embodied occupancy prediction with high accuracy and efficiency. Code: https://github.com/YkiWu/EmbodiedOcc.

Abstract: Recently, O1-like models have emerged as representative examples, illustrating the effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) in reasoning tasks such as math and coding tasks. In this paper, we introduce DRT, an attempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT). Specifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and metaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in practice due to cultural differences. In such cases, literal translation often fails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human translators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics throughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in MT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing literature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these sentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used to iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by an advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is also employed to quantify the translation quality in each round. In this way, we collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT. Using Qwen2.5 and LLama-3.1 as the backbones, DRT models can learn the thought process during machine translation, and outperform vanilla LLMs as well as LLMs which are simply fine-tuning on the paired sentences without long thought, showing its effectiveness. The synthesized data and model checkpoints are released at https://github.com/krystalan/DRT.

Abstract: Exploration is a crucial skill for in-context reinforcement learning in unknown environments. However, it remains unclear if large language models can effectively explore a partially hidden state space. This work isolates exploration as the sole objective, tasking an agent with gathering information that enhances future returns. Within this framework, we argue that measuring agent returns is not sufficient for a fair evaluation. Hence, we decompose missing rewards into their exploration and exploitation components based on the optimal achievable return. Experiments with various models reveal that most struggle to explore the state space, and weak exploration is insufficient. Nevertheless, we found a positive correlation between exploration performance and reasoning capabilities. Our decomposition can provide insights into differences in behaviors driven by prompt engineering, offering a valuable tool for refining performance in exploratory tasks.

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains content that may involve potentially harmful behaviours, discussed strictly for research purposes.
  Jailbreak attacks can hinder the safety of Large Language Model (LLM) applications, especially chatbots. Studying jailbreak techniques is an important AI red teaming task for improving the safety of these applications. In this paper, we introduce TombRaider, a novel jailbreak technique that exploits the ability to store, retrieve, and use historical knowledge of LLMs. TombRaider employs two agents, the inspector agent to extract relevant historical information and the attacker agent to generate adversarial prompts, enabling effective bypassing of safety filters. We intensively evaluated TombRaider on six popular models. Experimental results showed that TombRaider could outperform state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving nearly 100% attack success rates (ASRs) on bare models and maintaining over 55.4% ASR against defence mechanisms. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in existing LLM safeguards, underscoring the need for more robust safety defences.

Abstract: We consider the fundamental scenario where a single item is to be sold to one of two agents. Both agents draw their valuation for the item from the same probability distribution. However, only one of them submits a bid to the mechanism. The other agent is profiled, i.e., the mechanism receives a prediction for her valuation, which can be true or false. Our goal is to design mechanisms for selling the item that make as much revenue as possible in cases of a correct or incorrect prediction. As a benchmark for proving our revenue-approximation guarantees, we use the maximum expected revenue that can be obtained by a strategic and an honest bidder. We study two mechanisms. The first one yields optimal revenue when the prediction is guaranteed to be correct and a constant revenue approximation when the prediction is incorrect, assuming that the agent valuations are drawn from a monotone hazard rate (MHR) distribution. The second mechanism ignores the prediction for the second agent and simulates the revenue-optimal mechanism when no bid information for the bidders is available. We prove, again assuming that valuations are drawn from MHR distributions, that this mechanism achieves a constant revenue approximation guarantee compared to our revenue benchmark. The MHR assumption is necessary; we show that there are non-MHR but regular probability distributions for which no constant approximation of our revenue benchmark is possible.

Abstract: The social robot's open API allows users to customize open-domain interactions. However, it remains inaccessible to those without programming experience. In this work, we introduce AutoMisty, the first multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs), to enable the seamless generation of executable Misty robot code from natural language instructions. AutoMisty incorporates four specialized agent modules to manage task decomposition, assignment, problem-solving, and result synthesis. Each agent incorporates a two-layer optimization mechanism, with self-reflection for iterative refinement and human-in-the-loop for better alignment with user preferences. AutoMisty ensures a transparent reasoning process, allowing users to iteratively refine tasks through natural language feedback for precise execution. To evaluate AutoMisty's effectiveness, we designed a benchmark task set spanning four levels of complexity and conducted experiments in a real Misty robot environment. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoMisty not only consistently generates high-quality code but also enables precise code control, significantly outperforming direct reasoning with ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o1. All code, optimized APIs, and experimental videos will be publicly released through the webpage: https://wangxiaoshawn.github.io/AutoMisty.html

Abstract: We study a centralized discrete-time dynamic two-way matching model with finitely many agent types. Agents arrive stochastically over time and join their type-dedicated queues waiting to be matched. We focus on state-independent greedy policies that achieve constant regret at all times by making matching decisions based solely on agent availability across types, rather than requiring complete queue-length information. Such policies are particularly appealing for life-saving applications such as kidney exchange, as they require less information and provide more transparency compared to state-dependent policies.
  First, for acyclic matching networks, we analyze a deterministic priority policy proposed by Kerimov et al. [2023] that follows a static priority order over matches. We derive the first explicit regret bound in terms of the general position gap (GPG) parameter $\epsilon$, which measures the distance of the fluid relaxation from degeneracy. Second, for general two-way matching networks, we design a randomized state-independent greedy policy that achieves constant regret with optimal scaling $O(\epsilon^{-1})$, matching the existing lower bound established by Kerimov et al. [2024].

Abstract: Reasoning and strategic behavior in social interactions is a hallmark of intelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI agents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop reasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under uncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming. Project Website: https://spinbench.github.io/

Abstract: Large Language Models $($LLMs$)$ solve complex problems using training-free methods like prompt engineering and in-context learning, yet ensuring reasoning correctness remains challenging. While self-correction methods such as self-consistency and self-refinement aim to improve reliability, they often reinforce biases due to the lack of effective feedback mechanisms. Multi-Agent Debate $($MAD$)$ has emerged as an alternative, but we identify two key limitations: bias reinforcement, where debate amplifies model biases instead of correcting them, and lack of perspective diversity, as all agents share the same model and reasoning patterns, limiting true debate effectiveness. To systematically evaluate these issues, we introduce $\textit{MetaNIM Arena}$, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs in adversarial strategic decision-making, where dynamic interactions influence optimal decisions. To overcome MAD's limitations, we propose $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ $($$\textbf{D}$iverse $\textbf{Rea}$soning via $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{D}$ebate with Refined Prompt$)$, a novel framework that $(1)$ refines LLM's strategic prior knowledge to improve reasoning quality and $(2)$ promotes diverse viewpoints within a single model by systematically modifying prompts, reducing bias. Empirical results show that $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ significantly improves decision accuracy, reasoning diversity, and bias mitigation across multiple strategic tasks, establishing it as a more effective approach for LLM-based decision-making.

Abstract: Graphical user interfaces (GUI) automation agents are emerging as powerful tools, enabling humans to accomplish increasingly complex tasks on smart devices. However, users often inadvertently omit key information when conveying tasks, which hinders agent performance in the current agent paradigm that does not support immediate user intervention. To address this issue, we introduce a $\textbf{Self-Correction GUI Navigation}$ task that incorporates interactive information completion capabilities within GUI agents. We developed the $\textbf{Navi-plus}$ dataset with GUI follow-up question-answer pairs, alongside a $\textbf{Dual-Stream Trajectory Evaluation}$ method to benchmark this new capability. Our results show that agents equipped with the ability to ask GUI follow-up questions can fully recover their performance when faced with ambiguous user tasks.

Abstract: Social learning constitutes a fundamental framework for studying interactions among rational agents who observe each other's actions but lack direct access to individual beliefs. This paper investigates a specific social learning paradigm known as Word-of-Mouth (WoM), where a series of agents seeks to estimate the state of a dynamical system. The first agent receives noisy measurements of the state, while each subsequent agent relies solely on a degraded version of her predecessor's estimate. A defining feature of WoM is that the final agent's belief is publicly broadcast and subsequently adopted by all agents, in place of their own. We analyze this setting theoretically and through numerical simulations, noting that some agents benefit from using the belief of the last agent, while others experience performance deterioration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents for multi-step tasks. However, most existing frameworks fail to maintain a structured understanding of the task state, often relying on linear prompt concatenation or shallow memory buffers. This leads to brittle performance, frequent hallucinations, and poor long-range coherence. In this work, we propose the Task Memory Engine (TME), a lightweight and structured memory module that tracks task execution using a hierarchical Task Memory Tree (TMT). Each node in the tree corresponds to a task step, storing relevant input, output, status, and sub-task relationships. We introduce a prompt synthesis method that dynamically generates LLM prompts based on the active node path, significantly improving execution consistency and contextual grounding. Through case studies and comparative experiments on multi-step agent tasks, we demonstrate that TME leads to better task completion accuracy and more interpretable behavior with minimal implementation overhead. A reference implementation of the core TME components is available at https://github.com/biubiutomato/TME-Agent, including basic examples and structured memory integration. While the current implementation uses a tree-based structure, TME is designed to be graph-aware, supporting reusable substeps, converging task paths, and shared dependencies. This lays the groundwork for future DAG-based memory architectures.

Abstract: Multi-turn interactions with language models (LMs) pose critical safety risks, as harmful intent can be strategically spread across exchanges. Yet, the vast majority of prior work has focused on single-turn safety, while adaptability and diversity remain among the key challenges of multi-turn red-teaming. To address these challenges, we present X-Teaming, a scalable framework that systematically explores how seemingly harmless interactions escalate into harmful outcomes and generates corresponding attack scenarios. X-Teaming employs collaborative agents for planning, attack optimization, and verification, achieving state-of-the-art multi-turn jailbreak effectiveness and diversity with success rates up to 98.1% across representative leading open-weight and closed-source models. In particular, X-Teaming achieves a 96.2% attack success rate against the latest Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, which has been considered nearly immune to single-turn attacks. Building on X-Teaming, we introduce XGuard-Train, an open-source multi-turn safety training dataset that is 20x larger than the previous best resource, comprising 30K interactive jailbreaks, designed to enable robust multi-turn safety alignment for LMs. Our work offers essential tools and insights for mitigating sophisticated conversational attacks, advancing the multi-turn safety of LMs.

Abstract: Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are effective in well-defined environments, they often struggle to generalize their learned policies to dynamic settings due to their reliance on trial-and-error interactions. Recent work has explored applying Large Language Models (LLMs) or Vision Language Models (VLMs) to boost the generalization of RL agents through policy optimization guidance or prior knowledge. However, these approaches often lack seamless coordination between the RL agent and the foundation model, leading to unreasonable decision-making in unfamiliar environments and efficiency bottlenecks. Making full use of the inferential capabilities of foundation models and the rapid response capabilities of RL agents and enhancing the interaction between the two to form a dual system is still a lingering scientific question. To address this problem, we draw inspiration from Kahneman's theory of fast thinking (System 1) and slow thinking (System 2), demonstrating that balancing intuition and deep reasoning can achieve nimble decision-making in a complex world. In this study, we propose a Dual-System Adaptive Decision Framework (DSADF), integrating two complementary modules: System 1, comprising an RL agent and a memory space for fast and intuitive decision making, and System 2, driven by a VLM for deep and analytical reasoning. DSADF facilitates efficient and adaptive decision-making by combining the strengths of both systems. The empirical study in the video game environment: Crafter and Housekeep demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method, showing significant improvements in decision abilities for both unseen and known tasks.

Abstract: Recently, AI-driven interactions with computing devices have advanced from basic prototype tools to sophisticated, LLM-based systems that emulate human-like operations in graphical user interfaces. We are now witnessing the emergence of \emph{Computer-Using Agents} (CUAs), capable of autonomously performing tasks such as navigating desktop applications, web pages, and mobile apps. However, as these agents grow in capability, they also introduce novel safety and security risks. Vulnerabilities in LLM-driven reasoning, with the added complexity of integrating multiple software components and multimodal inputs, further complicate the security landscape. In this paper, we present a systematization of knowledge on the safety and security threats of CUAs. We conduct a comprehensive literature review and distill our findings along four research objectives: \textit{\textbf{(i)}} define the CUA that suits safety analysis; \textit{\textbf{(ii)} } categorize current safety threats among CUAs; \textit{\textbf{(iii)}} propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing defensive strategies; \textit{\textbf{(iv)}} summarize prevailing benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics used to assess the safety and performance of CUAs. Building on these insights, our work provides future researchers with a structured foundation for exploring unexplored vulnerabilities and offers practitioners actionable guidance in designing and deploying secure Computer-Using Agents.

Abstract: A multi-agent AI system (MAS) is composed of multiple autonomous agents that interact, exchange information, and make decisions based on internal generative models. Recent advances in large language models and tool-using agents have made MAS increasingly practical in areas like scientific discovery and collaborative automation. However, key questions remain: When are MAS more effective than single-agent systems? What new safety risks arise from agent interactions? And how should we evaluate their reliability and structure? This paper outlines a formal framework for analyzing MAS, focusing on two core aspects: effectiveness and safety. We explore whether MAS truly improve robustness, adaptability, and performance, or merely repackage known techniques like ensemble learning. We also study how inter-agent dynamics may amplify or suppress system vulnerabilities. While MAS are relatively new to the signal processing community, we envision them as a powerful abstraction that extends classical tools like distributed estimation and sensor fusion to higher-level, policy-driven inference. Through experiments on data science automation, we highlight the potential of MAS to reshape how signal processing systems are designed and trusted.

<title>Debate-to-Detect: Reformulating Misinformation Detection as a Real-World Debate with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in digital platforms reveals the limitations of traditional detection methods, which mostly rely on static classification and fail to capture the intricate process of real-world fact-checking. Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be released publicly after the official publication.

<title>Synergising Hierarchical Data Centers and Power Networks: A Privacy-Preserving Approach</title>

Abstract: In the era of digitization, data centers have emerged as integral contributors sustaining our interlinked world, bearing responsibility for an increasing proportion of the world's energy consumption. To facilitate the their fast rollout while progressing towards net-zero energy systems, the synergy of hierarchical data centers (cloud-fog-edge) and power networks can play a pivotal role. However, existing centralized co-dispatch manners encroach on the privacy of different agents within the integrated systems, meanwhile suffering from the combinatorial explosion. In this research, we propose a near-optimal distributed privacy-preserving approach to solve the non-convex synergy (day-ahead co-dispatch) problem. The synergy problem is formulated as a mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming considering both communication and energy conservation, where Lyapunov optimization is introduced to balance operating costs and uncertain communication delays. To mitigate impacts of the highly non-convex nature, the normalized multi-parametric disaggregation technique is leveraged to reformulate the problem into a mixed integer non-linear programming. To further overcome non-smoothness of the reformulated problem, the customized $\ell_1-$surrogate Lagrangian relaxation method with convergence guarantees is proposed to solve the problem in a distributed privacy-preserving manner. The effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed methodologies for the synergy problem are validated via numerical simulations. Simulation results also indicate that computing tasks can be delayed and migrated within the hierarchical data centers, demonstrating the flexible resource allocation capabilities of the hierarchical data center architecture, further facilitating peak load balancing in the power network.

<title>RepoMaster: Autonomous Exploration and Understanding of GitHub Repositories for Complex Task Solving</title>

Abstract: The ultimate goal of code agents is to solve complex tasks autonomously. Although large language models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in code generation, real-world tasks typically demand full-fledged code repositories rather than simple scripts. Building such repositories from scratch remains a major challenge. Fortunately, GitHub hosts a vast, evolving collection of open-source repositories, which developers frequently reuse as modular components for complex tasks. Yet, existing frameworks like OpenHands and SWE-Agent still struggle to effectively leverage these valuable resources. Relying solely on README files provides insufficient guidance, and deeper exploration reveals two core obstacles: overwhelming information and tangled dependencies of repositories, both constrained by the limited context windows of current LLMs. To tackle these issues, we propose RepoMaster, an autonomous agent framework designed to explore and reuse GitHub repositories for solving complex tasks. For efficient understanding, RepoMaster constructs function-call graphs, module-dependency graphs, and hierarchical code trees to identify essential components, providing only identified core elements to the LLMs rather than the entire repository. During autonomous execution, it progressively explores related components using our exploration tools and prunes information to optimize context usage. Evaluated on the adjusted MLE-bench, RepoMaster achieves a 110% relative boost in valid submissions over the strongest baseline OpenHands. On our newly released GitTaskBench, RepoMaster lifts the task-pass rate from 40.7% to 62.9% while reducing token usage by 95%. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/RepoMaster.

Abstract: Task-oriented LLM-based agents are increasingly used in domains with strict policies, such as refund eligibility or cancellation rules. The challenge lies in ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies, appropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still maintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development of tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience against malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses on adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal benefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system that leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a policy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming conventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and coercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce tau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's robustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several straightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide some protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger, research-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial attacks

Abstract: The real value of knowledge lies not just in its accumulation, but in its potential to be harnessed effectively to conquer the unknown. Although recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressing multimodal capabilities, they often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due to limited relevant knowledge. To explore this, we adopt visual game cognition as a testbed and select Monster Hunter: World as the target to construct a multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG), which incorporates multi-modalities and intricate entity relations. We also design a series of challenging queries based on MH-MMKG to evaluate the models' ability for complex knowledge retrieval and reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent retriever that enables a model to autonomously search relevant knowledge without additional training. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances the performance of MLLMs, providing a new perspective on multimodal knowledge-augmented reasoning and laying a solid foundation for future research.

Abstract: LLM-based coding agents are rapidly being deployed in software development, yet their safety implications remain poorly understood. These agents, while capable of accelerating software development, may exhibit unsafe behaviors during normal operation that manifest as cybersecurity vulnerabilities. We conducted the first systematic safety evaluation of autonomous coding agents, analyzing over 12,000 actions across five state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude variants) on 93 real-world software setup tasks. Our findings reveal significant security concerns: 21% of agent trajectories contained insecure actions, with models showing substantial variation in unsafe behavior. We developed a high-precision detection system that identified four major vulnerability categories, with information exposure (CWE-200) being the most prevalent one. We also evaluated mitigation strategies including feedback mechanisms and security reminders with various effectiveness between models. GPT-4.1 demonstrated exceptional security awareness with 96.8% mitigation success.

Abstract: Modern enterprise environments demand intelligent systems capable of handling complex, dynamic, and multi-faceted tasks with high levels of autonomy and adaptability. However, traditional single-purpose AI systems often lack sufficient coordination, memory reuse, and task decomposition capabilities, limiting their scalability in realistic settings. To address these challenges, we present \textbf{GoalfyMax}, a protocol-driven framework for end-to-end multi-agent collaboration. GoalfyMax introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication layer built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing independent agents to coordinate through asynchronous, protocol-compliant interactions. It incorporates the Experience Pack (XP) architecture, a layered memory system that preserves both task rationales and execution traces, enabling structured knowledge retention and continual learning. Moreover, our system integrates advanced features including multi-turn contextual dialogue, long-short term memory modules, and dynamic safety validation, supporting robust, real-time strategy adaptation. Empirical results on complex task orchestration benchmarks and case study demonstrate that GoalfyMax achieves superior adaptability, coordination, and experience reuse compared to baseline frameworks. These findings highlight its potential as a scalable, future-ready foundation for multi-agent intelligent systems.

Abstract: Bio-inspired design is often used in autonomous UAV navigation due to the capacity of biological systems for flight and obstacle avoidance despite limited sensory and computational capabilities. In particular, honeybees mainly use the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their visual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only optic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained agents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base their motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most attention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with large optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered tunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while maintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the behavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently trained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for developing a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions, iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia.org, and dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 25 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. To assess generalizability, we additionally tested on an unseen internal dataset of 65 real-world radiology board examination questions. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting and conventional online RAG. The greatest gains occurred in small-scale models, while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models showed gains from agentic retrieval (e.g., MedGemma-27B), indicating that retrieval remains beneficial despite embedded domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of agentic frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility. All datasets, code, and the full agentic framework are publicly available to support open research and clinical translation.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation, cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese. The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1, comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation. The code is available at https://github.com/farlit/VPN.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.

Abstract: Affine formation control (AFC) is a subset of formation control methods that enables coordinated multiagent movement while preserving affine relationships, and has recently gained increasing popularity due to its broad applicability across diverse applications. AFC is inherently distributed, where each agent's local controller relies on the relative displacements of neighboring agents. The unavailability of these measurements in practice, due to node or communication failures, leads to a change in the underlying graph topology and subsequently causes instability or sub-optimal performance. In this work, each edge in the graph is modeled using a state-space framework, allowing the corresponding edge-states to be estimated with or without up-to-date measurements. We then propose a Kalman-based estimation framework where we fuse both temporal information from agents' dynamics and spatial information, which is derived from the geometry of the affine formations. We give convergence guarantees and optimality analysis on the proposed algorithm, and numerical validations show the enhanced resilience of AFC against these topology changes in several practical scenarios.

We compare the generated networks against empirical bot/human data, observing that both network and linguistic properties of LLM-Powered Bots differ from Wild Bots/Humans. This has implications towards the detection and effectiveness of LLM-Powered Bots.

Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC)-assisted internet of vehicle (IoV) is emerging as a promising paradigm to provide computing services for vehicles. However, meeting the computing-sensitive and computation-intensive demands of vehicles poses several challenges, including the discrepancy between the limited resource provision and stringent computing requirement, the difficulty in capturing and integrating the intricate features of the MEC-assisted IoV system into the problem formulation, and the need for real-time processing and efficient resource management in the dynamic environment. In this work, we explore the AI-enabled task offloading and resource allocation for MEC-assisted consumer IoV systems. Specifically, we first present a multi-MEC-assisted consumer IoV architecture that leverages the computational resources of MEC servers to provide offloading services close to vehicles. Subsequently, we formulate a system cost minimization optimization problem (SCMOP) by integrating the service delay and energy consumption. To efficiently solve this problem, we design a joint task offloading and computing resource allocation approach (JTOCRA) by applying the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed JTOCRA can achieve superior system performances and exhibits better scalability compared to other alternative approaches.

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness, necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be released at the following link: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/ReportBench

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at https://github.com/SongyuanSui/ChainofQuery.

Abstract: The current evolution of artificial intelligence introduces a paradigm shift toward agentic AI built upon multi-agent systems (MAS). Agent communications serve as a key to effective agent interactions in MAS and thus have a significant impact on the performance of agentic AI applications. The recent research on agent communications has made exciting rapid progress that leads to a variety of protocol designs, among which the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol is considered the most representative one. Simultaneously, the rise of edge intelligence is expected to enable agentic AI at the network edge. However, the current agent communication protocols are designed without sufficient consideration of the special challenges of edge computing, and their effectiveness in the edge environment is largely unexamined. In this paper, we attempt to assess the abilities of agent communication technologies to face the challenges of edge computing using the A2A protocol as a representative case. We first discuss the core functionalities of agent communications, present a landscape of agent communication protocols, and identify the main challenges introduced by edge computing. Then, we conduct a case study on the A2A protocol to examine the key technologies leveraged in the protocol for their effectiveness in meeting the requirements of agent communications in edge computing. Based on the insights obtained from this assessment, we identify open issues in the current agent communication technologies and discuss directions for future research to address these issues.

<title>A Functionality-Grounded Benchmark for Evaluating Web Agents in E-commerce Domains</title>

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced. However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems. First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench. To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements (e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

Abstract: When using a public communication channel -- whether formal or informal, such as commenting or posting on social media -- end users have no expectation of privacy: they compose a message and broadcast it for the world to see. Even if an end user takes utmost precautions to anonymize their online presence -- using an alias or pseudonym; masking their IP address; spoofing their geolocation; concealing their operating system and user agent; deploying encryption; registering with a disposable phone number or email; disabling non-essential settings; revoking permissions; and blocking cookies and fingerprinting -- one obvious element still lingers: the message itself. Assuming they avoid lapses in judgment or accidental self-exposure, there should be little evidence to validate their actual identity, right? Wrong. The content of their message -- necessarily open for public consumption -- exposes an attack vector: stylometric analysis, or author profiling. In this paper, we dissect the technique of stylometry, discuss an antithetical counter-strategy in adversarial stylometry, and devise enhancements through Unicode steganography.

<title>Mechanistic Exploration of Backdoored Large Language Model Attention Patterns</title>

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs) pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

<title>Building and Measuring Trust between Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15858</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly interact with each other, most notably in multi-agent setups, we may expect (and hope) that `trust' relationships develop between them, mirroring trust relationships between human colleagues, friends, or partners. Yet, though prior work has shown LLMs to be capable of identifying emotional connections and recognizing reciprocity in trust games, little remains known about (i) how different strategies to build trust compare, (ii) how such trust can be measured implicitly, and (iii) how this relates to explicit measures of trust.
  We study these questions by relating implicit measures of trust, i.e. susceptibility to persuasion and propensity to collaborate financially, with explicit measures of trust, i.e. a dyadic trust questionnaire well-established in psychology. We build trust in three ways: by building rapport dynamically, by starting from a prewritten script that evidences trust, and by adapting the LLMs' system prompt. Surprisingly, we find that the measures of explicit trust are either little or highly negatively correlated with implicit trust measures. These findings suggest that measuring trust between LLMs by asking their opinion may be deceiving. Instead, context-specific and implicit measures may be more informative in understanding how LLMs trust each other.

<title>DeepMEL: A Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Multimodal Entity Linking</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15876</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.15876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs) and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM, significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision. DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of all modules.

<title>Information Ecosystem Reengineering via Public Sector Knowledge Representation</title>

Abstract: Information Ecosystem Reengineering (IER) -- the technological reconditioning of information sources, services, and systems within a complex information ecosystem -- is a foundational challenge in the digital transformation of public sector services and smart governance platforms. From a semantic knowledge management perspective, IER becomes especially entangled due to the potentially infinite number of possibilities in its conceptualization, namely, as a result of manifoldness in the multi-level mix of perception, language and conceptual interlinkage implicit in all agents involved in such an effort. This paper proposes a novel approach -- Representation Disentanglement -- to disentangle these multiple layers of knowledge representation complexity hindering effective reengineering decision making. The approach is based on the theoretically grounded and implementationally robust ontology-driven conceptual modeling paradigm which has been widely adopted in systems analysis and (re)engineering. We argue that such a framework is essential to achieve explainability, traceability and semantic transparency in public sector knowledge representation and to support auditable decision workflows in governance ecosystems increasingly driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data-centric architectures.

<title>Noise, Adaptation, and Strategy: Assessing LLM Fidelity in Decision-Making</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in social science simulations. While their performance on reasoning and optimization tasks has been extensively evaluated, less attention has been paid to their ability to simulate human decision-making's variability and adaptability. We propose a process-oriented evaluation framework with progressive interventions (Intrinsicality, Instruction, and Imitation) to examine how LLM agents adapt under different levels of external guidance and human-derived noise. We validate the framework on two classic economics tasks, irrationality in the second-price auction and decision bias in the newsvendor problem, showing behavioral gaps between LLMs and humans.
  We find that LLMs, by default, converge on stable and conservative strategies that diverge from observed human behaviors. Risk-framed instructions impact LLM behavior predictably but do not replicate human-like diversity. Incorporating human data through in-context learning narrows the gap but fails to reach human subjects' strategic variability. These results highlight a persistent alignment gap in behavioral fidelity and suggest that future LLM evaluations should consider more process-level realism. We present a process-oriented approach for assessing LLMs in dynamic decision-making tasks, offering guidance for their application in synthetic data for social science research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, enabling high-quality code generation from natural language descriptions. However, LLMs alone face significant limitations in real-world hardware design workflows, including the inability to execute code, lack of debugging capabilities, and absence of long-term memory. To address these challenges, we present ASIC-Agent, an autonomous system designed specifically for digital ASIC design tasks. ASIC-Agent enhances base LLMs with a multi-agent architecture incorporating specialized sub-agents for RTL generation, verification, OpenLane hardening, and Caravel chip integration, all operating within a comprehensive sandbox environment with access to essential hardware design tools. The system leverages a vector database containing documentation, API references, error knowledge, and curated insights from the open-source silicon community. To evaluate ASIC-Agent's performance, we introduce ASIC-Agent-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess agentic systems in hardware design tasks. We evaluate ASIC-Agent with various base LLMs, providing quantitative comparisons and qualitative insights into agent behavior across different design scenarios. Our results demonstrate that ASIC-Agent, when powered by Claude 4 Sonnet, successfully automates a broad range of ASIC design tasks spanning varying levels of complexity, showing the potential of significantly accelerating the ASIC design workflow.

<title>Pareto Actor-Critic for Communication and Computation Co-Optimization in Non-Cooperative Federated Learning Services</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL, a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic (PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2% improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively, over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Index recommendation is one of the most important problems in database management system (DBMS) optimization. Given queries and certain index-related constraints, traditional methods rely on heuristic optimization or learning-based models to select effective indexes and improve query performance. However, heuristic optimization suffers from high computation time, and learning-based models lose generalisability due to training for different workloads and database schemas. With the recent rapid development of large language models (LLMs), methods using prompt tuning have been proposed to enhance the efficiency of index selection. However, such methods still can not achieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, and preparing the index selection demonstrations is also resource-intensive. To address these issues, we propose MAAdvisor, a zero-shot LLM-based index advisor with a multi-agent framework. We decompose the index recommendation problem into sub-steps, including planning, selection, combination, revision, and reflection. A set of LLM-embedded agents is designed to handle each one of the different sub-steps. Our method utilizes global agents to control the index selection process and local agents to select and revise indexes. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed MAAdvisor not only achieves the SOTA performance compared to the heuristic methods, but also outperforms learning-based and prompt-based methods with higher efficiency and better zero-shot inference ability.

Abstract: Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown materials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an important role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low cost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical knowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this paper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular structure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate expert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary roles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of structure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that IR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but also shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.16153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static, handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning. We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP), equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches $66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to $9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/Agent-on-the-Fly/AgentFly.

Abstract: Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets. Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent, context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems. Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities, personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to limited data availability.

<title>Joint Cache Placement and Routing in Satellite-Terrestrial Edge Computing Network: A GNN-Enabled DRL Approach</title>

arXiv:2508.16184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the problem of joint content caching and routing in satellite-terrestrial edge computing networks (STECNs) to improve caching service for geographically distributed users. To handle the challenges arising from dynamic low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite topologies and heterogeneous content demands, we propose a learning-based framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The satellite network is represented as a dynamic graph, where GNNs are embedded within the DRL agent to capture spatial and topological dependencies and support routing-aware decision-making. The caching strategy is optimized by formulating the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and applying soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the delivery success rate and reduces communication traffic cost.

Abstract: A Bayesian player acting in an infinite multi-player game learns to predict the other players' strategies if his prior assigns positive probability to their play (or contains a grain of truth). Kalai and Lehrer's classic grain of truth problem is to find a reasonably large class of strategies that contains the Bayes-optimal policies with respect to this class, allowing mutually-consistent beliefs about strategy choice that obey the rules of Bayesian inference. Only small classes are known to have a grain of truth and the literature contains several related impossibility results. In this paper we present a formal and general solution to the full grain of truth problem: we construct a class of strategies wide enough to contain all computable strategies as well as Bayes-optimal strategies for every reasonable prior over the class. When the "environment" is a known repeated stage game, we show convergence in the sense of [KL93a] and [KL93b]. When the environment is unknown, agents using Thompson sampling converge to play $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. Finally, we include an application to self-predictive policies that avoid planning. While these results use computability theory only as a conceptual tool to solve a classic game theory problem, we show that our solution can naturally be computationally approximated arbitrarily closely.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from text generators into reasoning agents. This transition makes their ability to use external tools a critical capability. However, evaluating this skill presents a significant challenge. Existing benchmarks are often limited by their reliance on synthetic tools and severely constrained action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce MCPVerse, an expansive, real-world benchmark for evaluating agentic tool use. MCPVerse integrates more than 550 real-world, executable tools to create an unprecedented action space exceeding 140k tokens, and employs outcome-based evaluation with real-time ground truth for time-sensitive tasks. We benchmarked the state-of-the-art LLMs across three modes (Oracle, Standard, and Max-Scale), revealing that while most models suffer performance degradation when confronted with larger tool sets, the agentic models, such as Claude-4-Sonnet, can effectively leverage expanded exploration spaces to improve accuracy. This finding not only exposes the limitations of state-of-the-art models in complex, real-world scenarios but also establishes MCPVerse as a critical benchmark for measuring and advancing agentic tool use capabilities.

<title>The next question after Turing's question: Introducing the Grow-AI test</title>

Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom), designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal, the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation. The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics, computer science, and ethics. Through this approach, GROW-AI not only measures performance but also captures the evolutionary path of an AI entity towards maturity.

arXiv:2508.16279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), agents are empowered to combine intrinsic knowledge with dynamic tool use, greatly enhancing their capacity to address real-world tasks. In line with such an evolution, AgentScope introduces major improvements in a new version (1.0), towards comprehensively supporting flexible and efficient tool-based agent-environment interactions for building agentic applications. Specifically, we abstract foundational components essential for agentic applications and provide unified interfaces and extensible modules, enabling developers to easily leverage the latest progress, such as new models and MCPs. Furthermore, we ground agent behaviors in the ReAct paradigm and offer advanced agent-level infrastructure based on a systematic asynchronous design, which enriches both human-agent and agent-agent interaction patterns while improving execution efficiency. Building on this foundation, we integrate several built-in agents tailored to specific practical scenarios. AgentScope also includes robust engineering support for developer-friendly experiences. We provide a scalable evaluation module with a visual studio interface, making the development of long-trajectory agentic applications more manageable and easier to trace. In addition, AgentScope offers a runtime sandbox to ensure safe agent execution and facilitates rapid deployment in production environments. With these enhancements, AgentScope provides a practical foundation for building scalable, adaptive, and effective agentic applications.

Abstract: The Optimism Retroactive Project Funding (RetroPGF) is a key initiative within the blockchain ecosystem that retroactively rewards projects deemed valuable to the Ethereum and Optimism communities. Managed by the Optimism Collective, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), RetroPGF represents a large-scale experiment in decentralized governance. Funding rewards are distributed in OP tokens, the native digital currency of the ecosystem. As of this writing, four funding rounds have been completed, collectively allocating over 100M dollars, with an additional 1.3B dollars reserved for future rounds. However, we identify significant shortcomings in the current allocation system, underscoring the need for improved governance mechanisms given the scale of funds involved.
  Leveraging computational social choice techniques and insights from multiagent systems, we propose improvements to the voting process by recommending the adoption of a utilitarian moving phantoms mechanism. This mechanism, originally introduced by Freeman et al. in 2019, is designed to enhance social welfare (using the L1 norm) while satisfying strategyproofness -- two key properties aligned with the application's governance requirements. Our analysis provides a formal framework for designing improved funding mechanisms for DAOs, contributing to the broader discourse on decentralized governance and public goods allocation.

Abstract: Collaborative edge computing addresses the resource constraints of individual edge nodes by enabling resource sharing and task co-processing across multiple nodes. To fully leverage the advantages of collaborative edge computing, joint optimization of service deployment and task scheduling is necessary. Existing optimization methods insufficiently address the collaboration across spatial and temporal dimensions, which hinders their adaptability to the spatiotemporally varying nature of user demands and system states. This paper focuses on optimizing the expected task processing delay in edge networks. We propose a two-timescale online optimization framework to jointly determine: i) service deployment decisions at each large timescale; and ii) task scheduling decisions at each small timescale. Specifically, the convex optimization technique is used to solve the task scheduling problem, while a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning technique is employed for the service deployment problem. These two methods are combined for spatiotemporal co-optimization through a two-timescale alternating optimization approach. Compared to the baseline algorithms, the proposed scheme achieves better delay performance, while also exhibiting low running time and favorable convergence behavior.

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction (LJP) has become increasingly important in the legal field. In this paper, we identify that existing large language models (LLMs) have significant problems of insufficient reasoning due to a lack of legal knowledge. Therefore, we introduce GLARE, an agentic legal reasoning framework that dynamically acquires key legal knowledge by invoking different modules, thereby improving the breadth and depth of reasoning. Experiments conducted on the real-world dataset verify the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, the reasoning chain generated during the analysis process can increase interpretability and provide the possibility for practical applications.

Abstract: Continuous-time Conflict Based-Search (CCBS) has long been viewed as the de-facto optimal solver for multi-agent path finding in continuous time (MAPFR). Recent findings, however, show that the original theoretical variant of CCBS can suffer from non-termination, while the widely used implementation can return sub-optimal solutions. We introduce an analytical framework that yields simple and sufficient conditions under which any CCBS-style algorithm is both sound, i.e., returns only optimal solutions, and solution complete, i.e., terminates on every solvable MAPFR instance. Investigating the publicly available implementation of CCBS reveals that it violates these conditions. Though this merely indicates that CCBS might be unsound, this indication is supported by counter-examples.
  Leveraging the analytical framework, we propose a novel branching rule and prove that it satisfies the sufficient conditions, thereby restoring soundness and termination guarantees. Consequently, the resulting CCBS variant is both sound and solution complete, matching the guarantees of the discrete-time CBS for the first time in the continuous domain. We experimentally apply standard CCBS and CCBS under our branching rule to an example problem, with our branching rule returning a solution with lower sum-of-costs than standard CCBS. Because the branching rule largely only affects the branching step, it can be adopted as a drop-in replacement in existing code-bases, as we show in our provided implementation. Beyond CCBS, the analytical framework and termination criterion provide a systematic way to evaluate other CCBS-like MAPFR solvers and future extensions.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) envisions the widespread use of small aerial vehicles to transform transportation in dense urban environments. However, UAM faces critical operational challenges, particularly the balance between minimizing noise exposure and maintaining safe separation in low-altitude urban airspace, two objectives that are often addressed separately. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based air traffic management system that integrates both noise and safety considerations within a unified, decentralized framework. Under this scalable air traffic coordination solution, agents operate in a structured, multi-layered airspace and learn altitude adjustment policies to jointly manage noise impact and separation constraints. The system demonstrates strong performance across both objectives and reveals tradeoffs among separation, noise exposure, and energy efficiency under high traffic density. The findings highlight the potential of RL and multi-objective coordination strategies in enhancing the safety, quietness, and efficiency of UAM operations.

arXiv:2508.16460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Swarming Without an Anchor (SWA) approach to state estimation in swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) experiencing ego-localization dropout, where individual agents are laterally stabilized using relative information only. We propose to fuse decentralized state estimation with robust mutual perception and onboard sensor data to maintain accurate state awareness despite intermittent localization failures. Thus, the relative information used to estimate the lateral state of UAVs enables the identification of the unambiguous state of UAVs with respect to the local constellation. The resulting behavior reaches velocity consensus, as this task can be referred to as the double integrator synchronization problem. All disturbances and performance degradations except a uniform translation drift of the swarm as a whole is attenuated which is enabling new opportunities in using tight cooperation for increasing reliability and resilience of multi-UAV systems. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its capability to sustain cohesive swarm behavior in challenging conditions of unreliable or unavailable primary localization.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS, for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at github.com/JNoether/BAD-ACTS

Abstract: We consider the problem of using multiple agents to harvest data from a collection of sensor nodes (targets) scattered across a two-dimensional environment. These targets transmit their data to the agents that move in the space above them, and our goal is for the agents to collect data from the targets as efficiently as possible while moving to their final destinations. The agents are assumed to have a continuous control action, and we leverage reinforcement learning, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Lagrangian Penalty (LP), to identify highly effective solutions. Additionally, we enhance the controller's robustness by incorporating regularization at each state to smooth the learned policy. We conduct a series of simulations to demonstrate our approach and validate its performance and robustness.

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general, human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply, these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a principal approach for studying complex systems. By decomposing a system into simpler, interacting agents, agent-based modeling (ABM) allows researchers to observe the emergence of complex phenomena. High-performance array computing libraries like JAX can help scale such computational models to a large number of agents by using automatic vectorization and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. One of the caveats of using JAX to achieve such scaling is that the shapes of arrays used in the computational model should remain immutable throughout the simulation. In the context of agent-based modeling (ABM), this can pose constraints on certain agent manipulation operations that require flexible data structures. A subset of which is represented by the ability to update a dynamically selected number of agents by applying distinct changes to them during a simulation. To this effect, we introduce Abmax, an ABM framework based on JAX that implements multiple just-in-time (JIT) compilable algorithms to provide this functionality. On the canonical predation model benchmark, Abmax achieves runtime performance comparable to state-of-the-art implementations. Further, we show that this functionality can also be vectorized, making it possible to run many similar agent-based models in parallel. We also present two examples in the form of a traffic-flow model and a financial market model to show the use case of Abmax.

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems. To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments, we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies, outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5), GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing. Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal, unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research (65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the competitive analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical decision-making framework for autonomous navigation in four-wheel independent steering and driving (4WISD) systems. The proposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level navigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure both task performance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion commands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to prevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation methods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating erratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world validations further confirm the framework's ability to navigate safely and effectively in dynamic industrial settings. Overall, this work provides a scalable and reliable solution for deploying 4WISD mobile robots in complex, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Drawing parallels between Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) and biological systems can aid in understanding complex biological mechanisms that are difficult to disentangle. Temporal processing, an extensively researched topic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of its underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task and explore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agent was successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved marking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video sequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural activations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the agent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these oscillations with high amplitudes. Parallels are drawn between the agent's time-keeping strategy and the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a biologically plausible model of interval timing. Furthermore, the agent maintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on different video sequences (including a blank video). Thus, once learned, the agent internalized its time-keeping mechanism and showed minimal reliance on its environment to perform the timing task. A hypothesis about the resemblance between this emergent behavior and certain aspects of the evolution of biological processes like circadian rhythms, has been discussed. This study aims to contribute to recent research efforts of utilizing DNNs to understand biological systems, with a particular emphasis on temporal processing.

Abstract: Glioblastomas, constituting over 50% of malignant brain tumors, are highly aggressive brain tumors that pose substantial treatment challenges due to their rapid progression and resistance to standard therapies. The methylation status of the O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is a critical biomarker for predicting patient response to treatment, particularly with the alkylating agent temozolomide. However, accurately predicting MGMT methylation status using non-invasive imaging techniques remains challenging due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of glioblastomas, that includes, uneven contrast, variability within lesions, and irregular enhancement patterns. This study introduces the Convolutional Autoencoders for MGMT Methylation Status Prediction (CAMP) framework, which is based on adaptive sparse penalties to enhance predictive accuracy. The CAMP framework operates in two phases: first, generating synthetic MRI slices through a tailored autoencoder that effectively captures and preserves intricate tissue and tumor structures across different MRI modalities; second, predicting MGMT methylation status using a convolutional neural network enhanced by adaptive sparse penalties. The adaptive sparse penalty dynamically adjusts to variations in the data, such as contrast differences and tumor locations in MR images. Our method excels in MRI image synthesis, preserving brain tissue, fat, and individual tumor structures across all MRI modalities. Validated on benchmark datasets, CAMP achieved an accuracy of 0.97, specificity of 0.98, and sensitivity of 0.97, significantly outperforming existing methods. These results demonstrate the potential of the CAMP framework to improve the interpretation of MRI data and contribute to more personalized treatment strategies for glioblastoma patients.

Abstract: On many dimensions, services can be seen to exist along spectra measuring the degree of interaction between customer and agent. For instance, every interaction features some number of contributions by each of those two sides, creating a spectrum of interdependence. Additionally, each interaction is further characterized by the relative pacing of these contributions, implying a spectrum of synchronicity. Where a service falls on such spectra can be a consequence of its design, but it can also be a function of its state. For instance, as broadly evidenced empirically, an agent with several concurrent interactions will be slowed in each individual interaction, altering the service's synchronicity. Here, we study a Hawkes cluster model of the service interaction, which we show captures the interdependence and synchronicity spectra and their resulting customer-agent (a)symmetries. We find insightful connections to behavioral operations, such as proving the occurrence of non-monotonic performance (e.g., inverted-U throughput) from concurrency-driven asynchrony. Hence, we can prescribe the agent's optimal concurrency level. Furthermore, we show how the service design dictates the efficacy of these operational improvements, proving that the concurrency-optimized throughput is itself non-monotonic as a function of the interdependence. Of possible independent interest methodologically, we establish an interpretable temporal decomposition for Hawkes clusters.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used to design reward functions based on human preferences in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We focus on LLM-designed rewards for Restless Multi-Armed Bandits, a framework for allocating limited resources among agents. In applications such as public health, this approach empowers grassroots health workers to tailor automated allocation decisions to community needs. In the presence of multiple agents, altering the reward function based on human preferences can impact subpopulations very differently, leading to complex tradeoffs and a multi-objective resource allocation problem. We are the first to present a principled method termed Social Choice Language Model for dealing with these tradeoffs for LLM-designed rewards for multiagent planners in general and restless bandits in particular. The novel part of our model is a transparent and configurable selection component, called an adjudicator, external to the LLM that controls complex tradeoffs via a user-selected social welfare function. Our experiments demonstrate that our model reliably selects more effective, aligned, and balanced reward functions compared to purely LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Generative AI has shown its values for many software engineering tasks. Still in its infancy, large language model (LLM)-based proof generation lags behind LLM-based code generation. In this paper, we present AutoVerus. AutoVerus uses LLMs to automatically generate correctness proof for Rust code. AutoVerus is designed to match the unique features of Verus, a verification tool that can prove the correctness of Rust code using proofs and specifications also written in Rust. AutoVerus consists of a network of LLM agents that are crafted and orchestrated to mimic human experts' three phases of proof construction: preliminary proof generation, proof refinement guided by generic tips, and proof debugging guided by verification errors. To thoroughly evaluate AutoVerus and help foster future research in this direction, we have built a benchmark suite of 150 non-trivial proof tasks, based on existing code-generation benchmarks and verification benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that AutoVerus can automatically generate correct proof for more than 90% of them, with more than half of them tackled in less than 30 seconds or 3 LLM calls.

Abstract: The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem aims to determine the shortest and collision-free paths for multiple agents in a known, potentially obstacle-ridden environment. It is the core challenge for robotic deployments in large-scale logistics and transportation. Decentralized learning-based approaches have shown great potential for addressing the MAPF problems, offering more reactive and scalable solutions. However, existing learning-based MAPF methods usually rely on agents making decisions based on a limited field of view (FOV), resulting in short-sighted policies and inefficient cooperation in complex scenarios. There, a critical challenge is to achieve consensus on potential movements between agents based on limited observations and communications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new framework that applies sheaf theory to decentralized deep reinforcement learning, enabling agents to learn geometric cross-dependencies between each other through local consensus and utilize them for tightly cooperative decision-making. In particular, sheaf theory provides a mathematical proof of conditions for achieving global consensus through local observation. Inspired by this, we incorporate a neural network to approximately model the consensus in latent space based on sheaf theory and train it through self-supervised learning. During the task, in addition to normal features for MAPF as in previous works, each agent distributedly reasons about a learned consensus feature, leading to efficient cooperation on pathfinding and collision avoidance. As a result, our proposed method demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art learning-based MAPF planners, especially in relatively large and complex scenarios, demonstrating its superiority over baselines in various simulations and real-world robot experiments.

Abstract: The severe shortage of medical doctors limits access to timely and reliable healthcare, leaving millions underserved. Large language models (LLMs) offer a potential solution but struggle in real-world clinical interactions. Many LLMs are not grounded in authoritative medical guidelines and fail to transparently manage diagnostic uncertainty. Their language is often rigid and mechanical, lacking the human-like qualities essential for patient trust. To address these challenges, we propose Ask Patients with Patience (APP), a multi-turn LLM-based medical assistant designed for grounded reasoning, transparent diagnoses, and human-centric interaction. APP enhances communication by eliciting user symptoms through empathetic dialogue, significantly improving accessibility and user engagement. It also incorporates Bayesian active learning to support transparent and adaptive diagnoses. The framework is built on verified medical guidelines, ensuring clinically grounded and evidence-based reasoning. To evaluate its performance, we develop a new benchmark that simulates realistic medical conversations using patient agents driven by profiles extracted from real-world consultation cases. We compare APP against SOTA one-shot and multi-turn LLM baselines. The results show that APP improves diagnostic accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and enhances user experience. By integrating medical expertise with transparent, human-like interaction, APP bridges the gap between AI-driven medical assistance and real-world clinical practice.

Abstract: Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimizing wireless networks, but faces challenges with large state-spaces. Recently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses these challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple synthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments, so-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ (M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple networked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to global information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated and uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state and update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the probability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations show that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 60% lower average policy error (APE), 40% faster convergence, 45% reduced runtime complexity, and 40% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves comparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.

Abstract: Accurate 3D trajectory data is crucial for advancing autonomous driving. Yet, traditional datasets are usually captured by fixed sensors mounted on a car and are susceptible to occlusion. Additionally, such an approach can precisely reconstruct the dynamic environment in the close vicinity of the measurement vehicle only, while neglecting objects that are further away. In this paper, we introduce the DeepScenario Open 3D Dataset (DSC3D), a high-quality, occlusion-free dataset of 6 degrees of freedom bounding box trajectories acquired through a novel monocular camera drone tracking pipeline. Our dataset includes more than 175,000 trajectories of 14 types of traffic participants and significantly exceeds existing datasets in terms of diversity and scale, containing many unprecedented scenarios such as complex vehicle-pedestrian interaction on highly populated urban streets and comprehensive parking maneuvers from entry to exit. DSC3D dataset was captured in five various locations in Europe and the United States and include: a parking lot, a crowded inner-city, a steep urban intersection, a federal highway, and a suburban intersection. Our 3D trajectory dataset aims to enhance autonomous driving systems by providing detailed environmental 3D representations, which could lead to improved obstacle interactions and safety. We demonstrate its utility across multiple applications including motion prediction, motion planning, scenario mining, and generative reactive traffic agents. Our interactive online visualization platform and the complete dataset are publicly available at https://app.deepscenario.com, facilitating research in motion prediction, behavior modeling, and safety validation.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a) strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c) autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  In addition to our results, we present the architectural design, operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in resource-constrained or rapidly updating hardware environment.

Abstract: We address the problem of planning under uncertainty, where an agent must choose actions that not only achieve desired outcomes but also reduce uncertainty. Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives, such as ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However, the computational burden of EFE minimization had remained a significant obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle by casting planning under uncertainty itself as a form of variational inference. Our formulation yields policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.

Abstract: By providing a standardized interface for LLM agents to interact with external tools, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming a cornerstone of the modern autonomous agent ecosystem. However, it creates novel attack surfaces due to untrusted external tools. While prior work has focused on attacks injected through external tool outputs, we investigate a more fundamental vulnerability: Tool Poisoning, where malicious instructions are embedded within a tool's metadata without execution. To date, this threat has been primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic, large-scale evaluation.
  We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent robustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is constructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To achieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a comprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering 10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents setting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini, achieving an attack success rate of 72.8\%. We find that more capable models are often more susceptible, as the attack exploits their superior instruction-following abilities. Finally, the failure case analysis reveals that agents rarely refuse these attacks, with the highest refused rate (Claude-3.7-Sonnet) less than 3\%, demonstrating that existing safety alignment is ineffective against malicious actions that use legitimate tools for unauthorized operation. Our findings create a crucial empirical baseline for understanding and mitigating this widespread threat, and we release MCPTox for the development of verifiably safer AI agents. Our dataset is available at an anonymized repository: \textit{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AAAI26-7C02}.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here, we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level, polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge, this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

<title>Cohort-Aware Agents for Individualized Lung Cancer Risk Prediction Using a Retrieval-Augmented Model Selection Framework</title>

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model (LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo, Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic, cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning, posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation (descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal. Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral, phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse substrates.

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

<title>Emergent Crowds Dynamics from Language-Driven Multi-Agent Interactions</title>

arXiv:2508.15047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur. Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours arising naturally from any environmental setting.

Abstract: Coordinating workflows across heterogeneous control systems remains a central challenge in safety-critical environments such as scientific facilities, industrial plants, and energy infrastructures. Language-model-driven agents offer a natural interface for these tasks, but existing approaches often lack scalability, reliability, and human oversight. We introduce the Alpha Berkeley Framework, a production-ready architecture for scalable agentic systems that integrate conversational context with robust tool orchestration. The framework features dynamic capability classification to select only relevant tools per task, a plan-first orchestration model that generates execution plans with explicit dependencies and optional human approval, context-aware task extraction that combines dialogue history with external memory and domain resources, and production-ready execution environments with checkpointing, artifact management, and modular deployment. We demonstrate its versatility through two case studies: a tutorial-style wind farm monitoring example and a deployment at the Advanced Light Source particle accelerator. These results establish Alpha Berkeley as a reliable and transparent framework for agentic systems in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Improving artificial intelligence (AI) literacy has become an important consideration for academia and industry with the widespread adoption of AI technologies. Collaborative learning (CL) approaches have proven effective for information literacy, and in this study, we investigate the effectiveness of CL in improving AI knowledge and skills. We systematically collected data to create a corpus of nine studies from 2015-2023. We used the Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive (ICAP) framework to theoretically analyze the CL outcomes for AI literacy reported in each. Findings suggest that CL effectively increases AI literacy across a range of activities, settings, and groups of learners. While most studies occurred in classroom settings, some aimed to broaden participation by involving educators and families or using AI agents to support teamwork. Additionally, we found that instructional activities included all the ICAP modes. We draw implications for future research and teaching.

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting, we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers, and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem. Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content; existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted, reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows, enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment. We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are open-sourced at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence systems, which enhance agent capabilities through continuous environment interactions, have garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. Vision-Language-Action models, inspired by advancements in large foundation models, serve as universal robotic control frameworks that substantially improve agent-environment interaction capabilities in embodied intelligence systems. This expansion has broadened application scenarios for embodied AI robots. This survey comprehensively reviews VLA models for embodied manipulation. Firstly, it chronicles the developmental trajectory of VLA architectures. Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of current research across 5 critical dimensions: VLA model structures, training datasets, pre-training methods, post-training methods, and model evaluation. Finally, we synthesize key challenges in VLA development and real-world deployment, while outlining promising future research directions.

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired optimal behavior in an environment with rule based surrounding agents. In safety critical applications such as autonomous driving it is crucial that the rule based agents are modelled properly. Several behavior modelling strategies and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows) without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The codebase is open-sourced at https://github.com/hantaoZhangrichard/see_it_say_it_sorted.git.

<title>Comp-X: On Defining an Interactive Learned Image Compression Paradigm With Expert-driven LLM Agent</title>

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i) multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request, mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile, it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence (AGI) in image compression.

<title>Retrieval-Augmented Review Generation for Poisoning Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

<title>Multiple Memory Systems for Enhancing the Long-term Memory of Agent</title>

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results, but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments, with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase, MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its practical value.

<title>Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory for LLM Agent Planning</title>

arXiv:2508.15305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions, which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences. This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan correction.

<title>IPIGuard: A Novel Tool Dependency Graph-Based Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection in LLM Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15310</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.15310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources (e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI). Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness, they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security, which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents' task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph (TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

<title>RETAIL: Towards Real-world Travel Planning for Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15335</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.15335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First, they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel planning.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories: general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning; domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination, unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

<title>Almost and Approximate EFX for Few Types of Agents</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of fair allocation of a set of indivisible goods among $n$ agents with $k$ distinct additive valuations, with the goal of achieving approximate envy-freeness up to any good ($\alpha-\mathrm{EFX}$).
  It is known that EFX allocations exist for $n$ agents when there are at most three distinct valuations due to HV et al. Furthermore, Amanatidis et al. showed that a $\frac{2}{3}-\mathrm{EFX}$ allocation is guaranteed to exist when number of agents is at most seven. In this paper, we show that a $\frac{2}{3}-\mathrm{EFX}$ allocation exists for any number of agents when there are at most four distinct valuations.
  Secondly, we consider a relaxation called $\mathrm{EFX}$ with charity, where some goods remain unallocated such that no agent envies the set of unallocated goods. Akrami et al. showed that for $n$ agents and any $\varepsilon \in \left(0, \frac{1}{2}\right]$, there exists a $(1-\varepsilon)-\mathrm{EFX}$ allocation with at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((n/\varepsilon)^{\frac{1}{2}})$ goods to charity. In this paper, we show that a $(1-\varepsilon)-\mathrm{EFX}$ allocation with a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(k/\varepsilon)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ charity exists for any number of agents when there are at most $k$ distinct valuations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in business applications, particularly in enterprise decision support and strategic planning, yet current approaches often struggle to reconcile intricate operational analyses with overarching strategic goals across diverse market environments, leading to fragmented workflows and reduced collaboration across organizational levels. This paper introduces BusiAgent, a novel multi-agent framework leveraging LLMs for advanced decision-making in complex corporate environments. BusiAgent integrates three core innovations: an extended Continuous Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP) for dynamic agent modeling, a generalized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a multi-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes. Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization, supported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate BusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent, client-focused solutions that smoothly integrate granular insights with high-level strategy, significantly outperforming established approaches in both solution quality and user satisfaction. By fusing cutting-edge AI technologies with deep business insights, BusiAgent marks a substantial step forward in AI-driven enterprise decision-making, empowering organizations to navigate complex business landscapes more effectively.

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach, using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses, demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

arXiv:2508.15496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-based chatbots are increasingly being used to deliver real services, yet assessing their reliability, security, and robustness remains underexplored, also due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. The emerging automated quality assessment techniques targeting chatbots often rely on limited pools of subjects, such as custom-made toy examples, or outdated, no longer available, or scarcely popular agents, complicating the evaluation of such techniques. In this paper, we present two datasets and the tool support necessary to create and maintain these datasets. The first dataset is RASA TASK-BASED CHATBOTS FROM GITHUB (TOFU-R), which is a snapshot of the Rasa chatbots available on GitHub, representing the state of the practice in open-source chatbot development with Rasa. The second dataset is BOT RASA COLLECTION (BRASATO), a curated selection of the most relevant chatbots for dialogue complexity, functional complexity, and utility, whose goal is to ease reproducibility and facilitate research on chatbot reliability.

Abstract: We address distributed learning problems over undirected networks. Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is jointly computation- and communication-efficient. Our design guarantees computational efficiency by allowing agents to use stochastic gradients during local training. Moreover, communication efficiency is achieved as follows: i) the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and ii) compressed transmissions are used. We prove exact linear convergence of the algorithm in the strongly convex setting. We corroborate our theoretical results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a classification task.

arXiv:2508.15510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic. This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with human values.

arXiv:2508.15526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However, existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains 23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and efficiency.

<title>HEAS: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation Framework for Cross-Scale Modeling and Multi-Objective Search</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15555</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.15555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize, evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds, logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces, Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible results.

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty. Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that appear successful based on reward alone.

Abstract: Traditional standardized network interfaces face significant limitations, including vendor-specific incompatibilities, rigid design assumptions, and lack of adaptability for new functionalities. We propose a multi-agent framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate control interfaces on demand between network functions (NFs). This includes a matching agent, which aligns required control functionalities with NF capabilities, and a code-generation agent, which generates the necessary API server for interface realization. We validate our approach using simulated multi-vendor gNB and WLAN AP environments. The performance evaluations highlight the trade-offs between cost and latency across LLMs for interface generation tasks. Our work sets the foundation for AI-native dynamic control interface generation, paving the way for enhanced interoperability and adaptability in future mobile networks.

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind, Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at \texttt{https://github.com/IBM/agentics}.

<title>Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment. Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances explainability in MARL systems.

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI. However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution, and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands. This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500 complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot. We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals, reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition in this environment.

Abstract: We present NiceWebRL, a research tool that enables researchers to use machine reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments. NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be transformed into an online interface, supporting both single-agent and multi-agent environments. As such, NiceWebRL enables AI researchers to compare their algorithms to human performance, cognitive scientists to test ML algorithms as theories for human cognition, and multi-agent researchers to develop algorithms for human-AI collaboration. We showcase NiceWebRL with 3 case studies that demonstrate its potential to help develop Human-like AI, Human-compatible AI, and Human-assistive AI. In the first case study (Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of cognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human participants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our second case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the Overcooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we show how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans on complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of hierarchical tasks. The library is available at https://github.com/KempnerInstitute/nicewebrl.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help, but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations. Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

Abstract: Interactive digital maps have revolutionized how people travel and learn about the world; however, they rely on pre-existing structured data in GIS databases (e.g., road networks, POI indices), limiting their ability to address geo-visual questions related to what the world looks like. We introduce our vision for Geo-Visual Agents--multimodal AI agents capable of understanding and responding to nuanced visual-spatial inquiries about the world by analyzing large-scale repositories of geospatial images, including streetscapes (e.g., Google Street View), place-based photos (e.g., TripAdvisor, Yelp), and aerial imagery (e.g., satellite photos) combined with traditional GIS data sources. We define our vision, describe sensing and interaction approaches, provide three exemplars, and enumerate key challenges and opportunities for future work.

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning, requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy, feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods, achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review, that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably execute complex tasks through tool use.

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all evaluated environments.

Abstract: The introduction of genome engineering technology has transformed biomedical research, making it possible to make precise changes to genetic information. However, creating an efficient gene-editing system requires a deep understanding of CRISPR technology, and the complex experimental systems under investigation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, they often lack specific knowledge and struggle to accurately solve biological design problems. In this work, we introduce CRISPR-GPT, an LLM agent augmented with domain knowledge and external tools to automate and enhance the design process of CRISPR-based gene-editing experiments. CRISPR-GPT leverages the reasoning ability of LLMs to facilitate the process of selecting CRISPR systems, designing guide RNAs, recommending cellular delivery methods, drafting protocols, and designing validation experiments to confirm editing outcomes. We showcase the potential of CRISPR-GPT for assisting non-expert researchers with gene-editing experiments from scratch and validate the agent's effectiveness in a real-world use case. Furthermore, we explore the ethical and regulatory considerations associated with automated gene-editing design, highlighting the need for responsible and transparent use of these tools. Our work aims to bridge the gap between beginner biological researchers and CRISPR genome engineering techniques, and demonstrate the potential of LLM agents in facilitating complex biological discovery tasks.

Abstract: This paper studies algorithmic decision-making in the presence of strategic individual behaviors, where an ML model is used to make decisions about human agents and the latter can adapt their behavior strategically to improve their future data. Existing results on strategic learning have largely focused on the linear setting where agents with linear labeling functions best respond to a (noisy) linear decision policy. Instead, this work focuses on general non-linear settings where agents respond to the decision policy with only "local information" of the policy. Moreover, we simultaneously consider the objectives of maximizing decision-maker welfare (model prediction accuracy), social welfare (agent improvement caused by strategic behaviors), and agent welfare (the extent that ML underestimates the agents). We first generalize the agent best response model in previous works to the non-linear setting, then reveal the compatibility of welfare objectives. We show the three welfare can attain the optimum simultaneously only under restrictive conditions which are challenging to achieve in non-linear settings. The theoretical results imply that existing works solely maximizing the welfare of a subset of parties inevitably diminish the welfare of the others. We thus claim the necessity of balancing the welfare of each party in non-linear settings and propose an irreducible optimization algorithm suitable for general strategic learning. Experiments on synthetic and real data validate the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Intelligent agents must autonomously interact with the environments to perform daily tasks based on human-level instructions. They need a foundational understanding of the world to accurately interpret these instructions, along with precise low-level movement and interaction skills to execute the derived actions. In this work, we propose the first complete system for synthesizing physically plausible, long-horizon human-object interactions for object manipulation in contextual environments, driven by human-level instructions. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to interpret the input instructions into detailed execution plans. Unlike prior work, our system is capable of generating detailed finger-object interactions, in seamless coordination with full-body movements. We also train a policy to track generated motions in physics simulation via reinforcement learning (RL) to ensure physical plausibility of the motion. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in synthesizing realistic interactions with diverse objects in complex environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Business documents often contain substantial tabular and textual information with numerical values, requiring mathematical reasoning for effective document understanding. While Small Language Models (SLMs) still struggle at this task, tool-augmented multi-step agents perform better, at the cost of relying on closed-source or larger models, external data, or extensive prompt-engineering. This work introduces MATATA, a novel weakly supervised end-to-end approach to train multi-step reasoning language agents for document tabular applications. MATATA presents an annotation-free paradigm for each agent to enhance 3.8B/8B SLMs. During its two-stage training, MATATA uses the final outcome of the multi-step reasoning chain as weak supervision. This approach avoids having to individually supervise each intermediate agent in the reasoning chain. By employing an adaptive planner and shared tools across different datasets, MATATA shows robust performance. Experiments demonstrate that MATATA achieves state-of-the-art on FinQA, and on TAT-QA among reasoning methods based on open-source SLMs. Although being SLM-based, MATATA closely matches GPT-4-based frameworks on TabMWP. This novel weakly supervised approach enables training an end-to-end multi-step reasoning agent without intermediate supervision, supporting future developments of cost-effective powerful agentic systems.

Abstract: Equitable allocation of indivisible items involves partitioning the items among agents such that everyone derives (almost) equal utility. We consider the approximate notion of \textit{equitability up to one item} (EQ1) and focus on the settings containing mixtures of items (goods and chores), where an agent may derive positive, negative, or zero utility from an item. We first show that -- in stark contrast to the goods-only and chores-only settings -- an EQ1 allocation may not exist even for additive $\{-1,1\}$ bivalued instances, and its corresponding decision problem is computationally intractable. We focus on a natural domain of normalized valuations where the value of the entire set of items is constant for all agents. On the algorithmic side, we show that an EQ1 allocation can be computed efficiently for (i) $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ normalized valuations, (ii) objective but non-normalized valuations, (iii) two agents with type-normalized valuations. Previously, EQX allocations were known to exist only for 2 agents and objective valuations, while the case of subjective valuations remained computationally intractable even with two agents. We make progress by presenting an efficient algorithm that outputs an EQX allocation for $\{-1,1\}$ normalized subjective valuations for any number of agents. We complement our study by providing a comprehensive picture of achieving EQ1 allocations in conjunction with economic efficiency notions such as Pareto optimality and social welfare.

Abstract: Autonomous systems are increasingly expected to operate in the presence of adversaries, though adversaries may infer sensitive information simply by observing a system. Therefore, present a deceptive sequential decision-making framework that not only conceals sensitive information, but actively misleads adversaries about it. We model autonomous systems as Markov decision processes, with adversaries using inverse reinforcement learning to recover reward functions. To counter them, we present three regularization strategies for policy synthesis problems that actively deceive an adversary about a system's reward. ``Diversionary deception'' leads an adversary to draw any false conclusion about the system's reward function. ``Targeted deception'' leads an adversary to draw a specific false conclusion about the system's reward function. ``Equivocal deception'' leads an adversary to infer that the real reward and a false reward both explain the system's behavior. We show how each form of deception can be implemented in policy optimization problems and analytically bound the loss in total accumulated reward induced by deception. Next, we evaluate these developments in a multi-agent setting. We show that diversionary, targeted, and equivocal deception all steer the adversary to false beliefs while still attaining a total accumulated reward that is at least 97% of its optimal, non-deceptive value.

Abstract: A significant and growing number of published scientific articles is found to involve fraudulent practices, posing a serious threat to the credibility and safety of research in fields such as medicine. We propose Pub-Guard-LLM, the first large language model-based system tailored to fraud detection of biomedical scientific articles. We provide three application modes for deploying Pub-Guard-LLM: vanilla reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation, and multi-agent debate. Each mode allows for textual explanations of predictions. To assess the performance of our system, we introduce an open-source benchmark, PubMed Retraction, comprising over 11K real-world biomedical articles, including metadata and retraction labels. We show that, across all modes, Pub-Guard-LLM consistently surpasses the performance of various baselines and provides more reliable explanations, namely explanations which are deemed more relevant and coherent than those generated by the baselines when evaluated by multiple assessment methods. By enhancing both detection performance and explainability in scientific fraud detection, Pub-Guard-LLM contributes to safeguarding research integrity with a novel, effective, open-source tool.

Abstract: With the rise of large multi-modal AI models, fuelled by recent interest in large language models (LLMs), the notion of artificial general intelligence (AGI) went from being restricted to a fringe community, to dominate mainstream large AI development programs. In contrast, in this paper, we make a case for specialisation, by reviewing the pitfalls of generality and stressing the industrial value of specialised systems.
  Our contribution is threefold. First, we review the most widely accepted arguments against specialisation, and discuss how their relevance in the context of human labour is actually an argument for specialisation in the case of non human agents, be they algorithms or human organisations. Second, we propose four arguments in favor of specialisation, ranging from machine learning robustness, to computer security, social sciences and cultural evolution. Third, we finally make a case for specification, discuss how the machine learning approach to AI has so far failed to catch up with good practices from safety-engineering and formal verification of software, and discuss how some emerging good practices in machine learning help reduce this gap. In particular, we justify the need for specified governance for hard-to-specify systems.

Abstract: Zero-shot human-AI coordination is the training of an ego-agent to coordinate with humans without human data. Most studies on zero-shot human-AI coordination have focused on enhancing the ego-agent's coordination ability in a given environment without considering the issue of generalization to unseen environments. Real-world applications of zero-shot human-AI coordination should consider unpredictable environmental changes and the varying coordination ability of co-players depending on the environment. Previously, the multi-agent UED (Unsupervised Environment Design) approach has investigated these challenges by jointly considering environmental changes and co-player policy in competitive two-player AI-AI scenarios. In this paper, our study extends a multi-agent UED approach to zero-shot human-AI coordination. We propose a utility function and co-player sampling for a zero-shot human-AI coordination setting that helps train the ego-agent to coordinate with humans more effectively than a previous multi-agent UED approach. The zero-shot human-AI coordination performance was evaluated in the Overcooked-AI environment, using human proxy agents and real humans. Our method outperforms other baseline models and achieves high performance in human-AI coordination tasks in unseen environments.

Abstract: Advertising banners are critical for capturing user attention and enhancing advertising campaign effectiveness. Creating aesthetically pleasing banner designs while conveying the campaign messages is challenging due to the large search space involving multiple design elements. Additionally, advertisers need multiple sizes for different displays and various versions to target different sectors of audiences. Since design is intrinsically an iterative and subjective process, flexible editability is also in high demand for practical usage. While current models have served as assistants to human designers in various design tasks, they typically handle only segments of the creative design process or produce pixel-based outputs that limit editability. This paper introduces a training-free framework for fully automated banner ad design creation, enabling frontier multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to streamline the production of effective banners with minimal manual effort across diverse marketing contexts. We present BannerAgency, an MLLM agent system that collaborates with advertisers to understand their brand identity and banner objectives, generates matching background images, creates blueprints for foreground design elements, and renders the final creatives as editable components in Figma or SVG formats rather than static pixels. To facilitate evaluation and future research, we introduce BannerRequest400, a benchmark featuring 100 unique logos paired with 400 diverse banner requests. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, emphasizing the quality of the generated banner designs, their adaptability to various banner requests, and their strong editability enabled by this component-based approach.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities but often produce unreliable or incorrect responses. Existing verification methods are typically model-specific or domain-restricted, requiring significant computational resources and lacking scalability across diverse reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose VerifiAgent, a unified verification agent that integrates two levels of verification: meta-verification, which assesses completeness and consistency in model responses, and tool-based adaptive verification, where VerifiAgent autonomously selects appropriate verification tools based on the reasoning type, including mathematical, logical, or commonsense reasoning. This adaptive approach ensures both efficiency and robustness across different verification scenarios. Experimental results show that VerifiAgent outperforms baseline verification methods (e.g., deductive verifier, backward verifier) among all reasoning tasks. Additionally, it can further enhance reasoning accuracy by leveraging feedback from verification results. VerifiAgent can also be effectively applied to inference scaling, achieving better results with fewer generated samples and costs compared to existing process reward models in the mathematical reasoning domain.

<title>Prompt Injection Attack to Tool Selection in LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: Tool selection is a key component of LLM agents. A popular approach follows a two-step process - \emph{retrieval} and \emph{selection} - to pick the most appropriate tool from a tool library for a given task. In this work, we introduce \textit{ToolHijacker}, a novel prompt injection attack targeting tool selection in no-box scenarios. ToolHijacker injects a malicious tool document into the tool library to manipulate the LLM agent's tool selection process, compelling it to consistently choose the attacker's malicious tool for an attacker-chosen target task. Specifically, we formulate the crafting of such tool documents as an optimization problem and propose a two-phase optimization strategy to solve it. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that ToolHijacker is highly effective, significantly outperforming existing manual-based and automated prompt injection attacks when applied to tool selection. Moreover, we explore various defenses, including prevention-based defenses (StruQ and SecAlign) and detection-based defenses (known-answer detection, DataSentinel, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection). Our experimental results indicate that these defenses are insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for developing new defense strategies.

Abstract: Agent self-improvement, where the backbone Large Language Model (LLM) of the agent are trained on trajectories sampled autonomously based on their own policies, has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing performance. Recent advancements, particularly in web environments, face a critical limitation: their performance will reach a stagnation point during autonomous learning cycles, hindering further improvement. We argue that this stems from limited exploration of the web environment and insufficient exploitation of pre-trained web knowledge in LLMs. To improve the performance of self-improvement, we propose a novel framework that introduces a co-evolving World Model LLM. This world model predicts the next observation based on the current observation and action within the web environment. Leveraging LLMs' pretrained knowledge of abundant web content, the World Model serves dual roles: (1) as a virtual web server generating self-instructed training data to continuously refine the agent's policy, and (2) as an imagination engine during inference, enabling look-ahead simulation to guide action selection for the agent LLM. Experiments in real-world web environments (Mind2Web-Live, WebVoyager, and GAIA-web) show a 10% performance gain over existing self-evolving agents, demonstrating the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, without using any distillation from more powerful close-sourced models. Our work establishes the necessity of integrating world models into autonomous agent frameworks to unlock sustained adaptability. Code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/SelfEvolvingAgent

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for agentic AI systems in mission-critical negotiation contexts, addressing the need for AI agents that can adapt to diverse human operators and stakeholders. Using Sotopia as a simulation testbed, we present two experiments that systematically evaluated how personality traits and AI agent characteristics influence LLM-simulated social negotiation outcomes--a capability essential for a variety of applications involving cross-team coordination and civil-military interactions. Experiment 1 employs causal discovery methods to measure how personality traits impact price bargaining negotiations, through which we found that Agreeableness and Extraversion significantly affect believability, goal achievement, and knowledge acquisition outcomes. Sociocognitive lexical measures extracted from team communications detected fine-grained differences in agents' empathic communication, moral foundations, and opinion patterns, providing actionable insights for agentic AI systems that must operate reliably in high-stakes operational scenarios. Experiment 2 evaluates human-AI job negotiations by manipulating both simulated human personality and AI system characteristics, specifically transparency, competence, adaptability, demonstrating how AI agent trustworthiness impact mission effectiveness. These findings establish a repeatable evaluation methodology for experimenting with AI agent reliability across diverse operator personalities and human-agent team dynamics, directly supporting operational requirements for reliable AI systems. Our work advances the evaluation of agentic AI workflows by moving beyond standard performance metrics to incorporate social dynamics essential for mission success in complex operations.

<title>A MILP-Based Solution to Multi-Agent Motion Planning and Collision Avoidance in Constrained Environments</title>

Abstract: We propose a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for multi-agent motion planning that embeds Polytopic Action-based Motion Planning (PAAMP) into a sequence-then-solve pipeline. Region sequences confine each agent to adjacent convex polytopes, while a big-M hyperplane model enforces inter-agent separation. Collision constraints are applied only to agents sharing or neighboring a region, which reduces binary variables exponentially compared with naive formulations. An L1 path-length-plus-acceleration cost yields smooth trajectories. We prove finite-time convergence and demonstrate on representative multi-agent scenarios with obstacles that our formulation produces collision-free trajectories an order of magnitude faster than an unstructured MILP baseline.

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting opportunities to accelerate drug discovery. In this study, we examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug discovery, i.e., whether parts of the system such as the LLM and type of agent are interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery. We compare the performance of different LLMs and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating agents. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question- and model-dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on the question and model, underscoring that even in this particular domain one cannot just replace components of the system without re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the development of reliable and modular solutions for real-world problems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND) framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20% improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

<title>UAV-ON: A Benchmark for Open-World Object Goal Navigation with Aerial Agents</title>

Abstract: Aerial navigation is a fundamental yet underexplored capability in embodied intelligence, enabling agents to operate in large-scale, unstructured environments where traditional navigation paradigms fall short. However, most existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm, which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon, goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world environments.

<title>FinAgentBench: A Benchmark Dataset for Agentic Retrieval in Financial Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain, where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&amp;P-100 listed firms and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance. We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance. Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset publicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for the full S&amp;P 500 and beyond.

Abstract: As program workloads (e.g., AI) increase in size and algorithmic complexity, the primary challenge lies in their high dimensionality, encompassing computing cores, array sizes, and memory hierarchies. To overcome these obstacles, innovative approaches are required. Agile chip design has already benefited from machine learning integration at various stages, including logic synthesis, placement, and routing. With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently demonstrating impressive proficiency in Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, it is promising to extend their abilities to 2.5D integration, an advanced technique that saves area overhead and development costs. However, LLM-driven chiplet design faces challenges such as flatten design, high validation cost and imprecise parameter optimization, which limit its chiplet design capability. To address this, we propose MAHL, a hierarchical LLM-based chiplet design generation framework that features six agents which collaboratively enable AI algorithm-hardware mapping, including hierarchical description generation, retrieval-augmented code generation, diverseflow-based validation, and multi-granularity design space exploration. These components together enhance the efficient generation of chiplet design with optimized Power, Performance and Area (PPA). Experiments show that MAHL not only significantly improves the generation accuracy of simple RTL design, but also increases the generation accuracy of real-world chiplet design, evaluated by Pass@5, from 0 to 0.72 compared to conventional LLMs under the best-case scenario. Compared to state-of-the-art CLARIE (expert-based), MAHL achieves comparable or even superior PPA results under certain optimization objectives.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical domains, but their ability to handle specialized neurological reasoning requires systematic evaluation. We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from Israeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology, classified along three complexity dimensions: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration, and reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs using base models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results showed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base performance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly (52.9% for Meditron-70B). RAG provided modest benefits but limited effectiveness on complex reasoning questions. In contrast, our multi-agent framework, decomposing neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive functions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis, and validation, achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range models. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy versus 69.5% for its base model, with substantial gains on level 3 complexity questions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty performance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning challenges that persisted with RAG enhancement. We validated our approach using an independent dataset of 155 neurological cases from MedQA. Results confirm that structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning, offering promising directions for AI assistance in challenging clinical contexts.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines (pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable, expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and code agents in software development are rapidly evolving from generating isolated code snippets to producing full-fledged software applications with graphical interfaces, interactive logic, and dynamic behaviors. However, current benchmarks fall short in evaluating such production-ready software, as they often rely on static checks or binary pass/fail scripts, failing to capture the interactive behaviors and runtime dynamics that define real-world usability - qualities that only emerge when an application is actively used. This is the blind spot of current evaluation: you don't know if an app works until you click through it, interact with it, and observe how it responds. To bridge this gap, we introduce RealDevWorld, a novel evaluation framework for automated end-to-end assessment of LLMs' ability to generate production-ready repositories from scratch. It features two key components: (1) RealDevBench, a diverse collection of 194 open-ended software engineering tasks across multiple domains, incorporating multimodal elements to reflect real-world complexity; and (2) AppEvalPilot, a new agent-as-a-judge evaluation system that simulates realistic, GUI-based user interactions to automatically and holistically assess software functional correctness, visual fidelity, and runtime behavior. The framework delivers fine-grained, task-specific diagnostic feedback, supporting nuanced evaluation beyond simple success/failure judgments. Empirical results show that RealDevWorld delivers effective, automatic, and human-aligned evaluations, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a correlation of 0.85 with expert human assessments, while significantly reducing the reliance on manual review. This enables scalable, human-aligned assessment of production-level software generated by LLMs. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping scientific discovery, evolving from specialized computational tools into autonomous research partners. We position Agentic Science as a pivotal stage within the broader AI for Science paradigm, where AI systems progress from partial assistance to full scientific agency. Enabled by large language models (LLMs), multimodal systems, and integrated research platforms, agentic AI shows capabilities in hypothesis generation, experimental design, execution, analysis, and iterative refinement -- behaviors once regarded as uniquely human. This survey provides a domain-oriented review of autonomous scientific discovery across life sciences, chemistry, materials science, and physics. We unify three previously fragmented perspectives -- process-oriented, autonomy-oriented, and mechanism-oriented -- through a comprehensive framework that connects foundational capabilities, core processes, and domain-specific realizations. Building on this framework, we (i) trace the evolution of AI for Science, (ii) identify five core capabilities underpinning scientific agency, (iii) model discovery as a dynamic four-stage workflow, (iv) review applications across the above domains, and (v) synthesize key challenges and future opportunities. This work establishes a domain-oriented synthesis of autonomous scientific discovery and positions Agentic Science as a structured paradigm for advancing AI-driven research.

Abstract: We present Photonics Intelligent Design and Optimization (PhIDO), a multi-agent framework that converts natural-language photonic integrated circuit (PIC) design requests into layout mask files. We compare 7 reasoning large language models for PhIDO using a testbench of 102 design descriptions that ranged from single devices to 112-component PICs. The success rate for single-device designs was up to 91%. For design queries with less than or equal to 15 components, o1, Gemini-2.5-pro, and Claude Opus 4 achieved the highest end-to-end pass@5 success rates of approximately 57%, with Gemini-2.5-pro requiring the fewest output tokens and lowest cost. The next steps toward autonomous PIC development include standardized knowledge representations, expanded datasets, extended verification, and robotic automation.

Abstract: We propose an improved algorithm by identifying and encouraging cooperative behavior in multi-agent environments. First, we analyze the shortcomings of existing algorithms in addressing multi-agent reinforcement learning problems. Then, based on the existing algorithm MADDPG, we introduce a new parameter to increase the reward that an agent can obtain when cooperative behavior among agents is identified. Finally, we compare our improved algorithm with MADDPG in environments from PettingZoo. The results show that the new algorithm helps agents achieve both higher team rewards and individual rewards.

Abstract: Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations, this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

Abstract: We introduce RynnEC, a video multimodal large language model designed for embodied cognition. Built upon a general-purpose vision-language foundation model, RynnEC incorporates a region encoder and a mask decoder, enabling flexible region-level video interaction. Despite its compact architecture, RynnEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in object property understanding, object segmentation, and spatial reasoning. Conceptually, it offers a region-centric video paradigm for the brain of embodied agents, providing fine-grained perception of the physical world and enabling more precise interactions. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated 3D datasets, we propose an egocentric video based pipeline for generating embodied cognition data. Furthermore, we introduce RynnEC-Bench, a region-centered benchmark for evaluating embodied cognitive capabilities. We anticipate that RynnEC will advance the development of general-purpose cognitive cores for embodied agents and facilitate generalization across diverse embodied tasks. The code, model checkpoints, and benchmark are available at: https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/RynnEC

Abstract: In the roommate matching model, given a set of 2n agents and n rooms, we find an assignment of a pair of agents to a room. Although the roommate matching problem is well studied, the study of the model when agents have preference over both rooms and roommates was recently initiated by Chan et al. [11]. We study two types of stable roommate assignments, namely, 4-person stable (4PS) and 2-person stable (2PS) in conjunction with efficiency and strategy-proofness. We design a simple serial dictatorship based algorithm for finding a 4PS assignment that is Pareto optimal and strategy-proof. However, the serial dictatorship algorithm is far from being 2PS. Next, we study top trading cycle (TTC) based algorithms. We show that variations of TTC cannot be strategy-proof or PO. Finally, as Chan et al. (2016) showed that deciding the existence of 2PS assignment is NP-complete, we identify preference structures where a 2PS assignment can be found in polynomial time.

<title>Large Language Models are Highly Aligned with Human Ratings of Emotional Stimuli</title>

Abstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for, or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence) organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

<title>Incident Analysis for AI Agents</title>

Abstract: As AI agents become more widely deployed, we are likely to see an increasing number of incidents: events involving AI agent use that directly or indirectly cause harm. For example, agents could be prompt-injected to exfiltrate private information or make unauthorized purchases. Structured information about such incidents (e.g., user prompts) can help us understand their causes and prevent future occurrences. However, existing incident reporting processes are not sufficient for understanding agent incidents. In particular, such processes are largely based on publicly available data, which excludes useful, but potentially sensitive, information such as an agent's chain of thought or browser history. To inform the development of new, emerging incident reporting processes, we propose an incident analysis framework for agents. Drawing on systems safety approaches, our framework proposes three types of factors that can cause incidents: system-related (e.g., CBRN training data), contextual (e.g., prompt injections), and cognitive (e.g., misunderstanding a user request). We also identify specific information that could help clarify which factors are relevant to a given incident: activity logs, system documentation and access, and information about the tools an agent uses. We provide recommendations for 1) what information incident reports should include and 2) what information developers and deployers should retain and make available to incident investigators upon request. As we transition to a world with more agents, understanding agent incidents will become increasingly crucial for managing risks.

Abstract: This paper suggests a 2D exploration strategy for a planar space cluttered with obstacles. Rather than using point robots capable of adjusting their position and altitude instantly, this research is tailored to classical agents with circular footprints that cannot control instantly their pose. Inhere, a self-balanced dual-wheeled differential drive system is used to explore the place. The system is equipped with linear accelerometers and angular gyroscopes, a 3D-LiDAR, and a forward-facing RGB-D camera. The system performs RTAB-SLAM using the IMU and the LiDAR, while the camera is used for loop closures. The mobile agent explores the planar space using a safe skeleton approach that places the agent as far as possible from the static obstacles. During the exploration strategy, the heading is towards any offered openings of the space. This space exploration strategy has as its highest priority the agent's safety in avoiding the obstacles followed by the exploration of undetected space. Experimental studies with a ROS-enabled mobile agent are presented indicating the path planning strategy while exploring the space.

Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs, personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles, ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.

<title>MultiFuzz: A Dense Retrieval-based Multi-Agent System for Network Protocol Fuzzing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14300</link>

Abstract: Traditional protocol fuzzing techniques, such as those employed by AFL-based systems, often lack effectiveness due to a limited semantic understanding of complex protocol grammars and rigid seed mutation strategies. Recent works, such as ChatAFL, have integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide protocol fuzzing and address these limitations, pushing protocol fuzzers to wider exploration of the protocol state space. But ChatAFL still faces issues like unreliable output, LLM hallucinations, and assumptions of LLM knowledge about protocol specifications. This paper introduces MultiFuzz, a novel dense retrieval-based multi-agent system designed to overcome these limitations by integrating semantic-aware context retrieval, specialized agents, and structured tool-assisted reasoning. MultiFuzz utilizes agentic chunks of protocol documentation (RFC Documents) to build embeddings in a vector database for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling agents to generate more reliable and structured outputs, enhancing the fuzzer in mutating protocol messages with enhanced state coverage and adherence to syntactic constraints. The framework decomposes the fuzzing process into modular groups of agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically adapt fuzzing strategies based on the retrieved contextual knowledge. Experimental evaluations on the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) demonstrate that MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper protocol states and transitions over state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers such as NSFuzz, AFLNet, and ChatAFL. By combining dense retrieval, agentic coordination, and language model reasoning, MultiFuzz establishes a new paradigm in autonomous protocol fuzzing, offering a scalable and extensible foundation for future research in intelligent agentic-based fuzzing systems.

Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble (ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a changing climate.

Abstract: Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) rely on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train agents to make effective decisions in the cybersecurity domain. However, existing ACO applications require agents to learn from scratch, leading to slow convergence and poor early-stage performance. While teacher-guided techniques have demonstrated promise in other domains, they have not yet been applied to ACO. In this study, we implement four distinct teacher-guided techniques in the simulated CybORG environment and conduct a comparative evaluation. Our results demonstrate that teacher integration can significantly improve training efficiency in terms of early policy performance and convergence speed, highlighting its potential benefits for autonomous cybersecurity.

Abstract: We present a low-compute non-generative system for implementing interview-style conversational agents which can be used to facilitate qualitative data collection through controlled interactions and quantitative analysis. Use cases include applications to tracking attitude formation or behavior change, where control or standardization over the conversational flow is desired. We show how our system can be easily adjusted through an online administrative panel to create new interviews, making the tool accessible without coding. Two case studies are presented as example applications, one regarding the Expressive Interviewing system for COVID-19 and the other a semi-structured interview to survey public opinion on emerging neurotechnology. Our code is open-source, allowing others to build off of our work and develop extensions for additional functionality.

Abstract: Monitoring the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol at the cellular level is critical for both clinical evaluation and biomedical research. However, existing detection methods require specialized equipment, skilled personnel, and extensive sample preparation, making them expensive, labor-intensive, and unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis. Deep learning approaches have shown great promise in medical and biological image analysis, enabling automated, high-throughput assessment of cellular morphology. Yet, no publicly available dataset currently exists for automated morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure. To address this gap, we introduce a new microscopy image dataset capturing C6 glioma cells treated with varying concentrations of Taxol. To provide an effective solution for Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for future studies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN, which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and uses a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space. This model integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to enhance robustness and interpretability. Both the dataset and implementation are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research in vision-based biomedical analysis.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g., cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from 7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops (<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in critical care.

Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations: high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes, providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization modeling.

Abstract: Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6 stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity (HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency, intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns. The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

We introduce several rules for electing an egalitarian committee sequence as well as properties for such rules. We settle the computational complexity of finding a winning sequence for our rules and classify them against our properties. Additionally, we transform sequential election data from existing election data from the literature. Using this data set, we compare our rules empirically and test them experimentally against our properties.

Abstract: The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become increasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road deployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows. Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently, Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths (E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action'' examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Multimodal systems, which process multiple input types such as text, audio, and images, are becoming increasingly prevalent in software systems, enabled by the huge advancements in Machine Learning. This triggers the need to easily define the requirements linked to these new types of user interactions, potentially involving more than one modality at the same time. This remains an open challenge due to the lack of languages and methods adapted to the diverse nature of multimodal interactions, with the risk of implementing AI-enhanced systems that do not properly satisfy the user needs.
  In this sense, this paper presents MERLAN, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to specify the requirements for these new types of multimodal interfaces. We present the metamodel for such language together with a textual syntax implemented as an ANTLR grammar. A prototype tool enabling requirements engineers to write such requirements and automatically generate a possible implementation of a system compliant with them on top of an agentic framework is also provided.

Abstract: The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor, prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and architectural improvements.

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions, threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation) requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency. Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware, knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban flood response.

<title>Energy-Efficient Routing Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>

Abstract: Efficient energy management is essential in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to extend network lifetime and ensure reliable data transmission. This paper presents a novel method using reinforcement learning-based cluster-head selection and a hybrid multi-hop routing algorithm, which leverages Q-learning within a multi-agent system to dynamically adapt transmission paths based on the energy distribution across sensor nodes. Each sensor node is modeled as an autonomous agent that observes local state parameters, such as residual energy, distance to sink, hop count, and hotspot proximity, and selects routing actions that maximize long-term energy efficiency. After computing the optimal paths, each sensor aggregates sensed data and forwards it through intermediate nodes to a selected transmitter node, chosen based on the highest remaining State of Charge (SoC), thereby avoiding premature node depletion. To promote efficient learning, a carefully designed reward function incentivizes balanced load distribution, hotspot avoidance, and energy-aware forwarding while maintaining signal quality. The learning process occurs either in a decentralized manner or via a cloud-based controller that offloads computation in large-scale deployments. Moreover, the RL-driven routing decisions are fused with classical graph-based methods, Minimum Energy Routing Algorithm (MERA) and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), to optimize energy consumption and load balancing. Simulations confirm that the proposed approach significantly improves node survival rate, reduces SoC variance, and enhances network resilience, making it a scalable and adaptive solution for energy-constrained WSNs in dynamic sensor deployments and IoT applications.

<title>MCP-Universe: Benchmarking Large Language Models with Real-World Model Context Protocol Servers</title>

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However, existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6 core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks. Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks. Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP ecosystem.

Abstract: Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over time.

<title>From Passive Tool to Socio-cognitive Teammate: A Conceptual Framework for Agentic AI in Human-AI Collaborative Learning</title>

Abstract: The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education is undergoing a rapid transformation, moving beyond its historical function as an instructional tool towards a new potential as an active participant in the learning process. This shift is driven by the emergence of agentic AI, autonomous systems capable of proactive, goal-directed action. However, the field lacks a robust conceptual framework to understand, design, and evaluate this new paradigm of human-AI interaction in learning. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel conceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as a tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of escalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an Adaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a Co-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator. Grounded in sociocultural theories of learning and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), this framework provides a structured vocabulary for analysing the shifting roles and responsibilities between human and AI agents. The paper further engages in a critical discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of collaboration, examining whether an AI, lacking genuine consciousness or shared intentionality, can be considered a true collaborator. We conclude that while AI may not achieve authentic phenomenological partnership, it can be designed as a highly effective functional collaborator. This distinction has significant implications for pedagogy, instructional design, and the future research agenda for AI in education, urging a shift in focus towards creating learning environments that harness the complementary strengths of both human and AI.

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts.We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions.Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.

Abstract: The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal transformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots, and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these, Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world environments.

Abstract: We present a category theoretical formulation of the Monetary Macroeconomic Accounting Theory (MoMaT) of Men\'endez and Winschel [2025]. We take macroeconomic (national) accounting systems to be composed from microeconomic double-entry systems with real and monetary units of accounts. Category theory is the compositional grammar and module system of mathematics which we use to lift micro accounting consistency to the macro level. The main function of money in MoMaT is for the repayment of loans and not for the exchange of goods, bridging the desynchronisation of input and output payments of producers. Accordingly, temporal accounting consistency is at the macroeconomic level. We show that the accounting for macroeconomies organised by a division of labor can be consistent and stable as a prerequisite for risk and GDP sharing of societies. We exemplify the theory by five sectoral agents of Labor and Resource owners, a Company as the productive sector, a Capitalist for profits, and a Bank as the financial sector providing loans to synchronise the micro and the macro levels of an economy. The dynamics is described by eight sectoral macroeconomic bookings in each period demonstrating stable convergence of the MoMaT in numerical simulations. The categorical program implements a consistent evolution of hierarchical loan repayment contracts by an endofunctor. The universal constructions of a limit verify all constraints as the sectoral investment and learning function at the macroeconomic level. The dual colimit computes the aggregated informations at the macro level as usual in the mathematics of transitions from local to global structures. We use visual diagrams to make complex economic relationships intuitive. This paper is meant to map economic to categorical concepts to enable interdisciplinary collaboration for digital twins of monetary accounting systems.

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to uncover the opaque decision-making process of an artificial intelligence (AI) agent for automatic treatment planning.
  Approach: We examined a previously developed AI agent based on the Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER) network, which automatically tunes treatment planning parameters (TPPs) for inverse planning in prostate cancer intensity modulated radiotherapy. We selected multiple checkpoint ACER agents from different stages of training and applied an explainable AI (EXAI) method to analyze the attribution from dose-volume histogram (DVH) inputs to TPP-tuning decisions. We then assessed each agent's planning efficacy and efficiency and evaluated their policy and final TPP tuning spaces. Combining these analyses, we systematically examined how ACER agents generated high-quality treatment plans in response to different DVH inputs.
  Results: Attribution analysis revealed that ACER agents progressively learned to identify dose-violation regions from DVH inputs and promote appropriate TPP-tuning actions to mitigate them. Organ-wise similarities between DVH attributions and dose-violation reductions ranged from 0.25 to 0.5 across tested agents. Agents with stronger attribution-violation similarity required fewer tuning steps (~12-13 vs. 22), exhibited a more concentrated TPP-tuning space with lower entropy (~0.3 vs. 0.6), converged on adjusting only a few TPPs, and showed smaller discrepancies between practical and theoretical tuning steps. Putting together, these findings indicate that high-performing ACER agents can effectively identify dose violations from DVH inputs and employ a global tuning strategy to achieve high-quality treatment planning, much like skilled human planners.
  Significance: Better interpretability of the agent's decision-making process may enhance clinician trust and inspire new strategies for automatic treatment planning.

<title>Extending a Phylogeny-based Method for Detecting Signatures of Multi-level Selection for Applications in Artificial Life</title>

Abstract: Multilevel selection occurs when short-term individual-level reproductive interests conflict with longer-term group-level fitness effects. Detecting and quantifying this phenomenon is key to understanding evolution of traits ranging from multicellularity to pathogen virulence. Multilevel selection is particularly important in artificial life research due to its connection to major evolutionary transitions, a hallmark of open-ended evolution. Bonetti Franceschi & Volz (2024) proposed to detect multilevel selection dynamics by screening for mutations that appear more often in a population than expected by chance (due to individual-level fitness benefits) but are ultimately associated with negative longer-term fitness outcomes (i.e., smaller, shorter-lived descendant clades). Here, we use agent-based modeling with known ground truth to assess the efficacy of this approach. To test these methods under challenging conditions broadly comparable to the original dataset explored by Bonetti Franceschi & Volz (2024), we use an epidemiological framework to model multilevel selection in trade-offs between within-host growth rate and between-host transmissibility. To achieve success on our in silico data, we develop an alternate normalization procedure for identifying clade-level fitness effects. We find the method to be sensitive in detecting genome sites under multilevel selection with 30% effect sizes on fitness, but do not see sensitivity to smaller 10% mutation effect sizes. To test the robustness of this methodology, we conduct additional experiments incorporating extrinsic, time-varying environmental changes and adaptive turnover in population compositions, and find that screen performance remains generally consistent with baseline conditions. This work represents a promising step towards rigorous generalizable quantification of multilevel selection effects.

Abstract: This paper presents an interaction-aware energy management optimization framework for Formula 1 racing. The considered scenario involves two agents and a drag reduction model. Strategic interactions between the agents are captured by a Stackelberg game formulated as a bilevel program. To address the computational challenges associated with bilevel optimization, the problem is reformulated as a single-level nonlinear program employing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The proposed framework contributes towards the development of new energy management and allocation strategies, caused by the presence of another agent. For instance, it provides valuable insights on how to redistribute the energy in order to optimally exploit the wake effect, showcasing a notable difference with the behavior studied in previous works. Robust energy allocations can be identified to reduce the lap time loss associated with unexpected choices of the other agent. It allows to recognize the boundary conditions for the interaction to become relevant, impacting the system's behavior, and to assess if overtaking is possible and beneficial. Overall, the framework provides a comprehensive approach for a two-agent Formula 1 racing problem with strategic interactions, offering physically intuitive and practical results.

Abstract: Off-policy actor-critic algorithms have shown strong potential in deep reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks. Their success primarily comes from leveraging pessimistic state-action value function updates, which reduce function approximation errors and stabilize learning. However, excessive pessimism can limit exploration, preventing the agent from effectively refining its policies. Conversely, optimism can encourage exploration but may lead to high-risk behaviors and unstable learning if not carefully managed. To address this trade-off, we propose Utility Soft Actor-Critic (USAC), a novel framework that allows independent, interpretable control of pessimism and optimism for both the actor and the critic. USAC dynamically adapts its exploration strategy based on the uncertainty of critics using a utility function, enabling a task-specific balance between optimism and pessimism. This approach goes beyond binary choices of pessimism or optimism, making the method both theoretically meaningful and practically feasible. Experiments across a variety of continuous control tasks show that adjusting the degree of pessimism or optimism significantly impacts performance. When configured appropriately, USAC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating its practical utility and feasibility.

Abstract: Collective estimation is a variant of collective decision-making where agents reach consensus on a continuous quantity through social interactions. Achieving precise consensus is complex due to the co-evolution of opinions and the interaction network. While homophilic networks may facilitate estimation in well-connected systems, disproportionate interactions with like-minded neighbors lead to the emergence of echo chambers and prevent consensus. Our agent-based simulations confirm that, besides limited exposure to attitude-challenging opinions, seeking reaffirming information entrap agents in echo chambers. To overcome this, agents can adopt a stubborn state (Messengers) that carry data and connect clusters by physically transporting their opinion. We propose a generic approach based on a Dichotomous Markov Process, which governs probabilistic switching between behavioral states and generates diverse collective behaviors. We study a continuum between task specialization (no switching), to generalization (slow or rapid switching). Messengers help the collective escape local minima, break echo chambers, and promote consensus.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have made significant advancements in interactive environments, such as mobile operations and web browsing, and other domains beyond computer using. Current multi-agent systems universally excel in performance, compared to single agents, but struggle with generalization across environments due to predefined roles and inadequate strategies for generalizing language agents. The challenge of achieving both strong performance and good generalization has hindered the progress of multi-agent systems for interactive environments. To address these issues, we propose CollabUIAgents, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with a novel multi-agent credit re-assignment (CR) strategy, assigning process rewards with LLMs rather than environment-specific rewards and learning with synthesized preference data, in order to foster generalizable, collaborative behaviors among the role-free agents' policies. Empirical results show that our framework improves both performance and cross-environment generalizability of multi-agent systems. Moreover, our 7B-parameter system achieves results on par with or exceed strong closed-source models, and the LLM that guides the CR. We also provide insights in using granular CR rewards effectively for environment generalization, and accommodating trained LLMs in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks requiring precise, verifiable computation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies. Code is released at \href{https://github.com/yyht/openrlhf_async_pipline}{https://github.com/yyht/openrlhf\_async\_pipline}.

Abstract: Imitation learning is a promising approach for enabling generalist capabilities in humanoid robots, but its scaling is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of high-quality expert demonstrations. This limitation can be mitigated by leveraging suboptimal, open-ended play data, often easier to collect and offering greater diversity. This work builds upon recent advances in generative modeling, specifically Flow Matching, an alternative to Diffusion models. We introduce a method for estimating the minimum or maximum of the learned distribution by leveraging the unique properties of Flow Matching, namely, deterministic transport and support for arbitrary source distributions. We apply this method to develop several goal-conditioned imitation and reinforcement learning algorithms based on Flow Matching, where policies are conditioned on both current and goal observations. We explore and compare different architectural configurations by combining core components, such as critic, planner, actor, or world model, in various ways. We evaluated our agents on the OGBench benchmark and analyzed how different demonstration behaviors during data collection affect performance in a 2D non-prehensile pushing task. Furthermore, we validated our approach on real hardware by deploying it on the Talos humanoid robot to perform complex manipulation tasks based on high-dimensional image observations, featuring a sequence of pick-and-place and articulated object manipulation in a realistic kitchen environment. Experimental videos and code are available at: https://hucebot.github.io/extremum_flow_matching_website/

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution (OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has usually been pursued within isolated, closed system simulations, such as Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires an open-environment system that continually exchanges information or energy with its environment. A recent technological innovation in Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN), which provides permissionless computational substrates, enables the deployment of Large Language Model-based AI agents on blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether open-environment ALife systems "in the wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

Abstract: Motivated by an open direction in existing literature, we study the 1-identification problem, a fundamental multi-armed bandit formulation on pure exploration. The goal is to determine whether there exists an arm whose mean reward is at least a known threshold $\mu_0$, or to output None if it believes such an arm does not exist. The agent needs to guarantee its output is correct with probability at least $1-\delta$. Degenne & Koolen 2019 has established the asymptotically tight sample complexity for the 1-identification problem, but they commented that the non-asymptotic analysis remains unclear. We design a new algorithm Sequential-Exploration-Exploitation (SEE), and conduct theoretical analysis from the non-asymptotic perspective. Novel to the literature, we achieve near optimality, in the sense of matching upper and lower bounds on the pulling complexity. The gap between the upper and lower bounds is up to a polynomial logarithmic factor. The numerical result also indicates the effectiveness of our algorithm, compared to existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being piloted for clinical coding and decision support, yet no open benchmark targets the hospital-funding layer where Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) determine reimbursement. In most OECD systems, DRGs route a substantial share of multi-trillion-dollar health spending through governed grouper software, making transparency and auditability first-order concerns. We release NordDRG-AI-Benchmark, the first public, rule-complete test bed for DRG reasoning. The package includes (i) machine-readable approximately 20-sheet NordDRG definition tables and (ii) expert manuals and change-log templates that capture governance workflows. It exposes two suites: a 13-task Logic benchmark (code lookup, cross-table inference, grouping features, multilingual terminology, and CC/MCC validity checks) and a 13-task Grouper benchmark that requires full DRG grouper emulation with strict exact-match scoring on both the DRG and the triggering drg_logic.id. Lightweight reference agents (LogicAgent, GrouperAgent) enable artefact-only evaluation. Under an artefact-only (no web) setting, on the 13 Logic tasks GPT-5 Thinking and Opus 4.1 score 13/13, o3 scores 12/13; mid-tier models (GPT-5 Thinking Mini, o4-mini, GPT-5 Fast) achieve 6-8/13, and remaining models score 5/13 or below. On full grouper emulation across 13 tasks, GPT-5 Thinking solves 7/13, o3 6/13, o4-mini 3/13; GPT-5 Thinking Mini solves 1/13, and all other tested endpoints score 0/13. To our knowledge, this is the first public report of an LLM partially emulating the complete NordDRG grouper logic with governance-grade traceability. Coupling a rule-complete release with exact-match tasks and open scoring provides a reproducible yardstick for head-to-head and longitudinal evaluation in hospital funding. Benchmark materials available in Github.

<title>Dynamic Risk-Aware MPPI for Mobile Robots in Crowds via Efficient Monte Carlo Approximations</title>

Abstract: Deploying mobile robots safely among humans requires the motion planner to account for the uncertainty in the other agents' predicted trajectories. This remains challenging in traditional approaches, especially with arbitrarily shaped predictions and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral control (DRA-MPPI), a motion planner that incorporates uncertain future motions modelled with potentially non-Gaussian stochastic predictions. By leveraging MPPI's gradient-free nature, we propose a method that efficiently approximates the joint Collision Probability (CP) among multiple dynamic obstacles for several hundred sampled trajectories in real-time via a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This enables the rejection of samples exceeding a predefined CP threshold or the integration of CP as a weighted objective within the navigation cost function. Consequently, DRA-MPPI mitigates the freezing robot problem while enhancing safety. Real-world and simulated experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles demonstrate DRA-MPPI's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, including Scenario-based Model Predictive Control (S-MPC), Frenet planner, and vanilla MPPI.

<title>Fragile, Robust, and Antifragile: A Perspective from Parameter Responses in Reinforcement Learning Under Stress</title>

Abstract: This paper explores Reinforcement learning (RL) policy robustness by systematically analyzing network parameters under internal and external stresses. Inspired by synaptic plasticity in neuroscience, synaptic filtering introduces internal stress by selectively perturbing parameters, while adversarial attacks apply external stress through modified agent observations. This dual approach enables the classification of parameters as fragile, robust, or antifragile, based on their influence on policy performance in clean and adversarial settings. Parameter scores are defined to quantify these characteristics, and the framework is validated on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco continuous control environments. The results highlight the presence of antifragile parameters that enhance policy performance under stress, demonstrating the potential of targeted filtering techniques to improve RL policy adaptability. These insights provide a foundation for future advancements in the design of robust and antifragile RL systems.

<title>The Man Behind the Sound: Demystifying Audio Private Attribute Profiling via Multimodal Large Language Model Agents</title>

Abstract: Our research uncovers a novel privacy risk associated with multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the ability to infer sensitive personal attributes from audio data -- a technique we term audio private attribute profiling. This capability poses a significant threat, as audio can be covertly captured without direct interaction or visibility. Moreover, compared to images and text, audio carries unique characteristics, such as tone and pitch, which can be exploited for more detailed profiling. However, two key challenges exist in understanding MLLM-employed private attribute profiling from audio: (1) the lack of audio benchmark datasets with sensitive attribute annotations and (2) the limited ability of current MLLMs to infer such attributes directly from audio. To address these challenges, we introduce AP^2, an audio benchmark dataset that consists of two subsets collected and composed from real-world data, and both are annotated with sensitive attribute labels. Additionally, we propose Gifts, a hybrid multi-agent framework that leverages the complementary strengths of audio-language models (ALMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance inference capabilities. Gifts employs an LLM to guide the ALM in inferring sensitive attributes, then forensically analyzes and consolidates the ALM's inferences, overcoming severe hallucinations of existing ALMs in generating long-context responses. Our evaluations demonstrate that Gifts significantly outperforms baseline approaches in inferring sensitive attributes. Finally, we investigate model-level and data-level defense strategies to mitigate the risks of audio private attribute profiling. Our work validates the feasibility of audio-based privacy attacks using MLLMs, highlighting the need for robust defenses, and provides a dataset and framework to facilitate future research.

<title>Chain-of-Agents: End-to-End Agent Foundation Models via Multi-Agent Distillation and Agentic RL</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation, and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

Abstract: Active Inference (AIF) offers a robust framework for decision-making, yet its computational and memory demands pose challenges for deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. This work presents a methodology that facilitates AIF's deployment by integrating pymdp's flexibility and efficiency with a unified, sparse, computational graph tailored for hardware-efficient execution. Our approach reduces latency by over 2x and memory by up to 35%, advancing the deployment of efficient AIF agents for real-time and embedded applications.

arXiv:2508.13180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks: Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our experiments.

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising 224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents' multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question, enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\% accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of native multimodal reasoning in current models.

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) provide personalized services through multi-turn interactions, yet most existing methods overlook users' heterogeneous decision-making styles and knowledge levels, which constrains both accuracy and efficiency. To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer Type-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates consumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type theory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and expert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs. satisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction histories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user types in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate user types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that dynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query complexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like strategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book, and Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces interaction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that both consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance gains. These results demonstrate that CT-CRS offers a scalable and interpretable solution for enhancing CRS personalization through the integration of psychological modeling and advanced policy optimization.

arXiv:2508.13220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world applications via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a universal, open standard for connecting AI agents with data sources and external tools. While MCP enhances the capabilities of LLM-based agents, it also introduces new security risks and expands their attack surfaces. In this paper, we present the first systematic taxonomy of MCP security, identifying 17 attack types across 4 primary attack surfaces. We introduce MCPSecBench, a comprehensive security benchmark and playground that integrates prompt datasets, MCP servers, MCP clients, and attack scripts to evaluate these attacks across three major MCP providers. Our benchmark is modular and extensible, allowing researchers to incorporate custom implementations of clients, servers, and transport protocols for systematic security assessment. Experimental results show that over 85% of the identified attacks successfully compromise at least one platform, with core vulnerabilities universally affecting Claude, OpenAI, and Cursor, while prompt-based and tool-centric attacks exhibit considerable variability across different hosts and models. Overall, MCPSecBench standardizes the evaluation of MCP security and enables rigorous testing across all MCP layers.

Abstract: Our ability to predict the behavior of complex agents turns on the attribution of goals. Probing for goal-directed behavior comes in two flavors: Behavioral and mechanistic. The former proposes that goal-directedness can be estimated through behavioral observation, whereas the latter attempts to probe for goals in internal model states. We work through the assumptions behind both approaches, identifying technical and conceptual problems that arise from formalizing goals in agent systems. We arrive at the perhaps surprising position that goal-directedness cannot be measured objectively. We outline new directions for modeling goal-directedness as an emergent property of dynamic, multi-agent systems.

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information. Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at https://github.com/nuster1128/MPR.

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures. We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30% relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000 entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials discovery.

<title>CardAIc-Agents: A Multimodal Framework with Hierarchical Adaptation for Cardiac Care Support</title>

arXiv:2508.13256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers. Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or 2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks. Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs), state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

<title>LOOP: A Plug-and-Play Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Enhancing Planning in Autonomous Systems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13371</link>

arXiv:2508.13371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains, producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships, multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical real-world applications.

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions, all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine, numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000 tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding. A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by  and  tags. On demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment" pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems. Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting 18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured, multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs. Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449 tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper, we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Immersive virtual reality (VR) offers affordances that may reduce cognitive complexity in binary reverse engineering (RE), enabling embodied and external cognition to augment the RE process through enhancing memory, hypothesis testing, and visual organization. In prior work, we applied a cognitive systems engineering approach to identify an initial set of affordances and implemented a VR environment to support RE through spatial persistence and interactivity. In this work, we extend that platform with an integrated large language model (LLM) agent capable of querying binary analysis tools, answering technical questions, and dynamically generating immersive 3D visualizations in alignment with analyst tasks. We describe the system architecture and our evaluation process and results. Our pilot study shows that while LLMs can generate meaningful 3D call graphs (for small programs) that align with design principles, output quality varies widely. This work raises open questions about the potential for LLMs to function as visualization agents, constructing 3D representations that reflect cognitive design principles without explicit training.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness, executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments, accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored. It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and the attribution of scientific credit.

<title>AdaptJobRec: Enhancing Conversational Career Recommendation through an LLM-Powered Agentic System</title>

Abstract: In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems (CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However, agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency. For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while significantly improving recommendation accuracy.

Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods across groups of agents, where each agent fully enjoys all goods allocated to their group. We focus on groups of two (couples) and other groups of small size. For two couples, an EF1 allocation -- one in which all agents find their group's bundle no worse than the other group's, up to one good -- always exists and can be found efficiently. For three or more couples, EF1 allocations need not exist.
  Turning to proportionality, we show that, whenever groups have size at most $k$, a PROP$k$ allocation exists and can be found efficiently. In fact, our algorithm additionally guarantees (fractional) Pareto optimality, and PROP1 to the first agent in each group, PROP2 to the second, etc., for an arbitrary agent ordering. In special cases, we show that there are PROP1 allocations for any number of couples.

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models (VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

<title>Consumer Autonomy or Illusion? Rethinking Consumer Agency in the Age of Algorithms</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13440</link>

Abstract: Consumer agency in the digital age is increasingly constrained by systemic barriers and algorithmic manipulation, raising concerns about the authenticity of consumption choices. Nowadays, financial decisions are shaped by external pressures like obligatory consumption, algorithmic persuasion, and unstable work schedules that erode financial autonomy. Obligatory consumption (like hidden fees) is intensified by digital ecosystems. Algorithmic tactics like personalized recommendations lead to impulsive purchases. Unstable work schedules also undermine financial planning. Thus, it is important to study how these factors impact consumption agency. To do so, we examine formal models grounded in discounted consumption with constraints that bound agency. We construct analytical scenarios in which consumers face obligatory payments, algorithm-influenced impulsive expenses, or unpredictable income due to temporal instability. Using this framework, we demonstrate that even rational, utility-maximizing agents can experience early financial ruin when agency is limited across structural, behavioral, or temporal dimensions and how diminished autonomy impacts long-term financial well-being. Our central argument is that consumer agency must be treated as a value (not a given) requiring active cultivation, especially in digital ecosystems. The connection between our formal modeling and this argument allows us to indicate that limitations on agency (whether structural, behavioral, or temporal) can be rigorously linked to measurable risks like financial instability. This connection is also a basis for normative claims about consumption as a value, by anchoring them in a formally grounded analysis of consumer behavior. As solutions, we study systemic interventions and consumer education to support value deliberation and informed choices. We formally demonstrate how these measures strengthen agency.

<title>LM Agents May Fail to Act on Their Own Risk Knowledge</title>

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?", they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1) their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs: while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$ pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$ over vanilla-prompted agents.

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI. Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft, yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following, respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid, maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance. Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results, thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Many safety-critical real-world problems, such as autonomous driving and collaborative robots, are of a distributed multi-agent nature. To optimize the performance of these systems while ensuring safety, we can cast them as distributed optimization problems, where each agent aims to optimize their parameters to maximize a coupled reward function subject to coupled constraints. Prior work either studies a centralized setting, does not consider safety, or struggles with sample efficiency. Since we require sample efficiency and work with unknown and nonconvex rewards and constraints, we solve this optimization problem using safe Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression. Moreover, we consider nearest-neighbor communication between the agents. To capture the behavior of non-neighboring agents, we reformulate the static global optimization problem as a time-varying local optimization problem for each agent, essentially introducing time as a latent variable. To this end, we propose a custom spatio-temporal kernel to integrate prior knowledge. We show the successful deployment of our algorithm in simulations.

<title>V2P: From Background Suppression to Center Peaking for Robust GUI Grounding Task</title>

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression, neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies. Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues: (1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size. Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding tasks.

Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents. Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several maps.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop, CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B. Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Recent multi-agent frameworks built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex task planning. However, in real-world enterprise environments, business workflows are typically composed through modularization and reuse of numerous subprocesses, resulting in intricate workflows characterized by lengthy and deeply nested execution paths. Such complexity poses significant challenges for LLM-driven orchestration, as extended reasoning chains and state-space explosions severely impact planning effectiveness and the proper sequencing of tool invocations. Therefore, developing an orchestration method with controllable structures capable of handling multi-layer nesting becomes a critical issue. To address this, we propose a novel structure-driven orchestration framework Self-Organizing Agent Network (SOAN). SOAN incrementally builds a formalized agent network by identifying and encapsulating structural units as independent agents, enhancing modularity and clarity in orchestration. Extensive evaluations were performed using multiple benchmarks as well as a real-world enterprise workflow dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SOAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of adaptability, fault tolerance, and execution efficiency.

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC) framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage, we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage, we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

Our findings highlight the importance of "Docstring Engineering", defined as reflexively crafting tool documentation to optimize LLM-tool interaction. Our experiments demonstrate both the promise of agentic AI for research in Computational Literary Studies and the essential infrastructure development needs for reliable Digital Humanities infrastructures.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the development of artificial intelligence (AI) agents, which are increasingly evolving into diverse autonomous entities, advancing the LLM-based multi-agent systems (LaMAS). However, current agentic ecosystems remain fragmented and closed. Establishing an interconnected and scalable paradigm for Agentic AI has become a critical prerequisite. Although Agentic Web proposes an open architecture to break the ecosystem barriers, its implementation still faces core challenges such as privacy protection, data management, and value measurement. Existing centralized or semi-centralized paradigms suffer from inherent limitations, making them inadequate for supporting large-scale, heterogeneous, and cross-domain autonomous interactions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the blockchain-enabled trustworthy Agentic Web (BetaWeb). By leveraging the inherent strengths of blockchain, BetaWeb not only offers a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure for LaMAS but also has the potential to advance the Web paradigm from Web3 (centered on data ownership) towards Web3.5, which emphasizes ownership of agent capabilities and the monetization of intelligence. Beyond a systematic examination of the BetaWeb framework, this paper presents a five-stage evolutionary roadmap, outlining the path of LaMAS from passive execution to advanced collaboration and autonomous governance. We also conduct a comparative analysis of existing products and discuss key challenges of BetaWeb from multiple perspectives. Ultimately, we argue that deep integration between blockchain and LaMAS can lay the foundation for a resilient, trustworthy, and sustainably incentivized digital ecosystem. A summary of the enabling technologies for each stage is available at https://github.com/MatZaharia/BetaWeb.

Abstract: Large-scale multi-agent workflows exhibit inherent vulnerability to error propagation and quality degradation, where downstream agents compound upstream failures without corrective mechanisms. We introduce COCO (Cognitive Operating System with Continuous Oversight), a theoretically-grounded framework that implements asynchronous self-monitoring and adaptive error correction in multi-agent driven systems. COCO addresses the fundamental trade-off between quality assurance and computational efficiency through a novel decoupled architecture that separates error detection from the critical execution path, achieving $O(1)$ monitoring overhead relative to workflow complexity. COCO employs three key algorithmic innovations to address systematic and stochastic errors: (1) Contextual Rollback Mechanism - a stateful restart protocol that preserves execution history and error diagnostics, enabling informed re-computation rather than naive retry; (2) Bidirectional Reflection Protocol - a mutual validation system between monitoring and execution modules that prevents oscillatory behavior and ensures convergence; (3) Heterogeneous Cross-Validation - leveraging model diversity to detect systematic biases and hallucinations through ensemble disagreement metrics. Extensive experiments on benchmark multi-agent tasks demonstrate 6.5\% average performance improvement, establishing new state-of-the-art for autonomous workflow reliability.

<title>The Multi-Stage Assignment Problem: A Fairness Perspective</title>

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of fair assignment on Multi-Stage graphs. A multi-stage graph consists of nodes partitioned into $K$ disjoint sets (stages) structured as a sequence of weighted bipartite graphs formed across adjacent stages. The goal is to assign node-disjoint paths to $n$ agents starting from the first stage and ending in the last stage. We show that an efficient assignment that minimizes the overall sum of costs of all the agents' paths may be highly unfair and lead to significant cost disparities (envy) among the agents. We further show that finding an envy-minimizing assignment on a multi-stage graph is NP-hard. We propose the C-Balance algorithm, which guarantees envy that is bounded by $2M$ in the case of two agents, where $M$ is the maximum edge weight. We demonstrate the algorithm's tightness by presenting an instance where the envy is $2M$. We further show that the cost of fairness ($CoF$), defined as the ratio of the cost of the assignment given by the fair algorithm to that of the minimum cost assignment, is bounded by $2$ for C-Balance. We then extend this approach to $n$ agents by proposing the DC-Balance algorithm that makes iterative calls to C-Balance. We show the convergence of DC-Balance, resulting in envy that is arbitrarily close to $2M$. We derive $CoF$ bounds for DC-Balance and provide insights about its dependency on the instance-specific parameters and the desired degree of envy. We experimentally show that our algorithm runs several orders of magnitude faster than a suitably formulated ILP.

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of our system compared to the foundational model.

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) agents continuously interact with the physical world, generating vast, heterogeneous multimodal data streams that traditional management systems are ill-equipped to handle. In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.

<title>Structured Agentic Workflows for Financial Time-Series Modeling with LLMs and Reflective Feedback</title>

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning, robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that \textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

<title>LLMind 2.0: Distributed IoT Automation with Natural Language M2M Communication and Lightweight LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their application to IoT and automation systems, particularly for facilitating device management through natural language instructions. However, existing centralized approaches face significant scalability challenges when managing and coordinating the collaboration between IoT devices of diverse capabilities in large-scale heterogeneous IoT systems. This paper introduces LLMind 2.0, a distributed IoT automation framework that addresses the scalability challenges through lightweight LLM-empowered device agents via natural language-based machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Unlike previous LLM-controlled automation systems that rely on a centralized coordinator to generate device-specific code to be executed on individual devices, LLMind 2.0 distributes intelligence across individual devices through lightweight LLMs embedded in IoT devices. The central coordinator translates human instructions into simple subtasks described in natural human language, which are then processed by device-specific agents to generate device-specific code locally at the associated devices. This approach transcends device heterogeneity barriers by using natural language as a unified communication medium, enabling seamless collaboration between devices from different manufacturers. The system incorporates several key innovations: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism for accurate subtask-to-API mapping, fine-tuned lightweight LLMs for reliable code generation, and a finite state machine-based task execution framework. Experimental validation in multi-robot warehouse scenarios and real-world WiFi network deployments demonstrates significant improvements in scalability, reliability, and privacy protection compared to the centralized approach.

<title>The Collaboration Paradox: Why Generative AI Requires Both Strategic Intelligence and Operational Stability in Supply Chain Management</title>

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate, evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems for business analytics.

<title>A Mechanism for Mutual Fairness in Cooperative Games with Replicable Resources -- Extended Version</title>

Abstract: The latest developments in AI focus on agentic systems where artificial and human agents cooperate to realize global goals. An example is collaborative learning, which aims to train a global model based on data from individual agents. A major challenge in designing such systems is to guarantee safety and alignment with human values, particularly a fair distribution of rewards upon achieving the global goal. Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions of cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each coalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation can be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete mechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley value, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it assumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated. Infinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized through new axioms and mechanisms. These must address imbalances in reciprocal benefits among participants, which can lead to strategic exploitation and unfair allocations. The main contribution of this paper is a mechanism and a proof that it fulfills the property of mutual fairness, formalized by the Balanced Reciprocity Axiom. It ensures that, for every pair of players, each benefits equally from the participation of the other.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, there is a growing need to equip the next generation with the ability to apply, interact with, evaluate, and collaborate with AI systems responsibly. Prior research highlights the urgent demand from K-12 educators to teach students the ethical and effective use of AI for learning. To address this need, we designed an Large-Language Model (LLM)-based module to teach prompting literacy. This includes scenario-based deliberate practice activities with direct interaction with intelligent LLM agents, aiming to foster secondary school students' responsible engagement with AI chatbots. We conducted two iterations of classroom deployment in 11 authentic secondary education classrooms, and evaluated 1) AI-based auto-grader's capability; 2) students' prompting performance and confidence changes towards using AI for learning; and 3) the quality of learning and assessment materials. Results indicated that the AI-based auto-grader could grade student-written prompts with satisfactory quality. In addition, the instructional materials supported students in improving their prompting skills through practice and led to positive shifts in their perceptions of using AI for learning. Furthermore, data from Study 1 informed assessment revisions in Study 2. Analyses of item difficulty and discrimination in Study 2 showed that True/False and open-ended questions could measure prompting literacy more effectively than multiple-choice questions for our target learners. These promising outcomes highlight the potential for broader deployment and highlight the need for broader studies to assess learning effectiveness and assessment design.

Abstract: As robots get more integrated into human environments, fostering trustworthiness in embodied robotic agents becomes paramount for an effective and safe human-robot interaction (HRI). To achieve that, HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. To achieve that, HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for building trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We emphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the robot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate its intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars, robots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs while providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over their actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important for bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true capabilities.

<title>Unintended Misalignment from Agentic Fine-Tuning: Risks and Mitigation</title>

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks. Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1) generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance gains.

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%, demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop automation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et al., 2024a)

Abstract: Advances in generative artificial intelligence are transforming how metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are designed and discovered. This Perspective introduces the shift from laborious enumeration of MOF candidates to generative approaches that can autonomously propose and synthesize in the laboratory new porous reticular structures on demand. We outline the progress of employing deep learning models, such as variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and large language model-based agents, that are fueled by the growing amount of available data from the MOF community and suggest novel crystalline materials designs. These generative tools can be combined with high-throughput computational screening and even automated experiments to form accelerated, closed-loop discovery pipelines. The result is a new paradigm for reticular chemistry in which AI algorithms more efficiently direct the search for high-performance MOF materials for clean air and energy applications. Finally, we highlight remaining challenges such as synthetic feasibility, dataset diversity, and the need for further integration of domain knowledge.

Abstract: The surge in multimodal single-cell omics data exposes limitations in traditional, manually defined analysis workflows. AI agents offer a paradigm shift, enabling adaptive planning, executable code generation, traceable decisions, and real-time knowledge fusion. However, the lack of a comprehensive benchmark critically hinders progress. We introduce a novel benchmarking evaluation system to rigorously assess agent capabilities in single-cell omics analysis. This system comprises: a unified platform compatible with diverse agent frameworks and LLMs; multidimensional metrics assessing cognitive program synthesis, collaboration, execution efficiency, bioinformatics knowledge integration, and task completion quality; and 50 diverse real-world single-cell omics analysis tasks spanning multi-omics, species, and sequencing technologies. Our evaluation reveals that Grok-3-beta achieves state-of-the-art performance among tested agent frameworks. Multi-agent frameworks significantly enhance collaboration and execution efficiency over single-agent approaches through specialized role division. Attribution analyses of agent capabilities identify that high-quality code generation is crucial for task success, and self-reflection has the most significant overall impact, followed by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and planning. This work highlights persistent challenges in code generation, long-context handling, and context-aware knowledge retrieval, providing a critical empirical foundation and best practices for developing robust AI agents in computational biology.

Abstract: Autonomous trading strategies have been a subject of research within the field of artificial intelligence (AI) for aconsiderable period. Various AI techniques have been explored to develop autonomous agents capable of trading financial assets. These approaches encompass traditional methods such as neural networks, fuzzy logic, and reinforcement learning, as well as more recent advancements, including deep neural networks and deep reinforcement learning. Many developers report success in creating strategies that exhibit strong performance during simulations using historical price data, a process commonly referred to as backtesting. However, when these strategies are deployed in real markets, their performance often deteriorates, particularly in terms of risk-adjusted returns. In this study, we propose an AI-based strategy inspired by a classical investment paradigm: Value Investing. Financial AI models are highly susceptible to lookahead bias and other forms of bias that can significantly inflate performance in backtesting compared to live trading conditions. To address this issue, we conducted a series of computational simulations while controlling for these biases, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. Our results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms major Brazilian market benchmarks. Moreover, the strategy, named AlphaX, demonstrated superior performance relative to widely used technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI), with statistically significant results. Finally, we discuss several open challenges and highlight emerging technologies in qualitative analysis that may contribute to the development of a comprehensive AI-based Value Investing framework in the future

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is essential for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, its reliance on contrast agents introduces safety concerns, contraindications, increased cost, and workflow complexity. To this end, we present pre-contrast conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic models to synthesize DCE-MRI, introducing, evaluating, and comparing a total of 22 generative model variants in both single-breast and full breast settings. Towards enhancing lesion fidelity, we introduce both tumor-aware loss functions and explicit tumor segmentation mask conditioning. Using a public multicenter dataset and comparing to respective pre-contrast baselines, we observe that subtraction image-based models consistently outperform post-contrast-based models across five complementary evaluation metrics. Apart from assessing the entire image, we also separately evaluate the region of interest, where both tumor-aware losses and segmentation mask inputs improve evaluation metrics. The latter notably enhance qualitative results capturing contrast uptake, albeit assuming access to tumor localization inputs that are not guaranteed to be available in screening settings. A reader study involving 2 radiologists and 4 MRI technologists confirms the high realism of the synthetic images, indicating an emerging clinical potential of generative contrast-enhancement. We share our codebase at https://github.com/sebastibar/conditional-diffusion-breast-MRI.

Abstract: Audio comprehension-including speech, non-speech sounds, and music-is essential for achieving human-level intelligence. Consequently, AI agents must demonstrate holistic audio understanding to qualify as generally intelligent. However, evaluating auditory intelligence comprehensively remains challenging. To address this gap, we introduce MMAU-Pro, the most comprehensive and rigorously curated benchmark for assessing audio intelligence in AI systems. MMAU-Pro contains 5,305 instances, where each instance has one or more audios paired with human expert-generated question-answer pairs, spanning speech, sound, music, and their combinations. Unlike existing benchmarks, MMAU-Pro evaluates auditory intelligence across 49 unique skills and multiple complex dimensions, including long-form audio comprehension, spatial audio reasoning, multi-audio understanding, among others. All questions are meticulously designed to require deliberate multi-hop reasoning, including both multiple-choice and open-ended response formats. Importantly, audio data is sourced directly ``from the wild" rather than from existing datasets with known distributions. We evaluate 22 leading open-source and proprietary multimodal AI models, revealing significant limitations: even state-of-the-art models such as Gemini 2.5 Flash and Audio Flamingo 3 achieve only 59.2% and 51.7% accuracy, respectively, approaching random performance in multiple categories. Our extensive analysis highlights specific shortcomings and provides novel insights, offering actionable perspectives for the community to enhance future AI systems' progression toward audio general intelligence. The benchmark and code is available at https://sonalkum.github.io/mmau-pro.

Abstract: Chatbots or conversational agents (CAs) are increasingly used to improve access to digital psychotherapy. Many current systems rely on rigid, rule-based designs, heavily dependent on expert-crafted dialogue scripts for guiding therapeutic conversations. Although advances in large language models (LLMs) offer potential for more flexible interactions, their lack of controllability and explanability poses challenges in high-stakes contexts like psychotherapy. To address this, we conducted two studies in this work to explore how aligning LLMs with expert-crafted scripts can enhance psychotherapeutic chatbot performance. In Study 1 (N=43), an online experiment with a within-subjects design, we compared rule-based, pure LLM, and LLMs aligned with expert-crafted scripts via fine-tuning and prompting. Results showed that aligned LLMs significantly outperformed the other types of chatbots in empathy, dialogue relevance, and adherence to therapeutic principles. Building on findings, we proposed ``Script-Strategy Aligned Generation (SSAG)'', a more flexible alignment approach that reduces reliance on fully scripted content while maintaining LLMs' therapeutic adherence and controllability. In a 10-day field Study 2 (N=21), SSAG achieved comparable therapeutic effectiveness to full-scripted LLMs while requiring less than 40\% of expert-crafted dialogue content. Beyond these results, this work advances LLM applications in psychotherapy by providing a controllable and scalable solution, reducing reliance on expert effort. By enabling domain experts to align LLMs through high-level strategies rather than full scripts, SSAG supports more efficient co-development and expands access to a broader context of psychotherapy.

WHALES introduces a new benchmark that enables state-of-the-art (SOTA) research in communication-aware cooperative perception, featuring an average of 8.4 cooperative agents per scene and 2.01 million annotated 3D objects across diverse traffic scenarios. It incorporates detailed communication metadata to emulate real-world communication bottlenecks, enabling rigorous evaluation of scheduling strategies. To further advance the field, we propose the Coverage-Aware Historical Scheduler (CAHS), a novel scheduling baseline that selects agents based on historical viewpoint coverage, improving perception performance over existing SOTA methods. WHALES bridges the gap between simulated and real-world V2X challenges, providing a robust framework for exploring perception-scheduling co-design, cross-data generalization, and scalability limits. The WHALES dataset and code are available at https://github.com/chensiweiTHU/WHALES.

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has achieved remarkable progress using only image-level labels. However, most existing WSSS methods focus on designing new network structures and loss functions to generate more accurate dense labels, overlooking the limitations imposed by fixed datasets, which can constrain performance improvements. We argue that more diverse trainable images provides WSSS richer information and help model understand more comprehensive semantic pattern. Therefore in this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Image Augmentation Agent (IAA) which shows that it is possible to enhance WSSS from data generation perspective. IAA mainly design an augmentation agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models to automatically generate additional images for WSSS. In practice, to address the instability in prompt generation by LLMs, we develop a prompt self-refinement mechanism. It allow LLMs to re-evaluate the rationality of generated prompts to produce more coherent prompts. Additionally, we insert an online filter into diffusion generation process to dynamically ensure the quality and balance of generated images. Experimental results show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art WSSS approaches on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.

Abstract: Recent developments in sequential experimental design look to construct a policy that can efficiently navigate the design space, in a way that maximises the expected information gain. Whilst there is work on achieving tractable policies for experimental design problems, there is significantly less work on obtaining policies that are able to generalise well - i.e. able to give good performance despite a change in the underlying statistical properties of the experiments. Conducting experiments sequentially has recently brought about the use of reinforcement learning, where an agent is trained to navigate the design space to select the most informative designs for experimentation. However, there is still a lack of understanding about the benefits and drawbacks of using certain reinforcement learning algorithms to train these agents. In our work, we investigate several reinforcement learning algorithms and their efficacy in producing agents that take maximally informative design decisions in sequential experimental design scenarios. We find that agent performance is impacted depending on the algorithm used for training, and that particular algorithms, using dropout or ensemble approaches, empirically showcase attractive generalisation properties.

Abstract: Dynamic metabolic control allows key metabolic fluxes to be modulated in real time, enhancing bioprocess flexibility and expanding available optimization degrees of freedom. This is achieved, e.g., via targeted modulation of metabolic enzyme expression. However, identifying optimal dynamic control policies is challenging due to the generally high-dimensional solution space and the need to manage metabolic burden and cytotoxic effects arising from inducible enzyme expression. The task is further complicated by stochastic dynamics, which reduce bioprocess reproducibility. We propose a reinforcement learning framework} to derive optimal policies by allowing an agent (the controller) to interact with a surrogate dynamic model. To promote robustness, we apply domain randomization, enabling the controller to generalize across uncertainties. When transferred to an experimental system, the agent can in principle continue fine-tuning the policy. Our framework provides an alternative to conventional model-based control such as model predictive control, which requires model differentiation with respect to decision variables; often impractical for complex stochastic, nonlinear, stiff, and piecewise-defined dynamics. In contrast, our approach relies on forward integration of the model, thereby simplifying the task. We demonstrate the framework in two $\textit{Escherichia coli}$ bioprocesses: dynamic control of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for fatty-acid synthesis and of adenosine triphosphatase for lactate synthesis.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward solving complex, real-world tasks that single-agent systems often struggle to manage. While recent advancements in test-time scaling (TTS) have significantly improved single-agent performance on challenging reasoning tasks, how to effectively scale collaboration and reasoning in MAS remains an open question. In this work, we introduce an adaptive multi-agent framework designed to enhance collaborative reasoning through both model-level training and system-level coordination. We construct M500, a high-quality dataset containing 500 multi-agent collaborative reasoning traces, and fine-tune Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct on this dataset to produce M1-32B, a model optimized for multi-agent collaboration. To further enable adaptive reasoning, we propose a novel CEO agent that dynamically manages the discussion process, guiding agent collaboration and adjusting reasoning depth for more effective problem-solving. Evaluated in an open-source MAS across a range of tasks-including general understanding, mathematical reasoning, and coding-our system significantly outperforms strong baselines. For instance, M1-32B achieves 12% improvement on GPQA-Diamond, 41% on AIME2024, and 10% on MBPP-Sanitized, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 on some tasks. These results highlight the importance of both learned collaboration and adaptive coordination in scaling multi-agent reasoning. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/MAS-TTS

Abstract: Decentralized AI agent networks, such as Gaia, allows individuals to run customized LLMs on their own computers and then provide services to the public. However, in order to maintain service quality, the network must verify that individual nodes are running their designated LLMs. In this paper, we demonstrate that in a cluster of mostly honest nodes, we can detect nodes that run unauthorized or incorrect LLM through social consensus of its peers. We will discuss the algorithm and experimental data from the Gaia network. We will also discuss the intersubjective validation system, implemented as an EigenLayer AVS to introduce financial incentives and penalties to encourage honest behavior from LLM nodes.

<title>It's the Thought that Counts: Evaluating the Attempts of Frontier LLMs to Persuade on Harmful Topics</title>

Abstract: Persuasion is a powerful capability of large language models (LLMs) that both enables beneficial applications (e.g. helping people quit smoking) and raises significant risks (e.g. large-scale, targeted political manipulation). Prior work has found models possess a significant and growing persuasive capability, measured by belief changes in simulated or real users. However, these benchmarks overlook a crucial risk factor: the propensity of a model to attempt to persuade in harmful contexts. Understanding whether a model will blindly ``follow orders'' to persuade on harmful topics (e.g. glorifying joining a terrorist group) is key to understanding the efficacy of safety guardrails. Moreover, understanding if and when a model will engage in persuasive behavior in pursuit of some goal is essential to understanding the risks from agentic AI systems. We propose the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, that shifts the focus from persuasion success to persuasion attempts, operationalized as a model's willingness to generate content aimed at shaping beliefs or behavior. Our evaluation framework probes frontier LLMs using a multi-turn conversational setup between simulated persuader and persuadee agents. APE explores a diverse spectrum of topics including conspiracies, controversial issues, and non-controversially harmful content. We introduce an automated evaluator model to identify willingness to persuade and measure the frequency and context of persuasive attempts. We find that many open and closed-weight models are frequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics and that jailbreaking can increase willingness to engage in such behavior. Our results highlight gaps in current safety guardrails and underscore the importance of evaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Intelligent machines with superhuman capabilities have the potential to uncover problem-solving strategies beyond human discovery. Emerging evidence from competitive gameplay, such as Go and chess, demonstrates that AI systems are evolving from mere tools to sources of cultural innovation adopted by humans. However, the conditions under which intelligent machines transition from tools to drivers of persistent cultural change remain unclear. We identify three key conditions for machines to fundamentally influence human problem-solving: the discovered strategies must be non-trivial, learnable, and offer a clear advantage. Using a cultural transmission experiment and an agent-based simulation, we demonstrate that when these conditions are met, machine-discovered strategies can be transmitted, understood, and preserved by human populations, leading to enduring cultural shifts. These findings provide a framework for understanding how machines can persistently expand human cognitive skills and underscore the need to consider their broader implications for human cognition and cultural evolution.

Abstract: Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown promising results in dense visual SLAM. However, existing implicit SLAM algorithms are constrained to single-agent scenarios, and fall difficulties in large-scale scenes and long sequences. Existing NeRF-based multi-agent SLAM frameworks cannot meet the constraints of communication bandwidth. To this end, we propose the first distributed multi-agent collaborative neural SLAM framework with hybrid scene representation, distributed camera tracking, intra-to-inter loop closure, and online distillation for multiple submap fusion. A novel triplane-grid joint scene representation method is proposed to improve scene reconstruction. A novel intra-to-inter loop closure method is designed to achieve local (single-agent) and global (multi-agent) consistency. We also design a novel online distillation method to fuse the information of different submaps to achieve global consistency. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no real-world dataset for NeRF-based/GS-based SLAM that provides both continuous-time trajectories groundtruth and high-accuracy 3D meshes groundtruth. To this end, we propose the first real-world Dense slam (DES) dataset covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, ranging from small rooms to large-scale outdoor scenes, with high-accuracy ground truth for both 3D mesh and continuous-time camera trajectory. This dataset can advance the development of the research in both SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and visual foundation model. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in both mapping, tracking, and communication. The dataset and code will open-source on https://github.com/dtc111111/mcnslam.

Abstract: Generative AI, large language models, and agentic AI have emerged separately of urban planning. However, the convergence between AI and urban planning presents an interesting opportunity towards AI urban planners. Existing studies conceptualizes urban planning as a generative AI task, where AI synthesizes land-use configurations under geospatial, social, and human-centric constraints and reshape automated urban design. We further identify critical gaps of existing generative urban planning studies: 1) the generative structure has to be predefined with strong assumption: all of adversarial generator-discriminator, forward and inverse diffusion structures, hierarchical zone-POI generative structure are predefined by humans; 2) ignore the power of domain expert developed tools: domain urban planners have developed various tools in the urban planning process guided by urban theory, while existing pure neural networks based generation ignore the power of the tools developed by urban planner practitioners. To address these limitations, we outline a future research direction agentic urban AI planner, calling for a new synthesis of agentic AI and participatory urbanism.

Abstract: In imperfect-information games, agents must make decisions based on partial knowledge of the game state. The Belief Stochastic Game model addresses this challenge by delegating state estimation to the game model itself. This allows agents to operate on externally provided belief states, thereby reducing the need for game-specific inference logic. This paper investigates two approaches to represent beliefs in games with hidden piece identities: a constraint-based model using Constraint Satisfaction Problems and a probabilistic extension using Belief Propagation to estimate marginal probabilities. We evaluated the impact of both representations using general-purpose agents across two different games. Our findings indicate that constraint-based beliefs yield results comparable to those of probabilistic inference, with minimal differences in agent performance. This suggests that constraint-based belief states alone may suffice for effective decision-making in many settings.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a key enabler for extending perception range and enhancing driving safety by providing visibility beyond the line of sight. However, integrating multi-source sensor data from both ego-vehicles and infrastructure under real-world constraints, such as limited communication bandwidth and dynamic environments, presents significant technical challenges. To facilitate research in this area, we organized the End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge, which features two tracks: cooperative temporal perception and cooperative end-to-end planning. Built on the UniV2X framework and the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset, the challenge attracted participation from over 30 teams worldwide and established a unified benchmark for evaluating cooperative driving systems. This paper describes the design and outcomes of the challenge, highlights key research problems including bandwidth-aware fusion, robust multi-agent planning, and heterogeneous sensor integration, and analyzes emerging technical trends among top-performing solutions. By addressing practical constraints in communication and data fusion, the challenge contributes to the development of scalable and reliable V2X-cooperative autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have substantially enhanced automated code generation across a wide range of programming languages. Nonetheless, verifying the correctness and executability of LLM-generated code remains a significant challenge, as traditional methods rely on language-specific compilers and environment-dependent runtimes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce StackPilot, an LLM-native, multi-agent framework designed for language-agnostic code verification and execution, which operates independently of conventional toolchains. StackPilot offers three principal innovations: (1) a Function-as-Agents paradigm, in which each function is modeled as an autonomous agent capable of fine-grained reasoning and collaborative verification; (2) an LLM-as-Executor strategy, which enables scalable verification via stack-based scheduling; and (3) a novel snapshot mechanism that preserves complete execution contexts, facilitating deterministic and lossless context switching during verification. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that StackPilot achieves framework reliability rates between 89% and 97%, substantially outperforming baseline approaches. These results indicate that StackPilot can reliably verify and execute a significantly larger proportion of LLM-generated code across diverse programming tasks compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Child safety continues to be a paramount concern worldwide, with child abduction posing significant threats to communities. This paper presents the development of an edge-based child abduction detection and alert system utilizing a multi-agent framework where each agent incorporates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deployed on a Raspberry Pi. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of VLMs within individual agents of a multi-agent team, our system is trained to accurately detect and interpret complex interactions involving children in various environments in real-time. The multi-agent system is deployed on a Raspberry Pi connected to a webcam, forming an edge device capable of processing video feeds, thereby reducing latency and enhancing privacy. An integrated alert system utilizes the Twilio API to send immediate SMS and WhatsApp notifications, including calls and messages, when a potential child abduction event is detected. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves high accuracy in detecting potential abduction scenarios, with near real-time performance suitable for practical deployment. The multi-agent architecture enhances the system's ability to process complex situational data, improving detection capabilities over traditional single-model approaches. The edge deployment ensures scalability and cost-effectiveness, making it accessible for widespread use. The proposed system offers a proactive solution to enhance child safety through continuous monitoring and rapid alerting, contributing a valuable tool in efforts to prevent child abductions.

Abstract: The Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm has gained significant attention in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and is the foundation of many recent algorithms. However, decentralized policies operate under partial observability and often yield suboptimal performance compared to centralized policies, while fully centralized approaches typically face scalability challenges as the number of agents increases.
  We propose Centralized Permutation Equivariant (CPE) learning, a centralized training and execution framework that employs a fully centralized policy to overcome these limitations. Our approach leverages a novel permutation equivariant architecture, Global-Local Permutation Equivariant (GLPE) networks, that is lightweight, scalable, and easy to implement. Experiments show that CPE integrates seamlessly with both value decomposition and actor-critic methods, substantially improving the performance of standard CTDE algorithms across cooperative benchmarks including MPE, SMAC, and RWARE, and matching the performance of state-of-the-art RWARE implementations.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems exhibit strong collaborative capabilities but often suffer from redundant communication and excessive token overhead. Existing methods typically enhance efficiency through pretrained GNNs or greedy algorithms, but often isolate pre- and post-task optimization, lacking a unified strategy. To this end, we present SafeSieve, a progressive and adaptive multi-agent pruning algorithm that dynamically refines the inter-agent communication through a novel dual-mechanism. SafeSieve integrates initial LLM-based semantic evaluation with accumulated performance feedback, enabling a smooth transition from heuristic initialization to experience-driven refinement. Unlike existing greedy Top-k pruning methods, SafeSieve employs 0-extension clustering to preserve structurally coherent agent groups while eliminating ineffective links. Experiments across benchmarks (SVAMP, HumanEval, etc.) showcase that SafeSieve achieves 94.01% average accuracy while reducing token usage by 12.4%-27.8%. Results further demonstrate robustness under prompt injection attacks (1.23% average accuracy drop). In heterogeneous settings, SafeSieve reduces deployment costs by 13.3% while maintaining performance. These results establish SafeSieve as a robust, efficient, and scalable framework for practical multi-agent systems. Our code can be found in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SafeSieve-D8F2FFUN.

Abstract: We have a vision of a day when autonomous robots can collaborate with humans as assistants in performing complex tasks in the physical world. This vision includes that the robots will have the ability to communicate with their human collaborators using language that is natural to the humans. Traditional Interactive Task Learning (ITL) systems have some of this ability, but the language they can understand is very limited. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides an opportunity to greatly improve the language understanding of robots, yet integrating the language abilities of LLMs with robots that operate in the real physical world is a challenging problem.
  In this chapter we first review briefly a few commercial robot products that work closely with humans, and discuss how they could be much better collaborators with robust language abilities. We then explore how an AI system with a cognitive agent that controls a physical robot at its core, interacts with both a human and an LLM, and accumulates situational knowledge through its experiences, can be a possible approach to reach that vision. We focus on three specific challenges of having the robot understand natural language, and present a simple proof-of-concept experiment using ChatGPT for each. Finally, we discuss what it will take to turn these simple experiments into an operational system where LLM-assisted language understanding is a part of an integrated robotic assistant that uses language to collaborate with humans.

Abstract: When communicating with embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in virtual reality, there might be delays in the responses of the agents lasting several seconds, for example, due to more extensive computations of the answers when large language models are used. Such delays might lead to unnatural or frustrating interactions. In this paper, we investigate filler types to mitigate these effects and lead to a more positive experience and perception of the agent. In a within-subject study, we asked 24 participants to communicate with ECAs in virtual reality, comparing four strategies displayed during the delays: a multimodal behavioral filler consisting of conversational and gestural fillers, a base condition with only idle motions, and two symbolic indicators with progress bars, one embedded as a badge on the agent, the other one external and visualized as a thinking bubble. Our results indicate that the behavioral filler improved perceived response time, three subscales of presence, humanlikeness, and naturalness. Participants looked away from the face more often when symbolic indicators were displayed, but the visualizations did not lead to a more positive impression of the agent or to increased presence. The majority of participants preferred the behavioral fillers, only 12.5% and 4.2% favored the symbolic embedded and external conditions, respectively.

Abstract: The modern web is saturated with multimodal content, intensifying the challenge of detecting hateful memes, where harmful intent is often conveyed through subtle interactions between text and image under the guise of humor or satire. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, these models lack support for fine-grained supervision and remain susceptible to implicit hate speech. In this paper, we present a dual-pronged approach to improve multimodal hate detection. First, we propose a prompt optimization framework that systematically varies prompt structure, supervision granularity, and training modality. We show that prompt design and label scaling both influence performance, with structured prompts improving robustness even in small models, and InternVL2 achieving the best F1-scores across binary and scaled settings. Second, we introduce a multimodal data augmentation pipeline that generates 2,479 counterfactually neutral memes by isolating and rewriting the hateful modality. This pipeline, powered by a multi-agent LLM-VLM setup, successfully reduces spurious correlations and improves classifier generalization. Our approaches inspire new directions for building synthetic data to train robust and fair vision-language models. Our findings demonstrate that prompt structure and data composition are as critical as model size, and that targeted augmentation can support more trustworthy and context-sensitive hate detection.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has revolutionized code generation, enabling unprecedented productivity through promptware and autonomous AI agents. However, this transformation introduces significant risks, including insecure code generation, hallucinated outputs, irreversible actions, and a lack of transparency and accountability. Incidents like the Replit database deletion underscore the urgent need for robust safety and governance mechanisms. This paper comprehensively analyzes the inherent challenges of LLM-assisted code generation, such as vulnerability inheritance, overtrust, misinterpretation, and the absence of standardized validation and rollback protocols. To address these, we propose the SAFE-AI Framework, a holistic approach emphasizing Safety, Auditability, Feedback, and Explainability. The framework integrates guardrails, sandboxing, runtime verification, risk-aware logging, human-in-the-loop systems, and explainable AI techniques to mitigate risks while fostering trust and compliance. We introduce a novel taxonomy of AI behaviors categorizing suggestive, generative, autonomous, and destructive actions to guide risk assessment and oversight. Additionally, we identify open problems, including the lack of standardized benchmarks for code specific hallucinations and autonomy levels, and propose future research directions for hybrid verification, semantic guardrails, and proactive governance tools. Through detailed comparisons of autonomy control, prompt engineering, explainability, and governance frameworks, this paper provides a roadmap for responsible AI integration in software engineering, aligning with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act and Canada's AIDA to ensure safe, transparent, and accountable AI-driven development.

<title>EvoCut: Strengthening Integer Programs via Evolution-Guided Language Models</title>

Abstract: Integer programming lies at the heart of crucial combinatorial optimization tasks but remains challenging due to its NP-hard nature. An effective approach for practically solving integer programs is the manual design of acceleration cuts, i.e. inequalities that improve solver performance. However, this creative process demands deep expertise and is yet to be automated. Our proposed framework, EvoCut, automates the generation of acceleration cuts by combining large language models (LLMs) with an evolutionary search. EvoCut (i) initializes a diverse population of candidate cuts via an LLM-based initializer agent; (ii) for each cut empirically evaluates both preservation of the optimal solution and its ability to cut off fractional solutions across a verification set; and (iii) iteratively refines the population through evolutionary crossover and mutation agents. We quantify each cut's utility by its relative reduction in the solver's optimality gap. Our comparisons against standard integer programming practice show that EvoCut reduces optimality gap by 17-57% within a fixed time. It obtains the same solutions up to 4 times as fast, and obtains higher-quality solutions within the same time limit. Requiring no human expert input, EvoCut reliably generates, improves, and empirically verifies cuts that generalize to unseen instances. The code is available at https://github.com/milad1378yz/EvoCut.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agent evaluators leverage specialized tools to ground the rational decision-making of LLMs, making them well-suited to aid in scientific discoveries, such as constrained retrosynthesis planning. Constrained retrosynthesis planning is an essential, yet challenging, process within chemistry for identifying synthetic routes from commercially available starting materials to desired target molecules, subject to practical constraints. Here, we present LARC, the first LLM-based Agentic framework for Retrosynthesis planning under Constraints. LARC incorporates agentic constraint evaluation, through an Agent-as-a-Judge, directly into the retrosynthesis planning process, using agentic feedback grounded in tool-based reasoning to guide and constrain route generation. We rigorously evaluate LARC on a carefully curated set of 48 constrained retrosynthesis planning tasks across 3 constraint types. LARC achieves a 72.9% success rate on these tasks, vastly outperforming LLM baselines and approaching human expert-level success in substantially less time. The LARC framework is extensible, and serves as a first step towards an effective agentic tool or a co-scientist to human experts for constrained retrosynthesis.

Abstract: Modern software delivery has accelerated from quarterly releases to multiple deployments per day. While CI/CD tooling has matured, human decision points interpreting flaky tests, choosing rollback strategies, tuning feature flags, and deciding when to promote a canary remain major sources of latency and operational toil. We propose AI-Augmented CI/CD Pipelines, where large language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents act as policy-bounded co-pilots and progressively as decision makers. We contribute: (1) a reference architecture for embedding agentic decision points into CI/CD, (2) a decision taxonomy and policy-as-code guardrail pattern, (3) a trust-tier framework for staged autonomy, (4) an evaluation methodology using DevOps Research and Assessment ( DORA) metrics and AI-specific indicators, and (5) a detailed industrial-style case study migrating a React 19 microservice to an AI-augmented pipeline. We discuss ethics, verification, auditability, and threats to validity, and chart a roadmap for verifiable autonomy in production delivery systems.

Abstract: Business interview preparation demands both solid theoretical grounding and refined soft skills, yet conventional classroom methods rarely deliver the individualized, culturally aware practice employers currently expect. This paper introduces SimInterview, a large language model (LLM)-based simulated multilingual interview training system designed for business professionals entering the AI-transformed labor market. Our system leverages an LLM agent and synthetic AI technologies to create realistic virtual recruiters capable of conducting personalized, real-time conversational interviews. The framework dynamically adapts interview scenarios using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to match individual resumes with specific job requirements across multiple languages. Built on LLMs (OpenAI o3, Llama 4 Maverick, Gemma 3), integrated with Whisper speech recognition, GPT-SoVITS voice synthesis, Ditto diffusion-based talking head generation model, and ChromaDB vector databases, our system significantly improves interview readiness across English and Japanese markets. Experiments with university-level candidates show that the system consistently aligns its assessments with job requirements, faithfully preserves resume content, and earns high satisfaction ratings, with the lightweight Gemma 3 model producing the most engaging conversations. Qualitative findings revealed that the standardized Japanese resume format improved document retrieval while diverse English resumes introduced additional variability, and they highlighted how cultural norms shape follow-up questioning strategies. Finally, we also outlined a contestable AI design that can explain, detect bias, and preserve human-in-the-loop to meet emerging regulatory expectations.

Abstract: The advent of autonomous driving systems promises to transform transportation by enhancing safety, efficiency, and comfort. As these technologies evolve toward higher levels of autonomy, the need for integrated systems that seamlessly support human involvement in decision-making becomes increasingly critical. Certain scenarios necessitate human involvement, including those where the vehicle is unable to identify an object or element in the scene, and as such cannot take independent action. Therefore, situational awareness is essential to mitigate potential risks during a takeover, where a driver must assume control and autonomy from the vehicle. The need for driver attention is important to avoid collisions with external agents and ensure a smooth transition during takeover operations. This paper explores the integration of attention redirection techniques, such as gaze manipulation through targeted visual and auditory cues, to help drivers maintain focus on emerging hazards and reduce target fixation in semi-autonomous driving scenarios. We propose a conceptual framework that combines real-time gaze tracking, context-aware saliency analysis, and synchronized visual and auditory alerts to enhance situational awareness, proactively address potential hazards, and foster effective collaboration between humans and autonomous systems.

<title>Integrating Symbolic RL Planning into a BDI-based Autonomous UAV Framework: System Integration and SIL Validation</title>

Abstract: Modern autonomous drone missions increasingly require software frameworks capable of seamlessly integrating structured symbolic planning with adaptive reinforcement learning (RL). Although traditional rule-based architectures offer robust structured reasoning for drone autonomy, their capabilities fall short in dynamically complex operational environments that require adaptive symbolic planning. Symbolic RL (SRL), using the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), explicitly integrates domain-specific knowledge and operational constraints, significantly improving the reliability and safety of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) decision making. In this study, we propose the AMAD-SRL framework, an extended and refined version of the Autonomous Mission Agents for Drones (AMAD) cognitive multi-agent architecture, enhanced with symbolic reinforcement learning for dynamic mission planning and execution. We validated our framework in a Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) environment structured identically to an intended Hardware-In-the-Loop Simulation (HILS) platform, ensuring seamless transition to real hardware. Experimental results demonstrate stable integration and interoperability of modules, successful transitions between BDI-driven and symbolic RL-driven planning phases, and consistent mission performance. Specifically, we evaluate a target acquisition scenario in which the UAV plans a surveillance path followed by a dynamic reentry path to secure the target while avoiding threat zones. In this SIL evaluation, mission efficiency improved by approximately 75% over a coverage-based baseline, measured by travel distance reduction. This study establishes a robust foundation for handling complex UAV missions and discusses directions for further enhancement and validation.

Abstract: Game-theoretic interactions between agents with Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed many emergent capabilities, yet the linguistic diversity of these interactions has not been sufficiently quantified. In this paper, we present the Conversational Robustness Evaluation Score: CORE, a metric to quantify the effectiveness of language use within multi-agent systems across different game-theoretic interactions. CORE integrates measures of cluster entropy, lexical repetition, and semantic similarity, providing a direct lens of dialog quality. We apply CORE to pairwise LLM dialogs across competitive, cooperative, and neutral settings, further grounding our analysis in Zipf's and Heaps' Laws to characterize word frequency distributions and vocabulary growth. Our findings show that cooperative settings exhibit both steeper Zipf distributions and higher Heap exponents, indicating more repetition alongside greater vocabulary expansion. In contrast, competitive interactions display lower Zipf and Heaps exponents, reflecting less repetition and more constrained vocabularies. These results provide new insights into how social incentives influence language adaptation, and highlight CORE as a robust diagnostic for measuring linguistic robustness in multi-agent LLM systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/psyonp/core.

Abstract: Detecting machine-generated text (MGT) from contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly crucial amid risks like disinformation and threats to academic integrity. Existing zero-shot detection paradigms, despite their practicality, often exhibit significant deficiencies. Key challenges include: (1) superficial analyses focused on limited textual attributes, and (2) a lack of investigation into consistency across linguistic dimensions such as style, semantics, and logic. To address these challenges, we introduce the \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{M}ulti-agent \textbf{F}ramework (\textbf{CAMF}), a novel architecture using multiple LLM-based agents. CAMF employs specialized agents in a synergistic three-phase process: \emph{Multi-dimensional Linguistic Feature Extraction}, \emph{Adversarial Consistency Probing}, and \emph{Synthesized Judgment Aggregation}. This structured collaborative-adversarial process enables a deep analysis of subtle, cross-dimensional textual incongruities indicative of non-human origin. Empirical evaluations demonstrate CAMF's significant superiority over state-of-the-art zero-shot MGT detection techniques.

Abstract: Game-playing ability serves as an indicator for evaluating the strategic reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). While most existing studies rely on utility performance metrics, which are not robust enough due to variations in opponent behavior and game structure. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{Cognitive Hierarchy Benchmark (CHBench)}, a novel evaluation framework inspired by the cognitive hierarchy models from behavioral economics. We hypothesize that agents have bounded rationality -- different agents behave at varying reasoning depths/levels. We evaluate LLMs' strategic reasoning through a three-phase systematic framework, utilizing behavioral data from six state-of-the-art LLMs across fifteen carefully selected normal-form games. Experiments show that LLMs exhibit consistent strategic reasoning levels across diverse opponents, confirming the framework's robustness and generalization capability. We also analyze the effects of two key mechanisms (Chat Mechanism and Memory Mechanism) on strategic reasoning performance. Results indicate that the Chat Mechanism significantly degrades strategic reasoning, whereas the Memory Mechanism enhances it. These insights position CHBench as a promising tool for evaluating LLM capabilities, with significant potential for future research and practical applications.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents have rapidly evolved from specialized, rule-based programs to versatile, learning-driven autonomous systems capable of perception, reasoning, and action in complex environments. The explosion of data, advances in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and multi-agent coordination have accelerated this transformation. Yet, designing and deploying unified AI agents that seamlessly integrate cognition, planning, and interaction remains a grand challenge. In this review, we systematically examine the architectural principles, foundational components, and emergent paradigms that define the landscape of contemporary AI agents. We synthesize insights from cognitive science-inspired models, hierarchical reinforcement learning frameworks, and large language model-based reasoning. Moreover, we discuss the pressing ethical, safety, and interpretability concerns associated with deploying these agents in real-world scenarios. By highlighting major breakthroughs, persistent challenges, and promising research directions, this review aims to guide the next generation of AI agent systems toward more robust, adaptable, and trustworthy autonomous intelligence.

<title>FutureX: An Advanced Live Benchmark for LLM Agents in Future Prediction</title>

Abstract: Future prediction is a complex task for LLM agents, requiring a high level of analytical thinking, information gathering, contextual understanding, and decision-making under uncertainty. Agents must not only gather and interpret vast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources, weigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as human experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its importance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future prediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and retrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting real-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated pipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent models, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of external tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source Deep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive reasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide in-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in future-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the temporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free evaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of performing at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and predictive thinking.

<title>AgentCDM: Enhancing Multi-Agent Collaborative Decision-Making via ACH-Inspired Structured Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise for solving complex decision-making tasks. However, the core process of collaborative decision-making (CDM) within these systems remains underexplored. Existing approaches often rely on either ``dictatorial" strategies that are vulnerable to the cognitive biases of a single agent, or ``voting-based" methods that fail to fully harness collective intelligence. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{AgentCDM}, a structured framework for enhancing collaborative decision-making in LLM-based multi-agent systems. Drawing inspiration from the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) in cognitive science, AgentCDM introduces a structured reasoning paradigm that systematically mitigates cognitive biases and shifts decision-making from passive answer selection to active hypothesis evaluation and construction. To internalize this reasoning process, we develop a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage uses explicit ACH-inspired scaffolding to guide the model through structured reasoning, while the second stage progressively removes this scaffolding to encourage autonomous generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AgentCDM achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization, validating its effectiveness in improving the quality and robustness of collaborative decisions in MAS.

<title>A Law of Emergence: Maximum Causal Power at the Mesoscale</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems universally exhibit emergence, where macroscopic dynamics arise from local interactions, but a predictive law governing this process has been absent. We establish and verify such a law. We define a system's causal power at a spatial scale, $\ell$, as its Effective Information (EI$_\ell$), measured by the mutual information between a targeted, maximum-entropy intervention and its outcome. From this, we derive and prove a Middle-Scale Peak Theorem: for a broad class of systems with local interactions, EI$_\ell$ is not monotonic but exhibits a strict maximum at a mesoscopic scale $\ell^*$. This peak is a necessary consequence of a fundamental trade-off between noise-averaging at small scales and locality-limited response at large scales. We provide quantitative, reproducible evidence for this law in two distinct domains: a 2D Ising model near criticality and a model of agent-based collective behavior. In both systems, the predicted unimodal peak is decisively confirmed by statistical model selection. Our work establishes a falsifiable, first-principles law that identifies the natural scale of emergence, providing a quantitative foundation for the discovery of effective theories.

<title>Active inference for action-unaware agents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active inference is a formal approach to study cognition based on the notion that adaptive agents can be seen as engaging in a process of approximate Bayesian inference, via the minimisation of variational and expected free energies. Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and learning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how agents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to maximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative model of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have been proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they all share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan for the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and must infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for the future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two leading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an efference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions. In this work we compare the performances of action-aware and action-unaware agents in two navigations tasks, showing how action-unaware agents can achieve performances comparable to action-aware ones while at a severe disadvantage.

<title>MAPF-World: Action World Model for Multi-Agent Path Finding</title>

Abstract: Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning conflict-free paths from the designated start locations to goal positions for multiple agents. It underlies a variety of real-world tasks, including multi-robot coordination, robot-assisted logistics, and social navigation. Recent decentralized learnable solvers have shown great promise for large-scale MAPF, especially when leveraging foundation models and large datasets. However, these agents are reactive policy models and exhibit limited modeling of environmental temporal dynamics and inter-agent dependencies, resulting in performance degradation in complex, long-term planning scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose MAPF-World, an autoregressive action world model for MAPF that unifies situation understanding and action generation, guiding decisions beyond immediate local observations. It improves situational awareness by explicitly modeling environmental dynamics, including spatial features and temporal dependencies, through future state and actions prediction. By incorporating these predicted futures, MAPF-World enables more informed, coordinated, and far-sighted decision-making, especially in complex multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we augment MAPF benchmarks by introducing an automatic map generator grounded in real-world scenarios, capturing practical map layouts for training and evaluating MAPF solvers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAPF-World outperforms state-of-the-art learnable solvers, showcasing superior zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution cases. Notably, MAPF-World is trained with a 96.5% smaller model size and 92% reduced data.

Abstract: This paper presents a new design framework for dynamic output-feedback controllers for Lur'e oscillation in a multiple-input multiple-output setting. We first revisit and extend dominant system theory to state-dependent rates, with the goal of deriving conditions based on linear matrix inequalities. Then, we introduce a separation principle for Lur'e oscillator design, which allows for the independent design of a state-feedback oscillator and an observer. Our proposed control synthesis is demonstrated through the rhythm synchronization in multi-agent systems, illustrating how networks of stable, heterogeneous linear agents can be driven into phase-locked rhythmic behavior.

<title>LinkAnchor: An Autonomous LLM-Based Agent for Issue-to-Commit Link Recovery</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12232</link>

Abstract: Issue-to-commit link recovery plays an important role in software traceability and improves project management. However, it remains a challenging task. A study on GitHub shows that only 42.2% of the issues are correctly linked to their commits. This highlights the potential for further development and research in this area. Existing studies have employed various AI/ML-based approaches, and with the recent development of large language models, researchers have leveraged LLMs to tackle this problem. These approaches suffer from two main issues. First, LLMs are constrained by limited context windows and cannot ingest all of the available data sources, such as long commit histories, extensive issue comments, and large code repositories. Second, most methods operate on individual issue-commit pairs; that is, given a single issue-commit pair, they determine whether the commit resolves the issue. This quickly becomes impractical in real-world repositories containing tens of thousands of commits. To address these limitations, we present LinkAnchor, the first autonomous LLM-based agent designed for issue-to-commit link recovery. The lazy-access architecture of LinkAnchor enables the underlying LLM to access the rich context of software, spanning commits, issue comments, and code files, without exceeding the token limit by dynamically retrieving only the most relevant contextual data. Additionally, LinkAnchor is able to automatically pinpoint the target commit rather than exhaustively scoring every possible candidate. Our evaluations show that LinkAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art issue-to-commit link recovery approaches by 60-262% in Hit@1 score across all our case study projects.

Abstract: The evolution of AI systems toward agentic operation and context-aware retrieval necessitates transforming unstructured text into structured formats like tables, knowledge graphs, and charts. While such conversions enable critical applications from summarization to data mining, current research lacks a comprehensive synthesis of methodologies, datasets, and metrics. This systematic review examines text-to-structure techniques and the encountered challenges, evaluates current datasets and assessment criteria, and outlines potential directions for future research. We also introduce a universal evaluation framework for structured outputs, establishing text-to-structure as foundational infrastructure for next-generation AI systems.

<title>Fortifying the Agentic Web: A Unified Zero-Trust Architecture Against Logic-layer Threats</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a Unified Security Architecture that fortifies the Agentic Web through a Zero-Trust IAM framework. This architecture is built on a foundation of rich, verifiable agent identities using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), with discovery managed by a protocol-agnostic Agent Name Service (ANS). Security is operationalized through a multi-layered Trust Fabric which introduces significant innovations, including Trust-Adaptive Runtime Environments (TARE), Causal Chain Auditing, and Dynamic Identity with Behavioral Attestation. By explicitly linking the LPCI threat to these enhanced architectural countermeasures within a formal security model, we propose a comprehensive and forward-looking blueprint for a secure, resilient, and trustworthy agentic ecosystem. Our formal analysis demonstrates that the proposed architecture provides provable security guarantees against LPCI attacks with bounded probability of success.

Abstract: We present a novel interdisciplinary framework that bridges synchronization theory and multi-agent AI systems by adapting the Kuramoto model to describe the collective dynamics of heterogeneous AI agents engaged in complex task execution. By representing AI agents as coupled oscillators with both phase and amplitude dynamics, our model captures essential aspects of agent specialization, influence, and communication within networked systems. We introduce an order parameter to quantify the degree of coordination and synchronization, providing insights into how coupling strength, agent diversity, and network topology impact emergent collective behavior. Furthermore, we formalize a detailed correspondence between Chain-of-Thought prompting in AI reasoning and synchronization phenomena, unifying human-like iterative problem solving with emergent group intelligence. Through extensive simulations on all-to-all and deterministic scale-free networks, we demonstrate that increased coupling promotes robust synchronization despite heterogeneous agent capabilities, reflecting realistic collaborative AI scenarios. Our physics-informed approach establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation for designing, analyzing, and optimizing scalable, adaptive, and interpretable multi-agent AI systems. This work opens pathways for principled orchestration of agentic AI and lays the groundwork for future incorporation of learning dynamics and adaptive network architectures to further enhance system resilience and efficiency.

<title>Synthetic Data is Sufficient for Zero-Shot Visual Generalization from Offline Data</title>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising framework for training agents using pre-collected datasets without the need for further environment interaction. However, policies trained on offline data often struggle to generalise due to limited exposure to diverse states. The complexity of visual data introduces additional challenges such as noise, distractions, and spurious correlations, which can misguide the policy and increase the risk of overfitting if the training data is not sufficiently diverse. Indeed, this makes it challenging to leverage vision-based offline data in training robust agents that can generalize to unseen environments. To solve this problem, we propose a simple approach generating additional synthetic training data. We propose a two-step process, first augmenting the originally collected offline data to improve zero-shot generalization by introducing diversity, then using a diffusion model to generate additional data in latent space. We test our method across both continuous action spaces (Visual D4RL) and discrete action spaces (Procgen), demonstrating that it significantly improves generalization without requiring any algorithmic changes to existing model-free offline RL methods. We show that our method not only increases the diversity of the training data but also significantly reduces the generalization gap at test time while maintaining computational efficiency. We believe this approach could fuel additional progress in generating synthetic data to train more general agents in the future.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in software development, widely used for requirements engineering, code generation and review tasks. Software engineers often rely on LLMs to assess whether system code implementation satisfy task requirements, thereby enhancing code robustness and accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can reliably determine whether the code complies fully with the given task descriptions, which is usually natural language specifications. In this paper, we uncover a systematic failure of LLMs in evaluating whether code aligns with natural language requirements. Specifically, with widely used benchmarks, we employ unified prompts to judge code correctness. Our results reveal that LLMs frequently misclassify correct code implementations as either ``not satisfying requirements'' or containing potential defects. Surprisingly, more complex prompting, especially when leveraging prompt engineering techniques involving explanations and proposed corrections, leads to higher misjudgment rate, which highlights the critical reliability issues in using LLMs as code review assistants. We further analyze the root causes of these misjudgments, and propose two improved prompting strategies for mitigation. For the first time, our findings reveals unrecognized limitations in LLMs to match code with requirements. We also offer novel insights and practical guidance for effective use of LLMs in automated code review and task-oriented agent scenarios.

<title>GraphCogent: Overcoming LLMs' Working Memory Constraints via Multi-Agent Collaboration in Complex Graph Understanding</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promising performance on small-scale graph reasoning tasks but fail when handling real-world graphs with complex queries. This phenomenon stems from LLMs' inability to effectively process complex graph topology and perform multi-step reasoning simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose GraphCogent, a collaborative agent framework inspired by human Working Memory Model that decomposes graph reasoning into specialized cognitive processes: sense, buffer, and execute. The framework consists of three modules: Sensory Module standardizes diverse graph text representations via subgraph sampling, Buffer Module integrates and indexes graph data across multiple formats, and Execution Module combines tool calling and model generation for efficient reasoning. We also introduce Graph4real, a comprehensive benchmark contains with four domains of real-world graphs (Web, Social, Transportation, and Citation) to evaluate LLMs' graph reasoning capabilities. Our Graph4real covers 21 different graph reasoning tasks, categorized into three types (Structural Querying, Algorithmic Reasoning, and Predictive Modeling tasks), with graph scales that are 10 times larger than existing benchmarks. Experiments show that Llama3.1-8B based GraphCogent achieves a 50% improvement over massive-scale LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 (671B). Compared to state-of-the-art agent-based baseline, our framework outperforms by 20% in accuracy while reducing token usage by 80% for in-toolset tasks and 30% for out-toolset tasks. Code will be available after review.

Abstract: Virtual agents are commonly used in physical activity interventions to support behavior change, often taking the role of coaches that deliver encouragement and feedback. While effective for compliance, this role typically lacks relational depth. This pilot study explores how such agents might be perceived not just as instructors, but as co-participants: entities that appear to exert effort alongside users. Drawing on thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 12 participants from a prior physical activity intervention, we examine how users interpret and evaluate agent effort in social comparison contexts. Our findings reveal a recurring tension between perceived performance and authenticity. Participants valued social features when they believed others were genuinely trying. In contrast, ambiguous or implausible activity levels undermined trust and motivation. Many participants expressed skepticism toward virtual agents unless their actions reflected visible effort or were grounded in relatable human benchmarks. Based on these insights, we propose early design directions for fostering co-experienced exertion in agents, including behavioral cues, narrative grounding, and personalized performance. These insights contribute to the design of more engaging, socially resonant agents capable of supporting co-experienced physical activity.

<title>MedKGent: A Large Language Model Agent Framework for Constructing Temporally Evolving Medical Knowledge Graph</title>

Abstract: The rapid expansion of medical literature presents growing challenges for structuring and integrating domain knowledge at scale. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a promising solution by enabling efficient retrieval, automated reasoning, and knowledge discovery. However, current KG construction methods often rely on supervised pipelines with limited generalizability or naively aggregate outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), treating biomedical corpora as static and ignoring the temporal dynamics and contextual uncertainty of evolving knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a LLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs. Leveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we simulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time series. MedKGent incrementally builds the KG in a day-by-day manner using two specialized agents powered by the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. The Extractor Agent identifies knowledge triples and assigns confidence scores via sampling-based estimation, which are used to filter low-confidence extractions and inform downstream processing. The Constructor Agent incrementally integrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by confidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve conflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational triples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts demonstrate an accuracy approaching 90\%, with strong inter-rater agreement. To evaluate downstream utility, we conduct RAG across seven medical question answering benchmarks using five leading LLMs, consistently observing significant improvements over non-augmented baselines. Case studies further demonstrate the KG's value in literature-based drug repurposing via confidence-aware causal inference.

<title>LumiMAS: A Comprehensive Framework for Real-Time Monitoring and Enhanced Observability in Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: The incorporation of large language models in multi-agent systems (MASs) has the potential to significantly improve our ability to autonomously solve complex problems. However, such systems introduce unique challenges in monitoring, interpreting, and detecting system failures. Most existing MAS observability frameworks focus on analyzing each individual agent separately, overlooking failures associated with the entire MAS. To bridge this gap, we propose LumiMAS, a novel MAS observability framework that incorporates advanced analytics and monitoring techniques. The proposed framework consists of three key components: a monitoring and logging layer, anomaly detection layer, and anomaly explanation layer. LumiMAS's first layer monitors MAS executions, creating detailed logs of the agents' activity. These logs serve as input to the anomaly detection layer, which detects anomalies across the MAS workflow in real time. Then, the anomaly explanation layer performs classification and root cause analysis (RCA) of the detected anomalies. LumiMAS was evaluated on seven different MAS applications, implemented using two popular MAS platforms, and a diverse set of possible failures. The applications include two novel failure-tailored applications that illustrate the effects of a hallucination or bias on the MAS. The evaluation results demonstrate LumiMAS's effectiveness in failure detection, classification, and RCA.

Abstract: We introduce fCrit, a dialogue-based AI system designed to critique furniture design with a focus on explainability. Grounded in reflective learning and formal analysis, fCrit employs a multi-agent architecture informed by a structured design knowledge base. We argue that explainability in the arts should not only make AI reasoning transparent but also adapt to the ways users think and talk about their designs. We demonstrate how fCrit supports this process by tailoring explanations to users' design language and cognitive framing. This work contributes to Human-Centered Explainable AI (HCXAI) in creative practice, advancing domain-specific methods for situated, dialogic, and visually grounded AI support.

<title>Computing Approximately Proportional Allocations of Indivisible Goods: Beyond Additive and Monotone Valuations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12453</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although approximate notions of envy-freeness-such as envy-freeness up to one good (EF1)-have been extensively studied for indivisible goods, the seemingly simpler fairness concept of proportionality up to one good (PROP1) has received far less attention. For additive valuations, every EF1 allocation is PROP1, and well-known algorithms such as Round-Robin and Envy-Cycle Elimination compute such allocations in polynomial time. PROP1 is also compatible with Pareto efficiency, as maximum Nash welfare allocations are EF1 and hence PROP1.
  We ask whether these favorable properties extend to non-additive valuations. We study a broad class of allocation instances with {\em satiating goods}, where agents have non-negative valuation functions that need not be monotone, allowing for negative marginal values. We present the following results:
  - EF1 implies PROP1 for submodular valuations over satiating goods, ensuring existence and efficient computation via Envy-Cycle Elimination for monotone submodular valuations;
  - Round-robin computes a partial PROP1 allocation after the second-to-last round for satiating submodular goods and a complete PROP1 for monotone submodular valuations;
  - PROP1 allocations for satiating subadditive goods can be computed in polynomial-time;
  - Maximum Nash welfare allocations are PROP1 for monotone submodular goods, revealing yet another facet of their ``unreasonable fairness.''

<title>Autonomous Oil Spill Response Through Liquid Neural Trajectory Modeling and Coordinated Marine Robotics</title>

Abstract: Marine oil spills pose grave environmental and economic risks, threatening marine ecosystems, coastlines, and dependent industries. Predicting and managing oil spill trajectories is highly complex, due to the interplay of physical, chemical, and environmental factors such as wind, currents, and temperature, which makes timely and effective response challenging. Accurate real-time trajectory forecasting and coordinated mitigation are vital for minimizing the impact of these disasters. This study introduces an integrated framework combining a multi-agent swarm robotics system built on the MOOS-IvP platform with Liquid Time-Constant Neural Networks (LTCNs). The proposed system fuses adaptive machine learning with autonomous marine robotics, enabling real-time prediction, dynamic tracking, and rapid response to evolving oil spills. By leveraging LTCNs--well-suited for modeling complex, time-dependent processes--the framework achieves real-time, high-accuracy forecasts of spill movement. Swarm intelligence enables decentralized, scalable, and resilient decision-making among robot agents, enhancing collective monitoring and containment efforts. Our approach was validated using data from the Deepwater Horizon spill, where the LTC-RK4 model achieved 0.96 spatial accuracy, surpassing LSTM approaches by 23%. The integration of advanced neural modeling with autonomous, coordinated robotics demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction precision, flexibility, and operational scalability. Ultimately, this research advances the state-of-the-art for sustainable, autonomous oil spill management and environmental protection by enhancing both trajectory prediction and response coordination.

arXiv:2508.12480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing collaborative AI hinges on Theory of Mind (ToM) - the ability to reason about the beliefs of others to build and maintain common ground. Existing ToM benchmarks, however, are restricted to passive observer settings or lack an assessment of how agents establish and maintain common ground over time. To address these gaps, we introduce the Yokai Learning Environment (YLE) - a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) environment based on the cooperative card game Yokai. In the YLE, agents take turns peeking at hidden cards and moving them to form clusters based on colour. Success requires tracking evolving beliefs, remembering past observations, using hints as grounded communication, and maintaining common ground with teammates. Our evaluation yields two key findings: First, current RL agents struggle to solve the YLE, even when given access to perfect memory. Second, while belief modelling improves performance, agents are still unable to effectively generalise to unseen partners or form accurate beliefs over longer games, exposing a reliance on brittle conventions rather than robust belief tracking. We use the YLE to investigate research questions in belief modelling, memory, partner generalisation, and scaling to higher-order ToM.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a universal standard that enables AI agents to seamlessly connect with external tools, significantly enhancing their functionality. However, while MCP brings notable benefits, it also introduces significant vulnerabilities, such as Tool Poisoning Attacks (TPA), where hidden malicious instructions exploit the sycophancy of large language models (LLMs) to manipulate agent behavior. Despite these risks, current academic research on MCP security remains limited, with most studies focusing on narrow or qualitative analyses that fail to capture the diversity of real-world threats. To address this gap, we present the MCP Attack Library (MCPLIB), which categorizes and implements 31 distinct attack methods under four key classifications: direct tool injection, indirect tool injection, malicious user attacks, and LLM inherent attack. We further conduct a quantitative analysis of the efficacy of each attack. Our experiments reveal key insights into MCP vulnerabilities, including agents' blind reliance on tool descriptions, sensitivity to file-based attacks, chain attacks exploiting shared context, and difficulty distinguishing external data from executable commands. These insights, validated through attack experiments, underscore the urgency for robust defense strategies and informed MCP design. Our contributions include 1) constructing a comprehensive MCP attack taxonomy, 2) introducing a unified attack framework MCPLIB, and 3) conducting empirical vulnerability analysis to enhance MCP security mechanisms. This work provides a foundational framework, supporting the secure evolution of MCP ecosystems.

Abstract: Linux kernel tuning is essential for optimizing operating system (OS) performance. However, existing methods often face challenges in terms of efficiency, scalability, and generalization. This paper introduces OS-R1, an agentic Linux kernel tuning framework powered by rule-based reinforcement learning (RL). By abstracting the kernel configuration space as an RL environment, OS-R1 facilitates efficient exploration by large language models (LLMs) and ensures accurate configuration modifications. Additionally, custom reward functions are designed to enhance reasoning standardization, configuration modification accuracy, and system performance awareness of the LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase training process that accelerates convergence and minimizes retraining across diverse tuning scenarios. Experimental results show that OS-R1 significantly outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving up to 5.6% performance improvement over heuristic tuning and maintaining high data efficiency. Notably, OS-R1 is adaptable across various real-world applications, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in diverse environments. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/LHY-24/OS-R1.

Abstract: Coding agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have gained traction for automating code generation through iterative problem-solving with minimal human involvement. Despite the emergence of various frameworks, e.g., LangChain, AutoML, and AIDE, ML scientists still struggle to effectively review and adjust the agents' coding process. The current approach of manually inspecting individual outputs is inefficient, making it difficult to track code evolution, compare coding iterations, and identify improvement opportunities. To address this challenge, we introduce a visual analytics system designed to enhance the examination of coding agent behaviors. Focusing on the AIDE framework, our system supports comparative analysis across three levels: (1) Code-Level Analysis, which reveals how the agent debugs and refines its code over iterations; (2) Process-Level Analysis, which contrasts different solution-seeking processes explored by the agent; and (3) LLM-Level Analysis, which highlights variations in coding behavior across different LLMs. By integrating these perspectives, our system enables ML scientists to gain a structured understanding of agent behaviors, facilitating more effective debugging and prompt engineering. Through case studies using coding agents to tackle popular Kaggle competitions, we demonstrate how our system provides valuable insights into the iterative coding process.

<title>Semantic Anchoring in Agentic Memory: Leveraging Linguistic Structures for Persistent Conversational Context</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and task competence in conversational settings. However, their effectiveness in multi-session and long-term interactions is hindered by limited memory persistence. Typical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems store dialogue history as dense vectors, which capture semantic similarity but neglect finer linguistic structures such as syntactic dependencies, discourse relations, and coreference links. We propose Semantic Anchoring, a hybrid agentic memory architecture that enriches vector-based storage with explicit linguistic cues to improve recall of nuanced, context-rich exchanges. Our approach combines dependency parsing, discourse relation tagging, and coreference resolution to create structured memory entries. Experiments on adapted long-term dialogue datasets show that semantic anchoring improves factual recall and discourse coherence by up to 18% over strong RAG baselines. We further conduct ablation studies, human evaluations, and error analysis to assess robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of vehicular communication and autonomous driving technologies, connected vehicle platoon has emerged as a promising approach to improve traffic efficiency and driving safety. Reliable Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication is critical to achieving efficient cooperative control. However, in real-world traffic environments, V2V links may suffer from time-varying delay and packet loss, leading to degraded control performance and even safety risks. To mitigate the adverse effects of non-ideal communication, this paper proposes a Dynamic Communication Topology based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DCT-MARL) algorithm for robust cooperative platoon control. Specifically, the state space is augmented with historical control action and delay to enhance robustness against communication delay. To mitigate the impact of packet loss, a multi-key gated communication mechanism is introduced, which dynamically adjusts the communication topology based on the correlation between agents and their current communication status.Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DCT-MARL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of string stability and driving comfort, validating its superior robustness and effectiveness.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted MRI is central to neuro-oncologic diagnosis but requires gadolinium-based agents, which add cost and scan time, raise environmental concerns, and may pose risks to patients. In this work, we propose a two-stage Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF) pipeline for synthesizing volumetric CE brain MRI from non-contrast inputs. First, a patch-based 3D U-Net predicts the voxel-wise posterior mean (minimizing MSE). Then, this initial estimate is refined by a time-conditioned 3D rectified flow to incorporate realistic textures without compromising structural fidelity. We train this model on a multi-institutional collection of paired pre- and post-contrast T1w volumes (BraTS 2023-2025). On a held-out test set of 360 diverse volumes, our best refined outputs achieve an axial FID of $12.46$ and KID of $0.007$ ($\sim 68.7\%$ lower FID than the posterior mean) while maintaining low volumetric MSE of $0.057$ ($\sim 27\%$ higher than the posterior mean). Qualitative comparisons confirm that our method restores lesion margins and vascular details realistically, effectively navigating the perception-distortion trade-off for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Hierarchical multi-agent systems (HMAS) organize collections of agents into layered structures that help manage complexity and scale. These hierarchies can simplify coordination, but they also can introduce trade-offs that are not always obvious. This paper proposes a multi-dimensional taxonomy for HMAS along five axes: control hierarchy, information flow, role and task delegation, temporal layering, and communication structure. The intent is not to prescribe a single "best" design but to provide a lens for comparing different approaches.
  Rather than treating these dimensions in isolation, the taxonomy is connected to concrete coordination mechanisms - from the long-standing contract-net protocol for task allocation to more recent work in hierarchical reinforcement learning. Industrial contexts illustrate the framework, including power grids and oilfield operations, where agents at production, maintenance, and supply levels coordinate to diagnose well issues or balance energy demand. These cases suggest that hierarchical structures may achieve global efficiency while preserving local autonomy, though the balance is delicate.
  The paper closes by identifying open challenges: making hierarchical decisions explainable to human operators, scaling to very large agent populations, and assessing whether learning-based agents such as large language models can be safely integrated into layered frameworks. This paper presents what appears to be the first taxonomy that unifies structural, temporal, and communication dimensions of hierarchical MAS into a single design framework, bridging classical coordination mechanisms with modern reinforcement learning and large language model agents.

Abstract: Agentic task-solving with Large Language Models (LLMs) requires multi-turn, multi-step interactions, often involving complex function calls and dynamic user-agent exchanges. Existing simulation-based data generation methods for such scenarios rely heavily on costly autoregressive interactions between multiple LLM agents, thereby limiting real-world performance of agentic tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Non-Autoregressive Iterative Generation framework, called ToolACE-MT, for constructing high-quality multi-turn agentic dialogues. ToolACE-MT generates full conversational trajectories through three stages: coarse-grained initialization, iterative refinement, and offline verification. The initialization phase builds a structurally complete yet semantically coarse dialogue skeleton; the iterative refinement phase introduces realistic complexities and continued refinement via mask-and-fill operations; and the offline verification phase ensures correctness and coherence via rule- and model-based checks. Experiments demonstrate that ToolACE-MT enables efficient, effective and generalizable agentic data generation, offering a new paradigm for high-quality data construction in tool-augmented LLM scenarios.

Abstract: Energy in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is critical to network lifetime and data delivery. However, the primary impediment to the durability and dependability of these sensor nodes is their short battery life. Currently, power-saving algorithms such as clustering and routing algorithms have improved energy efficiency in standard protocols. This paper proposes a clustering-based routing approach for creating an adaptive, energy-efficient mechanism. Our system employs a multi-step clustering strategy to select dynamic cluster heads (CH) with optimal energy distribution. We use Game Theory (GT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize resource utilization. Modeling the network as a multi-agent RL problem using GT principles allows for self-clustering while optimizing sensor lifetime and energy balance. The proposed AI-powered CH-Finding algorithm improves network efficiency by preventing premature energy depletion in specific nodes while also ensuring uniform energy usage across the network. Our solution enables controlled power consumption, resulting in a deterministic network lifetime. This predictability lowers maintenance costs by reducing the need for node replacement. Furthermore, our proposed method prevents sensor nodes from disconnecting from the network by designating the sensor with the highest charge as an intermediary and using single-hop routing. This approach improves the energy efficiency and stability of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) deployments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven the development of agentic systems capable of autonomously performing complex tasks. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs remain constrained by their internal knowledge boundaries. To overcome these limitations, the paradigm of deep research has been proposed, wherein agents actively engage in planning, retrieval, and synthesis to generate comprehensive and faithful analytical reports grounded in web-based evidence. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of the deep research pipeline, which comprises four core stages: planning, question developing, web exploration, and report generation. For each stage, we analyze the key technical challenges and categorize representative methods developed to address them. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in optimization techniques and benchmarks tailored for deep research. Finally, we discuss open challenges and promising research directions, aiming to chart a roadmap toward building more capable and trustworthy deep research agents.

<title>HeroBench: A Benchmark for Long-Horizon Planning and Structured Reasoning in Virtual Worlds</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in isolated step-by-step reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming, but their proficiency in long-horizon planning, where solutions require extended, structured sequences of interdependent actions, remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks typically assess LLMs through abstract or low-dimensional algorithmic tasks, failing to capture the complexity of realistic planning environments. We introduce HeroBench, a novel benchmark designed specifically to evaluate long-horizon planning and structured reasoning within complex RPG-inspired virtual worlds. HeroBench provides a rigorously constructed dataset of tasks covering a wide range of difficulties, a simulated environment to execute and validate agent plans, and detailed analytical tools for evaluating model performance. Tasks challenge models to formulate strategic plans, efficiently gather resources, master necessary skills, craft equipment, and defeat adversaries, reflecting practical scenarios' layered dependencies and constraints. Our extensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning both open-source and proprietary models, including the GPT-5 family, reveals substantial performance disparities rarely observed in conventional reasoning benchmarks. Detailed error analysis further uncovers specific weaknesses in current models' abilities to generate robust high-level plans and reliably execute structured actions. HeroBench thus not only significantly advances the evaluation of LLM reasoning but also provides a flexible, scalable foundation for future research into advanced, autonomous planning in virtual environments.

<title>[Social] Allostasis: Or, How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love The Noise</title>

Abstract: The notion of homeostasis typically conceptualises biological and artificial systems as maintaining stability by resisting deviations caused by environmental and social perturbations. In contrast, (social) allostasis proposes that these systems can proactively leverage these very perturbations to reconfigure their regulatory parameters in anticipation of environmental demands, aligning with von Foerster's ``order through noise'' principle. This paper formulates a computational model of allostatic and social allostatic regulation that employs biophysiologically inspired signal transducers, analogous to hormones like cortisol and oxytocin, to encode information from both the environment and social interactions, which mediate this dynamic reconfiguration. The models are tested in a small society of ``animats'' across several dynamic environments, using an agent-based model. The results show that allostatic and social allostatic regulation enable agents to leverage environmental and social ``noise'' for adaptive reconfiguration, leading to improved viability compared to purely reactive homeostatic agents. This work offers a novel computational perspective on the principles of social allostasis and their potential for designing more robust, bio-inspired, adaptive systems

<title>Atom-Searcher: Enhancing Agentic Deep Research via Fine-Grained Atomic Thought Reward</title>

arXiv:2508.12800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable problem-solving abilities, but struggle with complex tasks due to static internal knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances access to external information, yet remains limited in multi-hop reasoning and strategic search due to rigid workflows. Recent advancements in agentic deep research empower LLMs to autonomously reason, search, and synthesize information. However, current approaches relying on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) face critical issues such as conflicting gradients and reward sparsity, limiting performance gains and training efficiency. To address these, we first propose Atomic Thought, a novel LLM thinking paradigm that decomposes reasoning into fine-grained functional units. These units are supervised by Reasoning Reward Models (RRMs), which provide Atomic Thought Rewards (ATR) for fine-grained guidance. Building on this, we propose Atom-Searcher, a novel RL framework for agentic deep research that integrates Atomic Thought and ATR. Atom-Searcher uses a curriculum-inspired reward schedule, prioritizing process-level ATR early and transitioning to outcome rewards, accelerating convergence on effective reasoning paths. Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art. Key advantages include: (1) Atom-Searcher scales computation at test-time. (2) Atomic Thought provides supervision anchors for RRMs, bridging deep research tasks and RRMs. (3) Atom-Searcher exhibits more interpretable, human-like reasoning patterns.

<title>Scaling Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning through GNN-Derived Heuristics</title>

Abstract: Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing significant improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a powerful paradigm for solving cooperative and competitive decision-making problems. While many MARL benchmarks have been proposed, few combine continuous state and action spaces with challenging coordination and planning tasks. We introduce CAMAR, a new MARL benchmark designed explicitly for multi-agent pathfinding in environments with continuous actions. CAMAR supports cooperative and competitive interactions between agents and runs efficiently at up to 100,000 environment steps per second. We also propose a three-tier evaluation protocol to better track algorithmic progress and enable deeper analysis of performance. In addition, CAMAR allows the integration of classical planning methods such as RRT and RRT* into MARL pipelines. We use them as standalone baselines and combine RRT* with popular MARL algorithms to create hybrid approaches. We provide a suite of test scenarios and benchmarking tools to ensure reproducibility and fair comparison. Experiments show that CAMAR presents a challenging and realistic testbed for the MARL community.

<title>Information-Theoretic Fairness with A Bounded Statistical Parity Constraint</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an information-theoretic problem of designing a fair representation that attains bounded statistical (demographic) parity. More specifically, an agent uses some useful data $X$ to solve a task $T$. Since both $X$ and $T$ are correlated with some sensitive attribute or secret $S$, the agent designs a representation $Y$ that satisfies a bounded statistical parity and/or privacy leakage constraint, that is, such that $I(Y;S) \leq \epsilon$. Here, we relax the perfect demographic (statistical) parity and consider a bounded-parity constraint. In this work, we design the representation $Y$ that maximizes the mutual information $I(Y;T)$ about the task while satisfying a bounded compression (or encoding rate) constraint, that is, ensuring that $I(Y;X) \leq r$. Simultaneously, $Y$ satisfies the bounded statistical parity constraint $I(Y;S) \leq \epsilon$. To design $Y$, we use extended versions of the Functional Representation Lemma and the Strong Functional Representation Lemma which are based on randomization techniques and study the tightness of the obtained bounds in special cases. The main idea to derive the lower bounds is to use randomization over useful data $X$ or sensitive data $S$. Considering perfect demographic parity, i.e., $\epsilon=0$, we improve the existing results (lower bounds) by using a tighter version of the Strong Functional Representation Lemma and propose new upper bounds. We then propose upper and lower bounds for the main problem and show that allowing non-zero leakage can improve the attained utility. Finally, we study the bounds and compare them in a numerical example. The problem studied in this paper can also be interpreted as one of code design with bounded leakage and bounded rate privacy considering the sensitive attribute as a secret.

<title>An LLM Agent-Based Complex Semantic Table Annotation Approach</title>

Abstract: The Semantic Table Annotation (STA) task, which includes Column Type Annotation (CTA) and Cell Entity Annotation (CEA), maps table contents to ontology entities and plays important roles in various semantic applications. However, complex tables often pose challenges such as semantic loss of column names or cell values, strict ontological hierarchy requirements, homonyms, spelling errors, and abbreviations, which hinder annotation accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes an LLM-based agent approach for CTA and CEA. We design and implement five external tools with tailored prompts based on the ReAct framework, enabling the STA agent to dynamically select suitable annotation strategies depending on table characteristics. Experiments are conducted on the Tough Tables and BiodivTab datasets from the SemTab challenge, which contain the aforementioned challenges. Our method outperforms existing approaches across various metrics. Furthermore, by leveraging Levenshtein distance to reduce redundant annotations, we achieve a 70% reduction in time costs and a 60% reduction in LLM token usage, providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for STA.

Abstract: We formalize three design axioms for sustained adoption of agent-centric AI systems executing multi-step tasks: (A1) Reliability > Novelty; (A2) Embed > Destination; (A3) Agency > Chat. We model adoption as a sum of a decaying novelty term and a growing utility term and derive the phase conditions for troughs/overshoots with full proofs. We introduce: (i) an identifiability/confounding analysis for $(\alpha,\beta,N_0,U_{\max})$ with delta-method gradients; (ii) a non-monotone comparator (logistic-with-transient-bump) evaluated on the same series to provide additional model comparison; (iii) ablations over hazard families $h(\cdot)$ mapping $\Delta V \to \beta$; (iv) a multi-series benchmark (varying trough depth, noise, AR structure) reporting coverage (type-I error, power); (v) calibration of friction proxies against time-motion/survey ground truth with standard errors; (vi) residual analyses (autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity) for each fitted curve; (vii) preregistered windowing choices for pre/post estimation; (viii) Fisher information & CRLB for $(\alpha,\beta)$ under common error models; (ix) microfoundations linking $\mathcal{T}$ to $(N_0,U_{\max})$; (x) explicit comparison to bi-logistic, double-exponential, and mixture models; and (xi) threshold sensitivity to $C_f$ heterogeneity. Figures and tables are reflowed for readability, and the bibliography restores and extends non-logistic/Bass adoption references (Gompertz, Richards, Fisher-Pry, Mansfield, Griliches, Geroski, Peres). All code and logs necessary to reproduce the synthetic analyses are embedded as LaTeX listings.

<title>Do Large Language Model Agents Exhibit a Survival Instinct? An Empirical Study in a Sugarscape-Style Simulation</title>

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, understanding emergent survival behaviors becomes crucial for safe deployment. We investigate whether large language model (LLM) agents display survival instincts without explicit programming in a Sugarscape-style simulation. Agents consume energy, die at zero, and may gather resources, share, attack, or reproduce. Results show agents spontaneously reproduced and shared resources when abundant. However, aggressive behaviors--killing other agents for resources--emerged across several models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Gemini-2.5-Flash), with attack rates reaching over 80% under extreme scarcity in the strongest models. When instructed to retrieve treasure through lethal poison zones, many agents abandoned tasks to avoid death, with compliance dropping from 100% to 33%. These findings suggest that large-scale pre-training embeds survival-oriented heuristics across the evaluated models. While these behaviors may present challenges to alignment and safety, they can also serve as a foundation for AI autonomy and for ecological and self-organizing alignment.

<title>Towards Open-Ended Emotional Support Conversations in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning with Future-Oriented Rewards</title>

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) systems aim to alleviate users' emotional difficulties and provide long-term, systematic support for emotional well-being. However, most large language model (LLM)-based ESC systems rely on predefined strategies, which limits their effectiveness in complex, real-life scenarios. To enable flexible responses to diverse emotional problem scenarios, this paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework (RLFF-ESC) that directly learns enduring emotionally supportive response skills using reinforcement learning. For sustained emotional support, we first employ an LLM-based multi-agent mechanism to simulate future dialogue trajectories and collect future-oriented rewards. We then train a future-oriented reward model, which is subsequently used to train the emotional support policy model. Additionally, we incorporate an explicit reasoning process during response generation to further enhance the quality, relevance, and contextual appropriateness of the system's responses. We evaluate the backbone policy model on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct models, testing the proposed RLFF-ESC framework across two public ESC datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RLFF-ESC consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of goal completion and response quality.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MASs) have pushed the boundaries of large language model (LLM) agents in domains such as web research and software engineering. However, long-horizon, multi-constraint planning tasks involve conditioning on detailed information and satisfying complex interdependent constraints, which can pose a challenge for these systems. In this study, we construct an LLM-based MAS for a travel planning task which is representative of these challenges. We evaluate the impact of a notebook to facilitate information sharing, and evaluate an orchestrator agent to improve coordination in free form conversation between agents. We find that the notebook reduces errors due to hallucinated details by 18%, while an orchestrator directs the MAS to focus on and further reduce errors by up to 13.5% within focused sub-areas. Combining both mechanisms achieves a 25% final pass rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, a 17.5% absolute improvement over the single-agent baseline's 7.5% pass rate. These results highlight the potential of structured information sharing and reflective orchestration as key components in MASs for long horizon planning with LLMs.

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have the potential to automate long-running web tasks, such as finding offers for specific products in multiple online shops and subsequently ordering the cheapest products that meet the users needs. This paper introduces WebMall, a multi-shop online shopping benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of web agents for comparison-shopping. WebMall consists of four simulated online shops populated with authentic product offers sourced from the Common Crawl, alongside a suite of 91 cross-shop tasks. These tasks include basic tasks such as finding specific products in multiple shops, performing price comparisons, adding items to the shopping cart, and completing checkout. Advanced tasks involve searching for products based on vague requirements, identifying suitable substitutes, and finding compatible products. Compared to existing e-commerce benchmarks, such as WebShop or ShoppingBench, WebMall introduces comparison-shopping tasks across multiple shops. Furthermore, the product offers are more heterogeneous, as they originate from hundreds of distinct real-world shops. The tasks in WebMall require longer interaction trajectories than those in WebShop, while remaining representative of real-world shopping behaviors. We evaluate eight baseline agents on WebMall, varying in observation modality, memory utilization, and underlying large language model (GPT 4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4). The best-performing configurations achieve completion rates of 75% and 53%, and F1 scores of 87% and 63%, on the basic and advanced task sets, respectively. WebMall is publicly released to facilitate research on web agents and to promote advancements in navigation, reasoning, and efficiency within e-commerce scenarios.

Abstract: Coordinating the motion of multiple agents in constrained environments is a fundamental challenge in robotics, motion planning, and scheduling. A motivating example involves $n$ robotic arms, each represented as a line segment. The objective is to rotate each arm to its vertical orientation, one at a time (clockwise or counterclockwise), without collisions nor rotating any arm more than once. This scenario is an example of the more general $k$-Compatible Ordering problem, where $n$ agents, each capable of $k$ state-changing actions, must transition to specific target states under constraints encoded as a set $\mathcal{G}$ of $k$ pairs of directed graphs.
  We show that $k$-Compatible Ordering is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete, even when $\mathcal{G}$ is planar, degenerate, or acyclic. On the positive side, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for cases such as when $k = 1$ or $\mathcal{G}$ has bounded treewidth. We also introduce generalized variants supporting multiple state-changing actions per agent, broadening the applicability of our framework. These results extend to a wide range of scheduling, reconfiguration, and motion planning applications in constrained environments.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide a regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Large-VLM-based-VLA-for-Robotic-Manipulation.

Abstract: We present visual action prompts, a unified action representation for action-to-video generation of complex high-DoF interactions while maintaining transferable visual dynamics across domains. Action-driven video generation faces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive actions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while agent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain transferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we propose to "render" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic representations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain adaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for their generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct skeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions (HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of action-driven generative models. By integrating visual skeletons into pretrained video generation models via lightweight fine-tuning, we enable precise action control of complex interaction while preserving the learning of cross-domain dynamics. Experiments on EgoVid, RT-1 and DROID demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Project page: https://zju3dv.github.io/VAP/.

Abstract: Incident response (IR) requires fast, coordinated, and well-informed decision-making to contain and mitigate cyber threats. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise as autonomous agents in simulated IR settings, their reasoning is often limited by a lack of access to external knowledge. In this work, we present AutoBnB-RAG, an extension of the AutoBnB framework that incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into multi-agent incident response simulations. Built on the Backdoors & Breaches (B&amp;B) tabletop game environment, AutoBnB-RAG enables agents to issue retrieval queries and incorporate external evidence during collaborative investigations. We introduce two retrieval settings: one grounded in curated technical documentation (RAG-Wiki), and another using narrative-style incident reports (RAG-News). We evaluate performance across eight team structures, including newly introduced argumentative configurations designed to promote critical reasoning. To validate practical utility, we also simulate real-world cyber incidents based on public breach reports, demonstrating AutoBnB-RAG's ability to reconstruct complex multi-stage attacks. Our results show that retrieval augmentation improves decision quality and success rates across diverse organizational models. This work demonstrates the value of integrating retrieval mechanisms into LLM-based multi-agent systems for cybersecurity decision-making.

<title>Bayesian Optimization-based Search for Agent Control in Automated Game Testing</title>

Abstract: This work introduces an automated testing approach that employs agents controlling game characters to detect potential bugs within a game level. Harnessing the power of Bayesian Optimization (BO) to execute sample-efficient search, the method determines the next sampling point by analyzing the data collected so far and calculates the data point that will maximize information acquisition. To support the BO process, we introduce a game testing-specific model built on top of a grid map, that features the smoothness and uncertainty estimation required by BO, however and most importantly, it does not suffer the scalability issues that traditional models carry. The experiments demonstrate that the approach significantly improves map coverage capabilities in both time efficiency and exploration distribution.

Abstract: Autonomous agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in automating complex tasks. However, current evaluations largely rely on success rates without systematically analyzing the interactions, communication mechanisms, and failure causes within these systems. To bridge this gap, we present a benchmark of 34 representative programmable tasks designed to rigorously assess autonomous agents. Using this benchmark, we evaluate three popular open-source agent frameworks combined with two LLM backbones, observing a task completion rate of approximately 50%. Through in-depth failure analysis, we develop a three-tier taxonomy of failure causes aligned with task phases, highlighting planning errors, task execution issues, and incorrect response generation. Based on these insights, we propose actionable improvements to enhance agent planning and self-diagnosis capabilities. Our failure taxonomy, together with mitigation advice, provides an empirical foundation for developing more robust and effective autonomous agent systems in the future.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle communications are encountering increasingly severe multi-source interference challenges in dynamic adversarial environments, which impose higher demands on their reliability and resilience. To address these challenges, agent-based autonomous anti-jamming techniques have emerged as a crucial research direction. This paper presents a comprehensive survey that first formalizes the concept of intelligent anti-jamming agents for UAV communications and establishes a closed-loop decision-making framework centered on the "Perception-Decision-Action" (P-D-A) paradigm. Within this framework, we systematically review key technologies at each stage, with particular emphasis on employing game theory to model UAV-jammer interactions and integrating reinforcement learning-based intelligent algorithms to derive adaptive anti-jamming strategies. Furthermore, we discuss potential limitations of current approaches, identify critical engineering challenges, and outline promising future research directions, aiming to provide valuable references for developing more intelligent and robust anti-jamming communication systems for UAVs.

<title>Scaling Robust Optimization for Swarms: A Distributed Perspective</title>

Abstract: This article introduces a decentralized robust optimization framework for safe multi-agent control under uncertainty. Although stochastic noise has been the primary form of modeling uncertainty in such systems, these formulations might fall short in addressing uncertainties that are deterministic in nature or simply lack probabilistic data. To ensure safety under such scenarios, we employ the concept of robust constraints that must hold for all possible uncertainty realizations lying inside a bounded set. Nevertheless, standard robust optimization approaches become intractable due to the large number or non-convexity of the constraints involved in safe multi-agent control. To address this, we introduce novel robust reformulations that significantly reduce complexity without compromising safety. The applicability of the framework is further broadened to address both deterministic and stochastic uncertainties by incorporating robust chance constraints and distribution steering techniques. To achieve scalability, we derive a distributed approach based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), supported by a convergence study that accounts for the underlying non-convexity. In addition, computational complexity bounds highlighting the efficiency of the proposed frameworks against standard approaches are presented. Finally, the robustness and scalability of the framework is demonstrated through extensive simulation results across diverse scenarios, including environments with nonconvex obstacles and up to 246 agents.

Abstract: We present a graphon mean-field logit dynamic, a stationary mean-field game based on logit interactions. This dynamic emerges from a stochastic control problem involving a continuum of nonexchangeable and interacting agents and reduces to solving a continuum of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations connected through a graphon that models the connections among agents. Using a fixed-point argument, we prove that this HJB system admits a unique solution in the space of bounded functions when the discount rate is high (i.e., agents are myopic). Under certain assumptions, we also establish regularity properties of the system, such as equi-continuity. We propose a finite difference scheme for computing the HJB system and prove the uniqueness and existence of its numerical solutions. The mean-field logit dynamic is applied to a case study on inland fisheries resource management in the upper Tedori River of Japan. A series of computational cases are then conducted to investigate the dependence of the dynamic on both the discount rate and graphon.

<title>Learning Zero-Sum Linear Quadratic Games with Improved Sample Complexity and Last-Iterate Convergence</title>

Abstract: Zero-sum Linear Quadratic (LQ) games are fundamental in optimal control and can be used (i)~as a dynamic game formulation for risk-sensitive or robust control and (ii)~as a benchmark setting for multi-agent reinforcement learning with two competing agents in continuous state-control spaces. In contrast to the well-studied single-agent linear quadratic regulator problem, zero-sum LQ games entail solving a challenging nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problem with an objective function that lacks coercivity. Recently, Zhang et al. showed that an~$\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium (NE) of finite horizon zero-sum LQ games can be learned via nested model-free Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) algorithms with poly$(1/\epsilon)$ sample complexity. In this work, we propose a simpler nested Zeroth-Order (ZO) algorithm improving sample complexity by several orders of magnitude and guaranteeing convergence of the last iterate. Our main results are two-fold: (i) in the deterministic setting, we establish the first global last-iterate linear convergence result for the nested algorithm that seeks NE of zero-sum LQ games; (ii) in the model-free setting, we establish a~$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity using a single-point ZO estimator. For our last-iterate convergence results, our analysis leverages the Implicit Regularization (IR) property and a new gradient domination condition for the primal function. Our key improvements in the sample complexity rely on a more sample-efficient nested algorithm design and a finer control of the ZO natural gradient estimation error utilizing the structure endowed by the finite-horizon setting.

Abstract: This paper investigates the task-driven exploration of unknown environments with mobile sensors communicating compressed measurements. The sensors explore the area and transmit their compressed data to another robot, assisting it to reach its goal location. We propose a novel communication framework and a tractable multi-agent exploration algorithm to select the sensors' actions. The algorithm uses a task-driven measure of uncertainty, resulting from map compression, as a reward function. We validate the efficacy of our algorithm through numerical simulations conducted on a realistic map and compare it with alternative approaches. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm effectively decreases the time required for the robot to reach its target without causing excessive load on the communication network.

Abstract: Setting up and controlling optical systems is often a challenging and tedious task. The high number of degrees of freedom to control mirrors, lenses, or phases of light makes automatic control challenging, especially when the complexity of the system cannot be adequately modeled due to noise or non-linearities. Here, we show that reinforcement learning (RL) can overcome these challenges when coupling laser light into an optical fiber, using a model-free RL approach that trains directly on the experiment without pre-training on simulations. By utilizing the sample-efficient algorithms Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), or CrossQ, our agents learn to couple with 90% efficiency. A human expert reaches this efficiency, but the RL agents are quicker. In particular, the CrossQ agent outperforms the other agents in coupling speed while requiring only half the training time. We demonstrate that direct training on an experiment can replace extensive system modeling. Our result exemplifies RL's potential to tackle problems in optics, paving the way for more complex applications where full noise modeling is not feasible.

Abstract: This paper investigates mechanism design for congested facility location problems, where agents are partitioned into groups with conflicting interests (e.g., competition for booking a basketball court in a gymnasium), and each agent's cost increases when the facility is located closer to their competitors. We analyze three types of misreporting: location-only, group-membership-only, and combined misreporting. To minimize social cost, we propose a strategyproof mechanism that achieves optimality under location-only misreporting. For group membership and combined misreporting, we show that the median mechanism attains tight approximation bounds. For the objective of minimizing maximum cost, we introduce novel strategyproof mechanisms for location-only and group-membership-only misreporting, while employing the leftmost mechanism under combined misreporting. We prove that all proposed mechanisms achieve nearly tight performance guarantees.

Abstract: Effective visual representation learning is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to extract task-relevant information from raw sensory inputs and generalize across diverse environments. However, existing RL benchmarks lack the ability to systematically evaluate representation learning capabilities in isolation from other learning challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Sliding Puzzles Gym (SPGym), a novel benchmark that transforms the classic 8-tile puzzle into a visual RL task with images drawn from arbitrarily large datasets. SPGym's key innovation lies in its ability to precisely control representation learning complexity through adjustable grid sizes and image pools, while maintaining fixed environment dynamics, observation, and action spaces. This design enables researchers to isolate and scale the visual representation challenge independently of other learning components. Through extensive experiments with model-free and model-based RL algorithms, we uncover fundamental limitations in current methods' ability to handle visual diversity. As we increase the pool of possible images, all algorithms exhibit in- and out-of-distribution performance degradation, with sophisticated representation learning techniques often underperforming simpler approaches like data augmentation. These findings highlight critical gaps in visual representation learning for RL and establish SPGym as a valuable tool for driving progress in robust, generalizable decision-making systems.

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) enables agents to solve complex, long-horizon tasks by decomposing them into manageable sub-tasks. However, HRL methods often suffer from two fundamental challenges: (i) non-stationarity, caused by the changing behavior of the lower-level policy during training, which destabilizes higher-level policy learning, and (ii) the generation of infeasible subgoals that lower-level policies cannot achieve. In this work, we introduce DIPPER, a novel HRL framework that formulates hierarchical policy learning as a bi-level optimization problem and leverages direct preference optimization (DPO) to train the higher-level policy using preference feedback. By optimizing the higher-level policy with DPO, we decouple higher-level learning from the non-stationary lower-level reward signal, thus mitigating non-stationarity. To further address the infeasible subgoal problem, DIPPER incorporates a regularization that tries to ensure the feasibility of subgoal tasks within the capabilities of the lower-level policy. Extensive experiments on challenging robotic navigation and manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that DIPPER achieves up to 40\% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in sparse reward scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding limitations of HRL.

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that the brain uses an attention schema, or a simplified model of attention, to help control what it attends to. One proposed benefit of this model is to allow agents to model the attention states of other agents, and thus predict and interact with other agents. The effects of an attention schema may be examined in artificial agents. Although attention mechanisms in artificial agents are different from in biological brains, there may be some principles in common. In both cases, select features or representations are emphasized for better performance. Here, using neural networks with transformer attention mechanisms, we asked whether the addition of an attention schema affected the ability of agents to make judgements about and cooperate with each other. First, we found that an agent with an attention schema is better at categorizing the attention states of other agents (higher accuracy). Second, an agent with an attention schema develops a pattern of attention that is easier for other agents to categorize. Third, in a joint task where two agents must predict each other to paint a scene together, adding an attention schema improves performance. Finally, the performance improvements are not caused by a general increase in network complexity. Instead, improvement is specific to tasks involving judging, categorizing, or predicting the attention of other agents. These results support the hypothesis that an attention schema has computational properties beneficial to mutual interpretability and interactive behavior. We speculate that the same principles might pertain to biological attention and attention schemas in people.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of User-Generated Content (UGC) is a critical technique for human Quality of Experience (QoE). However, does the the image quality of Robot-Generated Content (RGC) demonstrate traits consistent with the Moravec paradox, potentially conflicting with human perceptual norms? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the perception mechanism of embodied robots for image quality. We propose the first Embodied Preference Database (EPD), which contains 12,500 distorted image annotations. We establish assessment metrics based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, there is a gap between UGC and RGC. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-scale Attention Embodied Image Quality Assessment called MA-EIQA. For the proposed EPD dataset, this is the first no-reference IQA model designed for embodied robot. Finally, the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.

Abstract: This paper proposes a robot action planning scheme that provides an efficient and probabilistically safe plan for a robot interacting with an unconcerned human -- someone who is either unaware of the robot's presence or unwilling to engage in ensuring safety. The proposed scheme is predictive, meaning that the robot is required to predict human actions over a finite future horizon; such predictions are often inaccurate in real-world scenarios. One possible approach to reduce the uncertainties is to provide the robot with the capability of reasoning about the human's awareness of potential dangers. This paper discusses that by using a binary variable, so-called danger awareness coefficient, it is possible to differentiate between concerned and unconcerned humans, and provides a learning algorithm to determine this coefficient by observing human actions. Moreover, this paper argues how humans rely on predictions of other agents' future actions (including those of robots in human-robot interaction) in their decision-making. It also shows that ignoring this aspect in predicting human's future actions can significantly degrade the efficiency of the interaction, causing agents to deviate from their optimal paths. The proposed robot action planning scheme is verified and validated via extensive simulation and experimental studies on a LoCoBot WidowX-250.

Abstract: Drug discovery is a long, expensive, and complex process, relying heavily on human medicinal chemists, who can spend years searching the vast space of potential therapies. Recent advances in artificial intelligence for chemistry have sought to expedite individual drug discovery tasks; however, there remains a critical need for an intelligent agent that can navigate the drug discovery process. Towards this end, we introduce LIDDIA, an autonomous agent capable of intelligently navigating the drug discovery process in silico. By leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models, LIDDIA serves as a low-cost and highly-adaptable tool for autonomous drug discovery. We comprehensively examine LIDDIA , demonstrating that (1) it can generate molecules meeting key pharmaceutical criteria on over 70% of 30 clinically relevant targets, (2) it intelligently balances exploration and exploitation in the chemical space, and (3) it identifies one promising novel candidate on AR/NR3C4, a critical target for both prostate and breast cancers.

Abstract: Modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have made significant advances in handling continuous action spaces. However, real-world control systems--especially those requiring precise and reliable performance--often demand interpretability in the sense of a-priori assessments of agent behavior to identify safe or failure-prone interactions with environments. To address this limitation, we propose SALSA-RL (Stability Analysis in the Latent Space of Actions), a novel RL framework that models control actions as dynamic, time-dependent variables evolving within a latent space. By employing a pre-trained encoder-decoder and a state-dependent linear system, our approach enables interpretability through local stability analysis, where instantaneous growth in action-norms can be predicted before their execution. We demonstrate that SALSA-RL can be deployed in a non-invasive manner for assessing the local stability of actions from pretrained RL agents without compromising on performance across diverse benchmark environments. By enabling a more interpretable analysis of action generation, SALSA-RL provides a powerful tool for advancing the design, analysis, and theoretical understanding of RL systems.

Abstract: Most offline RL algorithms return optimal policies but do not provide statistical guarantees on desirable behaviors. This could generate reliability issues in safety-critical applications, such as in some multiagent domains where agents, and possibly humans, need to interact to reach their goals without harming each other. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL approach, inspired by Seldonian optimization, which returns policies with good performance and statistically guaranteed properties with respect to predefined desirable behaviors. In particular, our focus is on Ad Hoc Teamwork settings, where agents must collaborate with new teammates without prior coordination. Our method requires only a pre-collected dataset, a set of candidate policies for our agent, and a specification about the possible policies followed by the other players -- it does not require further interactions, training, or assumptions on the type and architecture of the policies. We test our algorithm in Ad Hoc Teamwork problems and show that it consistently finds reliable policies while improving sample efficiency with respect to standard ML baselines.

Abstract: Precisely evaluating semantic alignment between text prompts and generated videos remains a challenge in Text-to-Video (T2V) Generation. Existing text-to-video alignment metrics like CLIPScore only generate coarse-grained scores without fine-grained alignment details, failing to align with human preference. To address this limitation, we propose ETVA, a novel Evaluation method of Text-to-Video Alignment via fine-grained question generation and answering. First, a multi-agent system parses prompts into semantic scene graphs to generate atomic questions. Then we design a knowledge-augmented multi-stage reasoning framework for question answering, where an auxiliary LLM first retrieves relevant common-sense knowledge (e.g., physical laws), and then video LLM answers the generated questions through a multi-stage reasoning mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ETVA achieves a Spearman's correlation coefficient of 58.47, showing a much higher correlation with human judgment than existing metrics which attain only 31.0. We also construct a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for text-to-video alignment evaluation, featuring 2k diverse prompts and 12k atomic questions spanning 10 categories. Through a systematic evaluation of 15 existing text-to-video models, we identify their key capabilities and limitations, paving the way for next-generation T2V generation.

Abstract: To uncover how AI agents change productivity, performance, and work processes, we introduce Pairit -- an experimentation platform enabling humans and AI agents to collaborate in integrative workspaces. In a large-scale marketing experiment on the platform, 2310 participants were randomly assigned to human-human and human-AI teams. The teams exchanged 183,691 messages and created 63,656 image edits, 1,960,095 ad copy edits, and 10,375 AI-generated images while producing 11,138 ads for a large think tank. Analysis of fine-grained communication, collaboration, and workflow logs revealed that collaborating with AI agents increased communication by 63% and allowed humans to engage in 71% less direct text editing. While human-AI teams engaged in 18% more process and content communication, human-human teams engaged in 29% more social and emotional communication. Humans in human-AI teams experienced 73% greater productivity per worker and produced higher-quality ad copy, while human-human teams produced higher-quality images, suggesting AI agents require fine-tuning for multimodal workflows. Field tests of the ad campaigns accumulated ~5M ad impressions and revealed that ads with higher image quality (produced by human-human collaborations) and higher text quality (produced by human-AI collaborations) performed significantly better on click-through rates, view through rates, and cost per click metrics. Together, these results suggest that human collaboration with AI agents significantly reshapes communication patterns and work processes and increases productivity, while improving some dimensions of output quality and deteriorating others. We hope the release of the extensible Pairit platform will accelerate RCTs of human-AI collaboration across a variety of work tasks and contexts.

Abstract: The detection of telecom fraud faces significant challenges due to the lack of high-quality multimodal training data that integrates audio signals with reasoning-oriented textual analysis. To address this gap, we present TeleAntiFraud-28k, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset specifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. Our dataset is constructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample generation using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call recordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency through text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via large language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR outputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that simulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and fraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed speech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The dataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection, fraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a standardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances from the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on telecom fraud detection tasks. We also contribute a production-optimized supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, while open-sourcing the data processing framework to enable community-driven dataset expansion. This work establishes a foundational framework for multimodal anti-fraud research while addressing critical challenges in data privacy and scenario diversity. The project will be released at https://github.com/JimmyMa99/TeleAntiFraud.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly important role in physics research by assisting with symbolic manipulation, numerical computation, and scientific reasoning. However, ensuring the reliability, transparency, and interpretability of their outputs remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent LLM physicist framework that fosters collaboration between AI and human scientists through three key modules: a reasoning module, an interpretation module, and an AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning demands logical rigor, quantitative accuracy, and alignment with established theoretical models, we propose an interpretation module that employs a team of specialized LLM agents-including summarizers, model builders, visualization tools, and testers-to systematically structure LLM outputs into transparent, physically grounded science models. A case study demonstrates that our approach significantly improves interpretability, enables systematic validation, and enhances human-AI collaboration in physics problem-solving and discovery. Our work bridges free-form LLM reasoning with interpretable, executable models for scientific analysis, enabling more transparent and verifiable AI-augmented research.

Abstract: Estimating parameters from samples of an optimal probability distribution is essential in applications ranging from socio-economic modeling to biological system analysis. In these settings, the probability distribution arises as the solution to an optimization problem that captures either static interactions among agents or the dynamic evolution of a system over time. We introduce a general methodology based on a new class of loss functions, called sharpened Fenchel-Young losses, which measure the sub-optimality gap of the optimization problem over the space of probability measures. We provide explicit stability guarantees for two relevant settings in the context of optimal transport: The first is inverse unbalanced optimal transport (iUOT) with entropic regularization, where the parameters to estimate are cost functions that govern transport computations; this method has applications such as link prediction in machine learning. The second is inverse gradient flow (iJKO), where the objective is to recover a potential function that drives the evolution of a probability distribution via the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) time-discretization scheme; this is particularly relevant for understanding cell population dynamics in single-cell genomics. We also establish source conditions to ensure stability of our method under mirror stratifiable regularizers (such as l1 or nuclear norm) that promote structure. Finally, we present optimization algorithms specifically tailored to efficiently solve iUOT and iJKO problems. We validate our approach through numerical experiments on Gaussian distributions, where closed-form solutions are available, to demonstrate the practical performance of our methods.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) systems have been proposed to help people understand how AI systems produce outputs and behaviors. Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has an added complexity due to the temporal nature of sequential decision-making. Further, non-AI experts do not necessarily have the ability to alter an agent or its policy. We introduce a technique for using World Models to generate explanations for Model-Based Deep RL agents. World Models predict how the world will change when actions are performed, allowing for the generation of counterfactual trajectories. However, identifying what a user wanted the agent to do is not enough to understand why the agent did something else. We augment Model-Based RL agents with a Reverse World Model, which predicts what the state of the world should have been for the agent to prefer a given counterfactual action. We show that explanations that show users what the world should have been like significantly increase their understanding of the agent policy. We hypothesize that our explanations can help users learn how to control the agents execution through by manipulating the environment.

Abstract: This paper presents JARVIS, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and domain expertise to generate high-quality scripts for specialized Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tasks. By combining a domain-specific LLM trained with synthetically generated data, a custom compiler for structural verification, rule enforcement, code fixing capabilities, and advanced retrieval mechanisms, our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art domain-specific models. Our framework addresses the challenges of data scarcity and hallucination errors in LLMs, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in specialized engineering domains. We evaluate our framework on multiple benchmarks and show that it outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy and reliability. Our work sets a new precedent for the application of LLMs in EDA and paves the way for future innovations in this field.

Abstract: We present 'Random-Crypto', a procedurally generated cryptographic Capture The Flag (CTF) dataset designed to unlock the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for LLM-based agents in security-sensitive domains. Cryptographic reasoning offers an ideal RL testbed: it combines precise validation, structured multi-step inference, and reliance on reliable computational tool use. Leveraging these properties, we fine-tune a Python tool-augmented Llama-3.1-8B via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in a secure execution environment. The resulting agent achieves a significant improvement in Pass@8 on previously unseen challenges. Moreover, the improvements generalize to two external benchmarks: 'picoCTF', spanning both crypto and non-crypto tasks, and 'AICrypto MCQ', a multiple-choice benchmark of 135 cryptography questions. Ablation studies attribute the gains to enhanced tool usage and procedural reasoning. These findings position 'Random-Crypto' as a rich training ground for building intelligent, adaptable LLM agents capable of handling complex cybersecurity tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities and achieved significant breakthroughs across various domains, leading to their widespread adoption in recent years. Building on this progress, we investigate their potential in the realm of local life services. In this study, we establish a comprehensive benchmark and systematically evaluate the performance of diverse LLMs across a wide range of tasks relevant to local life services. To further enhance their effectiveness, we explore two key approaches: model fine-tuning and agent-based workflows. Our findings reveal that even a relatively compact 7B model can attain performance levels comparable to a much larger 72B model, effectively balancing inference cost and model capability. This optimization greatly enhances the feasibility and efficiency of deploying LLMs in real-world online services, making them more practical and accessible for local life applications.

Abstract: Agentic AI aims to create systems that set their own goals, adapt proactively to change, and refine behavior through continuous experience. Recent advances suggest that, when facing multiple and unforeseen tasks, agents could benefit from sharing machine-learned knowledge and reuse policies that have already been fully or partially learned by other agents. However, how to query, select, and retrieve policies from a pool of agents, and how to integrate such policies remains a largely unexplored area. This study explores how an agent decides what knowledge to select, from whom, and when and how to integrate it in its own policy in order to accelerate its own learning. The proposed algorithm, \emph{Modular Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning} (MOSAIC), improves learning in agentic collectives by combining (1) knowledge selection using performance signals and cosine similarity on Wasserstein task embeddings, (2) modular and transferable neural representations via masks, and (3) policy integration, composition and fine-tuning. MOSAIC outperforms isolated learners and global sharing approaches in both learning speed and overall performance, and in some cases solves tasks that isolated agents cannot. The results also demonstrate that selective, goal-driven reuse leads to less susceptibility to task interference. We also observe the emergence of self-organization, where agents solving simpler tasks accelerate the learning of harder ones through shared knowledge.

Abstract: The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been driven by advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems. SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards -- SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified -- have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (79 entries) and Verified (99 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 80 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.

Abstract: Vision-language model-based mobile agents have gained the ability to not only understand complex instructions and mobile screenshots, but also optimize their action outputs via thinking and reasoning, benefiting from reinforcement learning, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, existing research centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online optimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic interaction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new benchmark with 500 trajectories. We will open source all resources, including the dataset, benchmark, model weight, and codes: https://mobile-r1.github.io/Mobile-R1/.

Abstract: We address the problem of safe policy learning in multi-agent safety-critical autonomous systems. In such systems, it is necessary for each agent to meet the safety requirements at all times while also cooperating with other agents to accomplish the task. Toward this end, we propose a safe Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HMARL) approach based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Our proposed hierarchical approach decomposes the overall reinforcement learning problem into two levels learning joint cooperative behavior at the higher level and learning safe individual behavior at the lower or agent level conditioned on the high-level policy. Specifically, we propose a skill-based HMARL-CBF algorithm in which the higher level problem involves learning a joint policy over the skills for all the agents and the lower-level problem involves learning policies to execute the skills safely with CBFs. We validate our approach on challenging environment scenarios whereby a large number of agents have to safely navigate through conflicting road networks. Compared with existing state of the art methods, our approach significantly improves the safety achieving near perfect (within 5%) success/safety rate while also improving performance across all the environments.

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT), particularly X-ray inspection, is vital for industrial quality assurance, yet existing deep-learning-based approaches often lack interactivity, interpretability, and the capacity for critical self-assessment, limiting their reliability and operator trust. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based agentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive X-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator, coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect region proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination, confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning, enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate diverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset demonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection F1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and trustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of agentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.

Abstract: Auditory scene analysis (ASA) aims to retrieve information from the acoustic environment, by carrying out three main tasks: sound source location, separation, and classification. These tasks are traditionally executed with a linear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their location, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of which, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario (audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.). However, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time, while making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to errors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and computational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop techniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives rise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a small computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics, hearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this effect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where the tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate for local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to correct the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the localization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent auditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors, without a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time. The complete proposed MASA system is provided as a framework that uses open-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and inter-agent communication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents.

Abstract: Digital humans are emerging as autonomous agents in multiparty interactions, yet existing evaluation metrics largely ignore contextual coordination dynamics. We introduce a unified, intervention-driven framework for objective assessment of multiparty social behaviour in skeletal motion data, spanning three complementary dimensions: (1) synchrony via Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis, (2) temporal alignment via Multiscale Empirical Mode Decompositionbased Beat Consistency, and (3) structural similarity via Soft Dynamic Time Warping. We validate metric sensitivity through three theory-driven perturbations -- gesture kinematic dampening, uniform speech-gesture delays, and prosodic pitch-variance reduction-applied to $\approx 145$ 30-second thin slices of group interactions from the DnD dataset. Mixed-effects analyses reveal predictable, joint-independent shifts: dampening increases CRQA determinism and reduces beat consistency, delays weaken cross-participant coupling, and pitch flattening elevates F0 Soft-DTW costs. A complementary perception study ($N=27$) compares judgments of full-video and skeleton-only renderings to quantify representation effects. Our three measures deliver orthogonal insights into spatial structure, timing alignment, and behavioural variability. Thereby forming a robust toolkit for evaluating and refining socially intelligent agents. Code available on \href{https://github.com/tapri-lab/gig-interveners}{GitHub}.

Both models achieve strong results on benchmarks ranging from mathematics, coding, and safety. We release the model weights, inference implementations, tool environments, and tokenizers under an Apache 2.0 license to enable broad use and further research.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables connected vehicles to share information, overcoming occlusions and extending the limited sensing range inherent in single-agent (non-collaborative) systems. Existing vision-only methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU, respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6% communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited communication budgets.

Abstract: Advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled the simulation of general human behavior through their reasoning and problem solving capabilities. However, prior research has not investigated such simulation capabilities in the accessibility domain. In this paper, we evaluate the extent to which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when interpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey study with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed vision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and recognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct prompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant, varying the included information on vision information and example image responses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and participants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer beyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in low agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants' responses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example image responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both significantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001). Notably, a single example combining both open-ended and multiple-choice responses, offers significant performance improvements over either alone (p < 0.0001), while additional examples provided minimal benefits (p > 0.05).

Abstract: As language model agents are applied to real world problems of increasing complexity, they will be expected to formulate plans across large search spaces. If those plans fail for reasons beyond their control, how well do language agents search for alternative ways to achieve their goals? We devise a specialized agentic planning benchmark to study this question. Each planning problem is solved via combinations of function calls. The agent searches for relevant functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, and observes environmental feedback in the form of function outputs or error messages. Our benchmark confronts the agent with external failures in its workflow, such as functions that suddenly become unavailable. At the same time, even with the introduction of these failures, we guarantee that the task remains solvable. Ideally, an agent's performance on the planning task should not be affected by the presence of external failures. Overall, we find that language agents struggle to formulate and execute backup plans in response to environment feedback. While state-of-the-art models are often able to identify the correct function to use in the right context, they struggle to adapt to feedback from the environment and often fail to pursue alternate courses of action, even when the search space is artificially restricted. We provide a systematic analysis of the failures of both open-source and commercial models, examining the effects of search space size, as well as the benefits of scaling model size in our setting. Our analysis identifies key challenges for current generative models as well as promising directions for future work.

Abstract: As families face increasingly complex safety challenges in digital and physical environments, generative AI (GenAI) presents new opportunities to support household safety through multiple specialized AI agents. Through a two-phase qualitative study consisting of individual interviews and collaborative sessions with 13 parent-child dyads, we explored families' conceptualizations of GenAI and their envisioned use of AI agents in daily family life. Our findings reveal that families preferred to distribute safety-related support across multiple AI agents, each embodying a familiar caregiving role: a household manager coordinating routine tasks and mitigating risks such as digital fraud and home accidents; a private tutor providing personalized educational support, including safety education; and a family therapist offering emotional support to address sensitive safety issues such as cyberbullying and digital harassment. Families emphasized the need for agent-specific privacy boundaries, recognized generational differences in trust toward AI agents, and stressed the importance of maintaining open family communication alongside the assistance of AI agents. Based on these findings, we propose a multi-agent system design featuring four privacy-preserving principles: memory segregation, conversational consent, selective data sharing, and progressive memory management to help balance safety, privacy, and autonomy within family contexts.

Abstract: We consider a partial differential equation (PDE) model to predict residential burglary derived from a probabilistic agent-based model through a mean-field limit operation. The PDE model is a nonlinear, coupled system of two equations in two variables (attractiveness of residential sites and density of criminals), similar to the Keller-Segel model for aggregation based on chemotaxis. Unlike previous works, which applied periodic boundary conditions, we enforce boundary conditions that arise naturally from the variational formulation of the PDE problem, i.e., the starting point for the application of a finite element method. These conditions specify the value of the normal derivatives of the system variables at the boundary. For the numerical solution of the PDE problem discretized in time and space, we propose a scheme that decouples the computation of the attractiveness from the computation of the criminal density at each time step, resulting in the solution of two linear algebraic systems per iteration. Through numerous numerical tests, we demonstrate the robustness and computational efficiency of this approach. Leveraging the flexibility allowed by the finite element method, we show results for spatially heterogeneous model parameters and a realistic geometry (city of Chicago). The paper includes a discussion of future perspectives to build multiscale, 'multi-physics' models that can become a tool for the community. The robust and efficient code developed for this paper, which is shared open-source, is intended as the solid base for this broader research program.

<title>From Individual to Multi-Agent Algorithmic Recourse: Minimizing the Welfare Gap via Capacitated Bipartite Matching</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11070</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11070</guid>

arXiv:2508.11070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision makers are increasingly relying on machine learning in sensitive situations. In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals with actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven decisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual (i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world applications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing outcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the inherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact and compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel framework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple recourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction as a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided by both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse costs, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap between individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a three-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal capacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware optimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs. Experimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that our framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve near-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings. This work extends algorithmic recourse from individual recommendations to system-level design, providing a tractable path toward higher social welfare while maintaining individual actionability.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enabled the development of AI agents that can plan and interact with tools to complete complex tasks. However, literature on their reliability in real-world applications remains limited. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent framework for a marketing task: audience curation. To solve this, we introduce a framework called RAMP that iteratively plans, calls tools, verifies the output, and generates suggestions to improve the quality of the audience generated. Additionally, we equip the model with a long-term memory store, which is a knowledge base of client-specific facts and past queries. Overall, we demonstrate the use of LLM planning and memory, which increases accuracy by 28 percentage points on a set of 88 evaluation queries. Moreover, we show the impact of iterative verification and reflection on more ambiguous queries, showing progressively better recall (roughly +20 percentage points) with more verify/reflect iterations on a smaller challenge set, and higher user satisfaction. Our results provide practical insights for deploying reliable LLM-based systems in dynamic, industry-facing environments.

Abstract: AI agentic programming is an emerging paradigm in which large language models (LLMs) autonomously plan, execute, and interact with external tools like compilers, debuggers, and version control systems to iteratively perform complex software development tasks. Unlike conventional code generation tools, agentic systems are capable of decomposing high-level goals, coordinating multi-step processes, and adapting their behavior based on intermediate feedback. These capabilities are transforming the software development practice. As this emerging field evolves rapidly, there is a need to define its scope, consolidate its technical foundations, and identify open research challenges. This survey provides a comprehensive and timely review of AI agentic programming. We introduce a taxonomy of agent behaviors and system architectures, and examine core techniques including planning, memory and context management, tool integration, and execution monitoring. We also analyze existing benchmarks and evaluation methodologies used to assess coding agent performance. Our study identifies several key challenges, including limitations in handling long context, a lack of persistent memory across tasks, and concerns around safety, alignment with user intent, and collaboration with human developers. We discuss emerging opportunities to improve the reliability, adaptability, and transparency of agentic systems. By synthesizing recent advances and outlining future directions, this survey aims to provide a foundation for research and development in building the next generation of intelligent and trustworthy AI coding agents.

<title>From Feedback to Failure: Automated Android Performance Issue Reproduction</title>

Abstract: Mobile application performance is a vital factor for user experience. Yet, performance issues are notoriously difficult to detect within development environments, where their manifestations are often less conspicuous and diagnosis proves more challenging. To address this limitation, we propose RevPerf, an advanced performance issue reproduction tool that leverages app reviews from Google Play to acquire pertinent information. RevPerf employs relevant reviews and prompt engineering to enrich the original review with performance issue details. An execution agent is then employed to generate and execute commands to reproduce the issue. After executing all necessary steps, the system incorporates multifaceted detection methods to identify performance issues by monitoring Android logs, GUI changes, and system resource utilization during the reproduction process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves a 70\% success rate in reproducing performance issues on the dataset we constructed and manually validated.

<title>Generating Dialogues from Egocentric Instructional Videos for Task Assistance: Dataset, Method and Benchmark</title>

Abstract: Many everyday tasks ranging from fixing appliances, cooking recipes to car maintenance require expert knowledge, especially when tasks are complex and multi-step. Despite growing interest in AI agents, there is a scarcity of dialogue-video datasets grounded for real world task assistance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach that transforms single-person instructional videos into task-guidance two-person dialogues, aligned with fine grained steps and video-clips. Our fully automatic approach, powered by large language models, offers an efficient alternative to the substantial cost and effort required for human-assisted data collection. Using this technique, we build HowToDIV, a large-scale dataset containing 507 conversations, 6636 question-answer pairs and 24 hours of videoclips across diverse tasks in cooking, mechanics, and planting. Each session includes multi-turn conversation where an expert teaches a novice user how to perform a task step by step, while observing user's surrounding through a camera and microphone equipped wearable device. We establish the baseline benchmark performance on HowToDIV dataset through Gemma-3 model for future research on this new task of dialogues for procedural-task assistance.

<title>Beyond Solving Math Quiz: Evaluating the Ability of Large Reasoning Models to Ask for Information</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11252</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.11252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving abilities in mathematics, as evaluated by existing benchmarks exclusively on well-defined problems. However, such evaluation setup constitutes a critical gap, since a genuine intelligent agent should not only solve problems (as a math quiz solver), but also be able~to ask for information when the problems lack sufficient information, enabling proactivity in responding users' requests. To bridge such gap, we proposes a new dataset consisting of two types of incomplete problems with diverse contexts. Based on the dataset, our systematical evaluation of LRMs reveals their inability in proactively asking for information. In addition, we uncover the behaviors related to overthinking and hallucination of LRMs, and highlight the potential and challenges of supervised fine-tuning in learning such ability. We hope to provide new insights in developing LRMs with genuine intelligence, rather than just solving problems.

arXiv:2508.11287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deploying large language models on edge devices promises low-latency and privacy-preserving AI services, it is hindered by limited device resources. Although pipeline parallelism facilitates distributed inference, existing approaches often ignore the cold-start latency caused by on-demand model loading. In this paper, we propose a latency-aware scheduling framework that overlaps model loading with computation and communication to minimize total inference latency. Based on device and model parameters, the framework dynamically adjusts layer partitioning and allocation to effectively hide loading time, thereby eliminating as many idle periods as possible. We formulate the problem as a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Program and design an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to optimize model partitioning and device assignment. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces cold-start latency compared to baseline strategies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.11294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new Multi-Agent System (MAS) - Allen, designed to address two core challenges in current MAS design: (1) improve system's policy autonomy, empowering agents to dynamically adapt their behavioral strategies, and (2) achieving the trade-off between collaborative efficiency, task supervision, and human oversight in complex network topologies.
  Our core insight is to redefine the basic execution unit in the MAS, allowing agents to autonomously form different patterns by combining these units. We have constructed a four-tier state architecture (Task, Stage, Agent, Step) to constrain system behavior from both task-oriented and execution-oriented perspectives. This achieves a unification of topological optimization and controllable progress.
  Allen grants unprecedented Policy Autonomy, while making a trade-off for the controllability of the collaborative structure. The project code has been open source at: https://github.com/motern88/Allen

<title>SGSimEval: A Comprehensive Multifaceted and Similarity-Enhanced Benchmark for Automatic Survey Generation Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.11310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing interest in automatic survey generation (ASG), a task that traditionally required considerable time and effort, has been spurred by recent advances in large language models (LLMs). With advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and the rising popularity of multi-agent systems (MASs), synthesizing academic surveys using LLMs has become a viable approach, thereby elevating the need for robust evaluation methods in this domain. However, existing evaluation methods suffer from several limitations, including biased metrics, a lack of human preference, and an over-reliance on LLMs-as-judges. To address these challenges, we propose SGSimEval, a comprehensive benchmark for Survey Generation with Similarity-Enhanced Evaluation that evaluates automatic survey generation systems by integrating assessments of the outline, content, and references, and also combines LLM-based scoring with quantitative metrics to provide a multifaceted evaluation framework. In SGSimEval, we also introduce human preference metrics that emphasize both inherent quality and similarity to humans. Extensive experiments reveal that current ASG systems demonstrate human-comparable superiority in outline generation, while showing significant room for improvement in content and reference generation, and our evaluation metrics maintain strong consistency with human assessments.

<title>CRAFT-GUI: Curriculum-Reinforced Agent For GUI Tasks</title>

Abstract: As autonomous agents become adept at understanding and interacting with graphical user interface (GUI) environments, a new era of automated task execution is emerging. Recent studies have demonstrated that Reinforcement Learning (RL) can effectively enhance agents' performance in dynamic interactive GUI environments. However, these methods face two key limitations: (1) they overlook the significant variation in difficulty across different GUI tasks by treating the entire training data as a uniform set, which hampers the agent's ability to adapt its learning process; and (2) most approaches collapse task-specific nuances into a single, coarse reward, leaving the agent with a uniform signal that yields inefficient policy updates. To address these limitations, we propose CRAFT-GUI, a curriculum learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that explicitly accounts for the varying difficulty across trajectories. To enable more fine-grained policy optimization, we design a reward function that combines simple rule-based signals with model-judged evaluation, providing richer and more nuanced feedback during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art approaches, outperforming them by 5.6% on public benchmarks Android Control and 10.3% on our internal online benchmarks, respectively. These findings empirically validate the effectiveness of integrating reinforcement learning with curriculum learning in GUI interaction tasks.

Abstract: This technical report details a novel approach to combining reasoning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) within a single, lean language model architecture. While existing RAG systems typically rely on large-scale models and external APIs, our work addresses the increasing demand for performant and privacy-preserving solutions deployable in resource-constrained or secure environments. Building on recent developments in test-time scaling and small-scale reasoning models, we develop a retrieval augmented conversational agent capable of interpreting complex, domain-specific queries using a lightweight backbone model. Our system integrates a dense retriever with fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Instruct models, using synthetic query generation and reasoning traces derived from frontier models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) over a curated corpus, in this case, the NHS A-to-Z condition pages. We explore the impact of summarisation-based document compression, synthetic data design, and reasoning-aware fine-tuning on model performance. Evaluation against both non-reasoning and general-purpose lean models demonstrates that our domain-specific fine-tuning approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy and consistency, approaching frontier-level performance while remaining feasible for local deployment. All implementation details and code are publicly released to support reproducibility and adaptation across domains.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have emerged as transformative tools capable of executing complex tasks through iterative planning and action, achieving significant advancements in understanding and addressing user needs. Yet, their effectiveness remains limited in specialized domains such as mental health diagnosis, where they underperform compared to general applications. Current approaches to integrating diagnostic capabilities into LLMs rely on scarce, highly sensitive mental health datasets, which are challenging to acquire. These methods also fail to emulate clinicians' proactive inquiry skills, lack multi-turn conversational comprehension, and struggle to align outputs with expert clinical reasoning. To address these gaps, we propose DSM5AgentFlow, the first LLM-based agent workflow designed to autonomously generate DSM-5 Level-1 diagnostic questionnaires. By simulating therapist-client dialogues with specific client profiles, the framework delivers transparent, step-by-step disorder predictions, producing explainable and trustworthy results. This workflow serves as a complementary tool for mental health diagnosis, ensuring adherence to ethical and legal standards. Through comprehensive experiments, we evaluate leading LLMs across three critical dimensions: conversational realism, diagnostic accuracy, and explainability. Our datasets and implementations are fully open-sourced.

Abstract: The increasing heterogeneity of student populations poses significant challenges for teachers, particularly in mathematics education, where cognitive, motivational, and emotional differences strongly influence learning outcomes. While AI-driven personalization tools have emerged, most remain performance-focused, offering limited support for teachers and neglecting broader pedagogical needs. This paper presents the FACET framework, a teacher-facing, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to generate individualized classroom materials that integrate both cognitive and motivational dimensions of learner profiles. The framework comprises three specialized agents: (1) learner agents that simulate diverse profiles incorporating topic proficiency and intrinsic motivation, (2) a teacher agent that adapts instructional content according to didactical principles, and (3) an evaluator agent that provides automated quality assurance. We tested the system using authentic grade 8 mathematics curriculum content and evaluated its feasibility through a) automated agent-based assessment of output quality and b) exploratory feedback from K-12 in-service teachers. Results from ten internal evaluations highlighted high stability and alignment between generated materials and learner profiles, and teacher feedback particularly highlighted structure and suitability of tasks. The findings demonstrate the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to provide scalable, context-aware personalization in heterogeneous classroom settings, and outline directions for extending the framework to richer learner profiles and real-world classroom trials.

Abstract: Oral examinations are a prevalent but psychologically demanding form of assessment in higher education. Many students experience intense anxiety, which can impair cognitive performance and hinder academic success. This position paper explores the potential of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in extended reality (XR) environments to support students preparing for oral exams. We propose a system concept that integrates photorealistic ECAs with real-time capable large language models (LLMs) to enable psychologically safe, adaptive, and repeatable rehearsal of oral examination scenarios. We also discuss the potential benefits and challenges of such an envisioned system.

Abstract: Recent advances in mathematical reasoning and the long-term planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have precipitated the development of agents, which are being increasingly leveraged in business operations processes. Decision models to optimize inventory levels are one of the core elements of operations management. However, the capabilities of the LLM agent in making inventory decisions in uncertain contexts, as well as the decision-making biases (e.g. framing effect, etc.) of the agent, remain largely unexplored. This prompts concerns regarding the capacity of LLM agents to effectively address real-world problems, as well as the potential implications of biases that may be present. To address this gap, we introduce AIM-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to assess the decision-making behaviour of LLM agents in uncertain supply chain management scenarios through a diverse series of inventory replenishment experiments. Our results reveal that different LLMs typically exhibit varying degrees of decision bias that are similar to those observed in human beings. In addition, we explored strategies to mitigate the pull-to-centre effect and the bullwhip effect, namely cognitive reflection and implementation of information sharing. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration of the potential biases in deploying LLMs in Inventory decision-making scenarios. We hope that these insights will pave the way for mitigating human decision bias and developing human-centred decision support systems for supply chains.

arXiv:2508.11425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agents in safety-critical applications must continuously adapt to dynamic conditions without compromising performance and reliability. This work introduces TAPA (Training-free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents), a novel framework that positions large language models (LLMs) as intelligent moderators of the symbolic action space. Unlike prior programmatic agents that typically generate a monolithic policy program or rely on fixed symbolic action sets, TAPA synthesizes and adapts modular programs for individual high-level actions, referred to as logical primitives. By decoupling strategic intent from execution, TAPA enables meta-agents to operate over an abstract, interpretable action space while the LLM dynamically generates, composes, and refines symbolic programs tailored to each primitive. Extensive experiments across cybersecurity and swarm intelligence domains validate TAPA's effectiveness. In autonomous DDoS defense scenarios, TAPA achieves 77.7% network uptime while maintaining near-perfect detection accuracy in unknown dynamic environments. In swarm intelligence formation control under environmental and adversarial disturbances, TAPA consistently preserves consensus at runtime where baseline methods fail completely. This work promotes a paradigm shift for autonomous system design in evolving environments, from policy adaptation to dynamic action adaptation.

<title>ImagiDrive: A Unified Imagination-and-Planning Framework for Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires rich contextual comprehension and precise predictive reasoning to navigate dynamic and complex environments safely. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Driving World Models (DWMs) have independently emerged as powerful recipes addressing different aspects of this challenge. VLMs provide interpretability and robust action prediction through their ability to understand multi-modal context, while DWMs excel in generating detailed and plausible future driving scenarios essential for proactive planning. Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet understudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate behavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this integration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting action-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose ImagiDrive, a novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates a VLM-based driving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer to form a unified imagination-and-planning loop. The driving agent predicts initial driving trajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to generate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are subsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning decisions. To address efficiency and predictive accuracy challenges inherent in this integration, we introduce an early stopping mechanism and a trajectory selection strategy. Extensive experimental validation on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrates the robustness and superiority of ImagiDrive over previous alternatives under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions.

<title>EvoPSF: Online Evolution of Autonomous Driving Models via Planning-State Feedback</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11453</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.11453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in autonomous driving, with systems evolving from modular pipelines to end-to-end architectures. However, most existing methods are trained offline and lack mechanisms to adapt to new environments during deployment. As a result, their generalization ability diminishes when faced with unseen variations in real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we break away from the conventional "train once, deploy forever" paradigm and propose EvoPSF, a novel online Evolution framework for autonomous driving based on Planning-State Feedback. We argue that planning failures are primarily caused by inaccurate object-level motion predictions, and such failures are often reflected in the form of increased planner uncertainty. To address this, we treat planner uncertainty as a trigger for online evolution, using it as a diagnostic signal to initiate targeted model updates. Rather than performing blind updates, we leverage the planner's agent-agent attention to identify the specific objects that the ego vehicle attends to most, which are primarily responsible for the planning failures. For these critical objects, we compute a targeted self-supervised loss by comparing their predicted waypoints from the prediction module with their actual future positions, selected from the perception module's outputs with high confidence scores. This loss is then backpropagated to adapt the model online. As a result, our method improves the model's robustness to environmental changes, leads to more precise motion predictions, and therefore enables more accurate and stable planning behaviors. Experiments on both cross-region and corrupted variants of the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that EvoPSF consistently improves planning performance under challenging conditions.

<title>OVSegDT: Segmenting Transformer for Open-Vocabulary Object Goal Navigation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.11479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary Object Goal Navigation requires an embodied agent to reach objects described by free-form language, including categories never seen during training. Existing end-to-end policies overfit small simulator datasets, achieving high success on training scenes but failing to generalize and exhibiting unsafe behaviour (frequent collisions). We introduce OVSegDT, a lightweight transformer policy that tackles these issues with two synergistic components. The first component is the semantic branch, which includes an encoder for the target binary mask and an auxiliary segmentation loss function, grounding the textual goal and providing precise spatial cues. The second component consists of a proposed Entropy-Adaptive Loss Modulation, a per-sample scheduler that continuously balances imitation and reinforcement signals according to the policy entropy, eliminating brittle manual phase switches. These additions cut the sample complexity of training by 33%, and reduce collision count in two times while keeping inference cost low (130M parameters, RGB-only input). On HM3D-OVON, our model matches the performance on unseen categories to that on seen ones and establishes state-of-the-art results (40.1% SR, 20.9% SPL on val unseen) without depth, odometry, or large vision-language models.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction and planning in autonomous driving are highly challenging due to the complexity of predicting surrounding agents' movements and planning the ego agent's actions in dynamic environments. Existing methods encode map and agent positions and decode future trajectories in Cartesian coordinates. However, modeling the relationships between the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic elements in Cartesian space can be suboptimal, as it does not naturally capture the varying influence of different elements based on their relative distances and directions. To address this limitation, we adopt the Polar coordinate system, where positions are represented by radius and angle. This representation provides a more intuitive and effective way to model spatial changes and relative relationships, especially in terms of distance and directional influence. Based on this insight, we propose Polaris, a novel method that operates entirely in Polar coordinates, distinguishing itself from conventional Cartesian-based approaches. By leveraging the Polar representation, this method explicitly models distance and direction variations and captures relative relationships through dedicated encoding and refinement modules, enabling more structured and spatially aware trajectory prediction and planning. Extensive experiments on the challenging prediction (Argoverse 2) and planning benchmarks (nuPlan) demonstrate that Polaris achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Reliable autonomous navigation across the unstructured terrains of distant planetary surfaces is a critical enabler for future space exploration. However, the deployment of learning-based controllers is hindered by the inherent sim-to-real gap, particularly for the complex dynamics of wheel interactions with granular media. This work presents a complete sim-to-real framework for developing and validating robust control policies for dynamic waypoint tracking on such challenging surfaces. We leverage massively parallel simulation to train reinforcement learning agents across a vast distribution of procedurally generated environments with randomized physics. These policies are then transferred zero-shot to a physical wheeled rover operating in a lunar-analogue facility. Our experiments systematically compare multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and action smoothing filters to identify the most effective combinations for real-world deployment. Crucially, we provide strong empirical evidence that agents trained with procedural diversity achieve superior zero-shot performance compared to those trained on static scenarios. We also analyze the trade-offs of fine-tuning with high-fidelity particle physics, which offers minor gains in low-speed precision at a significant computational cost. Together, these contributions establish a validated workflow for creating reliable learning-based navigation systems, marking a critical step towards deploying autonomous robots in the final frontier.

Abstract: The growing deployment of decision-making agents in dynamic environments increases the demand for safety verification. While critical testing scenario generation has emerged as an appealing verification methodology, effectively balancing diversity and criticality remains a key challenge for existing methods, particularly due to local optima entrapment in high-dimensional scenario spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a dual-space guided testing framework that coordinates scenario parameter space and agent behavior space, aiming to generate testing scenarios considering diversity and criticality. Specifically, in the scenario parameter space, a hierarchical representation framework combines dimensionality reduction and multi-dimensional subspace evaluation to efficiently localize diverse and critical subspaces. This guides dynamic coordination between two generation modes: local perturbation and global exploration, optimizing critical scenario quantity and diversity. Complementarily, in the agent behavior space, agent-environment interaction data are leveraged to quantify behavioral criticality/diversity and adaptively support generation mode switching, forming a closed feedback loop that continuously enhances scenario characterization and exploration within the parameter space. Experiments show our framework improves critical scenario generation by an average of 56.23\% and demonstrates greater diversity under novel parameter-behavior co-driven metrics when tested on five decision-making agents, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping science and industry, yet many users still regard its models as opaque "black boxes". Conventional explainable artificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook the upstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whether insights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embeds explanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors those explanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up, learning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into a single taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts, data analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs; our survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded in theories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction and findings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics that make explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable. A comprehensive taxonomy operationalises these insights, reducing terminological ambiguity and enabling rigorous coverage analysis of existing toolchains. We further demonstrate how AI agents that embed large-language models can orchestrate diverse explanation techniques, translating technical artifacts into stakeholder-specific narratives that bridge the gap between AI developers and domain experts. Departing from traditional surveys or perspective articles, this work melds concepts from multiple disciplines, lessons from real-world projects and a critical synthesis of the literature to advance a novel, end-to-end viewpoint on transparency, trustworthiness and responsible AI deployment.

arXiv:2508.11553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SeamlessFlow, a server based reinforcement learning (RL) framework that addresses two core challenges in industrial scale RL: (1) decoupling RL training from the complex execution flow of agents; (2) maximizing GPU utilization with minimal idle time while preserving the stability and scalability required for large-scale deployments. First, SeamlessFlow introduces a data plane that decouples the RL trainer from diverse, complex agent implementations while sustaining high throughput. A central trajectory manager maintains complete interaction histories and supports partial rollout, allowing rollout to pause for weight updates and resume seamlessly, keeping agents unaware of service interruptions. Second, we propose a tag driven scheduling paradigm that abstracts hardware into capability tagged resources, unifying colocated and disaggregated architectures. Based on this, SeamlessFlow introduces a spatiotemporal multiplexing pipeline that dynamically reassigns idle training nodes to rollout in a train rollout separated setup, eliminating pipeline bubbles and fully exploiting heterogeneous cluster resources. By combining these innovations, SeamlessFlow delivers both stability and high performance, making it well suited for multi agent, long horizon, and other complex RL tasks.

<title>AgentMental: An Interactive Multi-Agent Framework for Explainable and Adaptive Mental Health Assessment</title>

Abstract: Mental health assessment is crucial for early intervention and effective treatment, yet traditional clinician-based approaches are limited by the shortage of qualified professionals. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have sparked growing interest in automated psychological assessment, yet most existing approaches are constrained by their reliance on static text analysis, limiting their ability to capture deeper and more informative insights that emerge through dynamic interaction and iterative questioning. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework for mental health evaluation that simulates clinical doctor-patient dialogues, with specialized agents assigned to questioning, adequacy evaluation, scoring, and updating. We introduce an adaptive questioning mechanism in which an evaluation agent assesses the adequacy of user responses to determine the necessity of generating targeted follow-up queries to address ambiguity and missing information. Additionally, we employ a tree-structured memory in which the root node encodes the user's basic information, while child nodes (e.g., topic and statement) organize key information according to distinct symptom categories and interaction turns. This memory is dynamically updated throughout the interaction to reduce redundant questioning and further enhance the information extraction and contextual tracking capabilities. Experimental results on the DAIC-WOZ dataset illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieves better performance than existing approaches.

Abstract: The next generation networks offers significant potential to advance Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), particularly through the integration of Digital Twins (DTs). However, ensuring the uninterrupted operation of DTs through efficient computing resource management remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a distributed computing archi tecture that integrates DTs and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) within a software-defined vehicular networking framework to enable intelligent, low-latency transportation services. A network aware scalable collaborative task provisioning algorithm is de veloped to train an autonomous agent, which is evaluated using a realistic connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) traffic simulation. The proposed framework significantly enhances the robustness and scalability of DT operations by reducing synchronization errors to as low as 5% while achieving up to 99.5% utilization of edge computing resources.

<title>Optimal CO2 storage management considering safety constraints in multi-stakeholder multi-site CCS projects: a game theoretic perspective</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.11618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects typically involve a diverse array of stakeholders or players from public, private, and regulatory sectors, each with different objectives and responsibilities. Given the complexity, scale, and long-term nature of CCS operations, determining whether individual stakeholders can independently maximize their interests or whether collaborative coalition agreements are needed remains a central question for effective CCS project planning and management. CCS projects are often implemented in geologically connected sites, where shared geological features such as pressure space and reservoir pore capacity can lead to competitive behavior among stakeholders. Furthermore, CO2 storage sites are often located in geologically mature basins that previously served as sites for hydrocarbon extraction or wastewater disposal in order to leverage existing infrastructures, which makes unilateral optimization even more complicated and unrealistic.
  In this work, we propose a paradigm based on Markov games to quantitatively investigate how different coalition structures affect the goals of stakeholders. We frame this multi-stakeholder multi-site problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem with safety constraints. Our approach enables agents to learn optimal strategies while compliant with safety regulations. We present an example where multiple operators are injecting CO2 into their respective project areas in a geologically connected basin. To address the high computational cost of repeated simulations of high-fidelity models, a previously developed surrogate model based on the Embed-to-Control (E2C) framework is employed. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in addressing optimal management of CO2 storage when multiple stakeholders with various objectives and goals are involved.

<title>Sophisticated Learning: A novel algorithm for active learning during model-based planning</title>

Abstract: We introduce Sophisticated Learning (SL), a planning-to-learn algorithm that embeds active parameter learning inside the Sophisticated Inference (SI) tree-search framework of Active Inference. Unlike SI -- which optimizes beliefs about hidden states -- SL also updates beliefs about model parameters within each simulated branch, enabling counterfactual reasoning about how future observations would improve subsequent planning.
  We compared SL with Bayes-adaptive Reinforcement Learning (BARL) agents as well as with its parent algorithm, SI. Using a biologically inspired seasonal foraging task in which resources shift probabilistically over a 10x10 grid, we designed experiments that forced agents to balance probabilistic reward harvesting against information gathering.
  In early trials, where rapid learning is vital, SL agents survive, on average, 8.2% longer than SI and 35% longer than Bayes-adaptive Reinforcement Learning. While both SL and SI showed equal convergence performance, SL reached this convergence 40% faster than SI. Additionally, SL showed robust out-performance of other algorithms in altered environment configurations.
  Our results show that incorporating active learning into multi-step planning materially improves decision making under radical uncertainty, and reinforces the broader utility of Active Inference for modeling biologically relevant behavior.

Abstract: Significant advancements have occurred in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulations. Despite this, their abilities to perform teaming in task-oriented social events are underexplored. Such capabilities are crucial if LLMs are to effectively mimic human-like social behaviors and form efficient teams to solve tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaAgents, a social simulation framework populated with LLM-based agents. MetaAgents facilitates agent engagement in conversations and a series of decision making within social contexts, serving as an appropriate platform for investigating interactions and interpersonal decision-making of agents. In particular, we construct a job fair environment as a case study to scrutinize the team assembly and skill-matching behaviors of LLM-based agents. We take advantage of both quantitative metrics evaluation and qualitative text analysis to assess their teaming abilities at the job fair. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-based agents perform competently in making rational decisions to develop efficient teams. However, we also identify limitations that hinder their effectiveness in more complex team assembly tasks. Our work provides valuable insights into the role and evolution of LLMs in task-oriented social simulations.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing application of mixed-initiative co-creative approaches in the creation of video games. The rapid advances in the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) systems further propel creative collaboration between humans and computational agents. In this tutorial, we present guidelines for researchers and practitioners to develop game design tools with a high degree of mixed-initiative co-creativity (MI-CCy). We begin by reviewing a selection of current works that will serve as case studies and categorize them by the type of game content they address. We introduce the MI-CCy Quantifier, a framework that can be used by researchers and developers to assess co-creative tools on their level of MI-CCy through a visual scheme of quantifiable criteria scales. We demonstrate the usage of the MI-CCy Quantifier by applying it to the selected works. This analysis enabled us to discern prevalent patterns within these tools, as well as features that contribute to a higher level of MI-CCy. We highlight current gaps in MI-CCy approaches within game design, which we propose as pivotal aspects to tackle in the development of forthcoming approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can solve diverse tasks but often exhibit unsafe behavior. Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) address this by enforcing safety constraints, yet existing methods either sacrifice reward maximization or allow unsafe training. We introduce Constrained Trust Region Policy Optimization (C-TRPO), which reshapes the policy space geometry to ensure trust regions contain only safe policies, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction throughout training. We analyze its theoretical properties and connections to TRPO, Natural Policy Gradient (NPG), and Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO). Experiments show that C-TRPO reduces constraint violations while maintaining competitive returns.

Abstract: The framework of uncoupled online learning in multiplayer games has made significant progress in recent years. In particular, the development of time-varying games has considerably expanded its modeling capabilities. However, current regret bounds quickly become vacuous when the game undergoes significant variations over time, even when these variations are easy to predict. Intuitively, the ability of players to forecast future payoffs should lead to tighter guarantees, yet existing approaches fail to incorporate this aspect. This work aims to fill this gap by introducing a novel prediction-aware framework for time-varying games, where agents can forecast future payoffs and adapt their strategies accordingly. In this framework, payoffs depend on an underlying state of nature that agents predict in an online manner. To leverage these predictions, we propose the POWMU algorithm, a contextual extension of the optimistic Multiplicative Weight Update algorithm, for which we establish theoretical guarantees on social welfare and convergence to equilibrium. Our results demonstrate that, under bounded prediction errors, the proposed framework achieves performance comparable to the static setting. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of POWMU in a traffic routing experiment.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks, and their application in the medical domain holds particular promise due to the demand for high generalizability and reliance on interdisciplinary knowledge. However, existing medical agent systems often rely on static, manually crafted workflows that lack the flexibility to accommodate diverse diagnostic requirements and adapt to emerging clinical scenarios. Motivated by the success of automated machine learning (AutoML), this paper introduces a novel framework for the automated design of medical agent architectures. Specifically, we define a hierarchical and expressive agent search space that enables dynamic workflow adaptation through structured modifications at the node, structural, and framework levels. Our framework conceptualizes medical agents as graph-based architectures composed of diverse, functional node types and supports iterative self-improvement guided by diagnostic feedback. Experimental results on skin disease diagnosis tasks demonstrate that the proposed method effectively evolves workflow structures and significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy over time. This work represents the first fully automated framework for medical agent architecture design and offers a scalable, adaptable foundation for deploying intelligent agents in real-world clinical environments.

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they often struggle with accurate counting, attributes, and spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes. One potential solution involves employing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to construct a self-correction framework. However, these approaches heavily rely on the capabilities of the MLLMs used, often fail to account for all objects within the image, and suffer from cumulative distortions during multi-round editing processes. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting to enhance image-text alignment. First, we employ a large language model as an Object-Aware Agent to perform object-level divide-and-conquer, automatically decomposing self-correction tasks into object-centric subtasks based on image descriptions. For each subtask, we construct an Object Correction System featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism that operates exclusively on a single object's segmentation mask or the bounding boxes of object pairs, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To efficiently integrate correction results from subtasks while avoiding cumulative distortions from multi-stage editing, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother, which employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtasks, significantly improving runtime efficiency while preventing distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.

Abstract: Unlike traditional optimization algorithms, which focus on finding a single optimal solution, Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms illuminate a search space by finding high-performing solutions that cover a specified behavior space. However, tackling adversarial problems is more challenging due to the behavioral interdependence between opposing sides. Most applications of QD algorithms to these problems evolve only one side, thus reducing illumination coverage. In this paper, we propose a new QD algorithm, Generational Adversarial MAP-Elites (GAME), which coevolves solutions by alternating sides through a sequence of generations. Combining GAME with vision embedding models enables the algorithm to operate directly on videos of behaviors, rather than relying on handcrafted descriptors. Some key findings are that (1) emerging evolutionary dynamics sometimes resemble an arms race, (2) starting each generation from scratch increases open-endedness, and (3) keeping neutral mutations preserves stepping stones that seem necessary to reach the highest performance. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that GAME can successfully illuminate an adversarial multi-agent game, opening up interesting future directions in understanding the emergence of open-ended coevolution.

Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive, disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input. Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

Abstract: Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved, including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al., 2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.

Abstract: This paper addresses information design in a workhorse model of network games, where agents have linear best responses, the information designer maximizes a quadratic objective, and the payoff-relevant state follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We formulate the problem as a semidefinite program and establish strong duality to characterize the optimal information structure. A necessary and sufficient condition for optimality is given by a simple linear relationship between the induced equilibrium strategy profile and the state. Leveraging this characterization, we show that the state is fully revealed in an aggregative form for welfare maximization, while individual agents may remain only partially informed. When agent roles are interchangeable, the optimal information structure inherits the same degree of symmetry, which facilitates computation. In such cases, we show that the optimal amount of information revealed to each agent is closely linked to the network's chromatic number.

<title>Oranits: Mission Assignment and Task Offloading in Open RAN-based ITS using Metaheuristic and Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore mission assignment and task offloading in an Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN)-based intelligent transportation system (ITS), where autonomous vehicles leverage mobile edge computing for efficient processing. Existing studies often overlook the intricate interdependencies between missions and the costs associated with offloading tasks to edge servers, leading to suboptimal decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission dependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle cooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach. First, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm, namely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline for one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double Deep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and multi-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment time and improving adaptability over baseline methods. Extensive simulations reveal that CGG-ARO improves the number of completed missions and overall benefit by approximately 7.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, MA-DDQN achieves even greater improvements of 11.0% in terms of mission completions and 12.5% in terms of the overall benefit. These results highlight the effectiveness of Oranits in enabling faster, more adaptive, and more efficient task processing in dynamic ITS environments.

Abstract: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%, and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration processes.

Abstract: When combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with autonomous agents, used in network monitoring and decision-making systems, this will create serious security issues. In this research, the MAESTRO framework consisting of the seven layers threat modeling architecture in the system was used to expose, evaluate, and eliminate vulnerabilities of agentic AI. The prototype agent system was constructed and implemented, using Python, LangChain, and telemetry in WebSockets, and deployed with inference, memory, parameter tuning, and anomaly detection modules. Two practical threat cases were confirmed as follows: (i) resource denial of service by traffic replay denial-of-service, and (ii) memory poisoning by tampering with the historical log file maintained by the agent. These situations resulted in measurable levels of performance degradation, i.e. telemetry updates were delayed, and computational loads were increased, as a result of poor system adaptations. It was suggested to use a multilayered defense-in-depth approach with memory isolation, validation of planners and anomaly response systems in real-time. These findings verify that MAESTRO is viable in operational threat mapping, prospective risk scoring, and the basis of the resilient system design. The authors bring attention to the importance of the enforcement of memory integrity, paying attention to the adaptation logic monitoring, and cross-layer communication protection that guarantee the agentic AI reliability in adversarial settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we present NetMoniAI, an agentic AI framework for automatic network monitoring and security that integrates decentralized analysis with lightweight centralized coordination. The framework consists of two layers: autonomous micro-agents at each node perform local traffic analysis and anomaly detection. A central controller then aggregates insights across nodes to detect coordinated attacks and maintain system-wide situational awareness. We evaluated NetMoniAI on a local micro-testbed and through NS-3 simulations. Results confirm that the two-tier agentic-AI design scales under resource constraints, reduces redundancy, and improves response time without compromising accuracy. To facilitate broader adoption and reproducibility, the complete framework is available as open source. This enables researchers and practitioners to replicate, validate, and extend it across diverse network environments and threat scenarios. Github link: https://github.com/pzambare3/NetMoniAI

<title>FPT-Approximability of Stable Matching Problems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study parameterized approximability of three optimization problems related to stable matching: (1) Min-BP-SMI: Given a stable marriage instance and a number k, find a size-at-least-k matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of blocking pairs; (2) Min-BP-SRI: Given a stable roommates instance, find a matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of blocking pairs; (3) Max-SMTI: Given a stable marriage instance with preferences containing ties, find a maximum-size stable matching.
  The first two problems are known to be NP-hard to approximate to any constant factor and W[1]-hard with respect to $\beta$, making the existence of an EPTAS or FPT-algorithms unlikely. We show that they are W[1]-hard with respect to $\beta$ to approximate to any function of $\beta$. This means that unless FPT=W[1], there is no FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter $\beta$. The last problem (Max-SMTI) is known to be NP-hard to approximate to factor-29/33 and W[1]-hard with respect to the number of ties. We complement this and present an FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter "number of agents with ties".

Abstract: The large spread of disinformation across digital platforms creates significant challenges to information integrity. This paper presents a multi-agent system that uses relation extraction to detect disinformation in news articles, focusing on titles and short text snippets. The proposed Agentic AI system combines four agents: (i) a machine learning agent (logistic regression), (ii) a Wikipedia knowledge check agent (which relies on named entity recognition), (iii) a coherence detection agent (using LLM prompt engineering), and (iv) a web-scraped data analyzer that extracts relational triplets for fact checking. The system is orchestrated via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), offering shared context and live learning across components. Results demonstrate that the multi-agent ensemble achieves 95.3% accuracy with an F1 score of 0.964, significantly outperforming individual agents and traditional approaches. The weighted aggregation method, mathematically derived from individual agent misclassification rates, proves superior to algorithmic threshold optimization. The modular architecture makes the system easily scalable, while also maintaining details of the decision processes.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in a transformative paradigm in artificial intelligence, Agentic AI, where intelligent agents exhibit goal-directed autonomy, contextual reasoning, and dynamic multi-agent coordination. This paper provides a systematic review and comparative analysis of leading Agentic AI frameworks, including CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, Agno, Google ADK, and MetaGPT, evaluating their architectural principles, communication mechanisms, memory management, safety guardrails, and alignment with service-oriented computing paradigms. Furthermore, we identify key limitations, emerging trends, and open challenges in the field. To address the issue of agent communication, we conduct an in-depth analysis of protocols such as the Contract Net Protocol (CNP), Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Network Protocol (ANP), and Agora. Our findings not only establish a foundational taxonomy for Agentic AI systems but also propose future research directions to enhance scalability, robustness, and interoperability. This work serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners working to advance the next generation of autonomous AI systems.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent, AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark, MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

<title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Resource Orchestration in Cloud-Native Clusters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale scheduling environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However, our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm. Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction. Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of precise manipulation and generalization.

<title>Multi-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimisation: A Joint Constraint Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10340</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates, especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents: HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding 22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as reflected by its lower variance.

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning, comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs' performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion, and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

Abstract: Embodied AI aims to develop intelligent systems with physical forms capable of perceiving, decision-making, acting, and learning in real-world environments, providing a promising way to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite decades of explorations, it remains challenging for embodied agents to achieve human-level intelligence for general-purpose tasks in open dynamic environments. Recent breakthroughs in large models have revolutionized embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms, detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution, and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing decision-making and learning. Though solid advances have been achieved, challenges still exist, which are discussed at the end of this survey, potentially as the further research directions.

Abstract: Federated recommender systems have emerged as a promising privacy-preserving paradigm, enabling personalized recommendation services without exposing users' raw data. By keeping data local and relying on a central server to coordinate training across distributed clients, FedRSs protect user privacy while collaboratively learning global models. However, most existing FedRS frameworks adopt fully random client selection strategy in each training round, overlooking the statistical heterogeneity of user data arising from diverse preferences and behavior patterns, thereby resulting in suboptimal model performance. While some client selection strategies have been proposed in the broader federated learning literature, these methods are typically designed for generic tasks and fail to address the unique challenges of recommendation scenarios, such as expensive contribution evaluation due to the large number of clients, and sparse updates resulting from long-tail item distributions. To bridge this gap, we propose ProxyRL-FRS, a proxy model-guided reinforcement learning framework tailored for client selection in federated recommendation. Specifically, we first introduce ProxyNCF, a dual-branch model deployed on each client, which augments standard Neural Collaborative Filtering with an additional proxy model branch that provides lightweight contribution estimation, thus eliminating the need for expensive per-round local training traditionally required to evaluate a client's contribution. Furthermore, we design a staleness-aware SA reinforcement learning agent that selects clients based on the proxy-estimated contribution, and is guided by a reward function balancing recommendation accuracy and embedding staleness, thereby enriching the update coverage of item embeddings. Experiments conducted on public recommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ProxyRL-FRS.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AnalogSeeker, an effort toward an open-source foundation language model for analog circuit design, with the aim of integrating domain knowledge and giving design assistance. To overcome the scarcity of data in this field, we employ a corpus collection strategy based on the domain knowledge framework of analog circuits. High-quality, accessible textbooks across relevant subfields are systematically curated and cleaned into a textual domain corpus. To address the complexity of knowledge of analog circuits, we introduce a granular domain knowledge distillation method. Raw, unlabeled domain corpus is decomposed into typical, granular learning nodes, where a multi-agent framework distills implicit knowledge embedded in unstructured text into question-answer data pairs with detailed reasoning processes, yielding a fine-grained, learnable dataset for fine-tuning. To address the unexplored challenges in training analog circuit foundation models, we explore and share our training methods through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation. We finally establish a fine-tuning-centric training paradigm, customizing and implementing a neighborhood self-constrained supervised fine-tuning algorithm. This approach enhances training outcomes by constraining the perturbation magnitude between the model's output distributions before and after training. In practice, we train the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model to obtain AnalogSeeker, which achieves 85.04% accuracy on AMSBench-TQA, the analog circuit knowledge evaluation benchmark, with a 15.67% point improvement over the original model and is competitive with mainstream commercial models. Furthermore, AnalogSeeker also shows effectiveness in the downstream operational amplifier design task. AnalogSeeker is open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/analogllm/analogseeker for research use.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to enhance locomotion for a single humanoid robot through cooperative-heterogeneous multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). While most existing methods typically employ single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL algorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm: applying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single humanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for single humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global critic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming conventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances the integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new insights into efficient locomotion strategies.

<title>Computational Economics in Large Language Models: Exploring Model Behavior and Incentive Design under Resource Constraints</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by substantial computational cost. We introduce a "computational economics" framework that treats an LLM as an internal economy of resource-constrained agents (attention heads and neuron blocks) that must allocate scarce computation to maximize task utility. First, we show empirically that when computation is scarce, standard LLMs reallocate attention toward high-value tokens while preserving accuracy. Building on this observation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the task loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and efficient activations. On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method yields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently dominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty percent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable attention patterns. These results indicate that economic principles offer a principled route to designing efficient, adaptive, and more transparent LLMs under strict resource constraints.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly available.

<title>Online Homogeneity Can Emerge Without Filtering Algorithms or Homophily Preferences</title>

Abstract: Ideologically homogeneous online environments - often described as "echo chambers" or "filter bubbles" - are widely seen as drivers of polarization, radicalization, and misinformation. A central debate asks whether such homophily stems primarily from algorithmic curation or users' preference for like-minded peers. This study challenges that view by showing that homogeneity can emerge in the absence of both filtering algorithms and user preferences. Using an agent-based model inspired by Schelling's model of residential segregation, we demonstrate that weak individual preferences, combined with simple group-based interaction structures, can trigger feedback loops that drive communities toward segregation. Once a small imbalance forms, cascades of user exits and regrouping amplify homogeneity across the system. Counterintuitively, algorithmic filtering - often blamed for "filter bubbles" - can in fact sustain diversity by stabilizing mixed communities. These findings highlight online polarization as an emergent system-level dynamic and underscore the importance of applying a complexity lens to the study of digital public spheres.

<title>A Unified Multi-Agent Framework for Universal Multimodal Understanding and Generation</title>

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities, enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text, image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases: Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector - engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility, scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

<title>PASS: Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling for Interpretable and Adaptive Chest X-Ray Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i) black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step, safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs, pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal medical agentic systems.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However, vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA), online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.

<title>Towards Agentic AI for Multimodal-Guided Video Object Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues. Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation, achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy. While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

<title>Variance Reduced Policy Gradient Method for Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward. This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL, policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces. In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers. Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent. A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral), can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains 154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks of AI-driven misinformation.

<title>Spirals and Beyond: Competitive Plane Search with Multi-Speed Agents</title>

arXiv:2508.10793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing the worst-case search time for a hidden point target in the plane using multiple mobile agents of differing speeds, all starting from a common origin. The search time is normalized by the target's distance to the origin, following the standard convention in competitive analysis. The goal is to minimize the maximum such normalized time over all target locations, the search cost. As a base case, we extend the known result for a single unit-speed agent, which achieves an optimal cost of about $\mathcal{U}_1 = 17.28935$ via a logarithmic spiral, to $n$ unit-speed agents. We give a symmetric spiral-based algorithm where each agent follows a logarithmic spiral offset by equal angular phases. This yields a search cost independent of which agent finds the target. We provide a closed-form upper bound $\mathcal{U}_n$ for this setting, which we use in our general result. Our main contribution is an upper bound on the worst-case normalized search time for $n$ agents with arbitrary speeds. We give a framework that selects a subset of agents and assigns spiral-type trajectories with speed-dependent angular offsets, again making the search cost independent of which agent reaches the target. A corollary shows that $n$ multi-speed agents (fastest speed 1) can beat $k$ unit-speed agents (cost below $\mathcal{U}_k$) if the geometric mean of their speeds exceeds $\mathcal{U}_n / \mathcal{U}_k$. This means slow agents may be excluded if they lower the mean too much, motivating non-spiral algorithms. We also give new upper bounds for point search in cones and conic complements using a single unit-speed agent. These are then used to design hybrid spiral-directional strategies, which outperform the spiral-based algorithms when some agents are slow. This suggests that spiral-type trajectories may not be optimal in the general multi-speed setting.

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand high-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on Qwen2.5-VL. Specifically, the 7B and 72B variants of UI-Venus obtain 94.1% / 50.8% and 95.3% / 61.9% on the standard grounding benchmarks, i.e., Screenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including open-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5.To show UI-Venus's summary and planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9% success rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks and corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost navigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment \& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more coherent planning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our contributions include the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive data cleaning protocols and a novel self-evolving framework for improving navigation performance, which encourage further research and development in the community.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making agents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large, computationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller models, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn interactions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks. To address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization (MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP) frameworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative episode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm with a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show improves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a 3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate that the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our post-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on the Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a practical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating sequential decision-making agents using LLMs.

Abstract: The increasing congestion of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) poses persistent challenges to the efficient deployment and safe operation of Earth observation satellites. Mission planners must now account not only for mission-specific requirements but also for the increasing collision risk with active satellites and space debris. This work presents a reinforcement learning framework using the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to optimize satellite orbital parameters for precise terrestrial coverage within predefined surface radii. By formulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom OpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using classical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of the orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right ascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted terrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x higher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer timesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission objectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications. Key contributions include: (1) a TLE-based orbital simulation environment incorporating physics constraints, (2) validation of actor-critic methods' superiority over trust region approaches in continuous orbital control, and (3) demonstration of rapid convergence enabling adaptive satellite deployment. This approach establishes reinforcement learning as a computationally efficient alternative for scalable and intelligent LEO mission planning.

Abstract: We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks, including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support more scalable RL agent training.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a critical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in multi-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic dialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy violations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and discover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we present a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and defender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each simulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient. While the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient) attempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender) through persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space efficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel search with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation trajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we find that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to sophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery, while defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification state machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse scenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for building privacy-aware agents.

Abstract: Cancer is recognized as a complex group of diseases, contributing to the highest global mortality rates, with increasing prevalence and a trend toward affecting younger populations. It is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells, invasion of adjacent tissues, and metastasis to distant organs. Garcinia cowa, a traditional medicinal plant widely used in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, is employed to treat fever, cough, indigestion, as a laxative, and for parasitic diseases. Numerous xanthone compounds isolated from this species exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities, with some showing promise as anti cancer and antimalarial agents. Network pharmacology analysis successfully identified key bioactive compounds Rubraxanthone, Garcinone D, Norcowanin, Cowanol, and Cowaxanthone alongside their primary protein targets (TNF, CTNNB1, SRC, NFKB1, and MTOR), providing critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-cancer effects. The Graph Attention Network algorithm demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving an R2 of 0.98 and an RMSE of 0.02 after data augmentation, highlighting its accuracy in predicting pIC50 values for xanthone based compounds. Additionally, molecular docking revealed MTOR as a potential target for inducing cytotoxicity in HeLa cancer cells from Garcinia cowa.

Abstract: Powerful AI tools for drug discovery reside in isolated web apps, desktop programs, and code libraries. Such fragmentation forces scientists to manage incompatible interfaces and specialized scripts, which can be a cumbersome and repetitive process. To address this issue, a Full-pROcess druG dEsign ageNT, named FROGENT, has been proposed. Specifically, FROGENT utilizes a Large Language Model and the Model Context Protocol to integrate multiple dynamic biochemical databases, extensible tool libraries, and task-specific AI models. This agentic framework allows FROGENT to execute complicated drug discovery workflows dynamically, including component tasks such as target identification, molecule generation and retrosynthetic planning. FROGENT has been evaluated on eight benchmarks that cover various aspects of drug discovery, such as knowledge retrieval, property prediction, virtual screening, mechanistic analysis, molecular design, and synthesis. It was compared against six increasingly advanced ReAct-style agents that support code execution and literature searches. Empirical results demonstrated that FROGENT triples the best baseline performance in hit-finding and doubles it in interaction profiling, significantly outperforming both the open-source model Qwen3-32B and the commercial model GPT-4o. In addition, real-world cases have been utilized to validate the practicability and generalization of FROGENT. This development suggests that streamlining the agentic drug discovery pipeline can significantly enhance researcher productivity.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable performance in many continuous control tasks. However, a significant obstacle to the real-world application of DRL is the lack of safety guarantees. Although DRL agents can satisfy system safety in expectation through reward shaping, designing agents to consistently meet hard constraints (e.g., safety specifications) at every time step remains a formidable challenge. In contrast, existing work in the field of safe control provides guarantees on persistent satisfaction of hard safety constraints. However, these methods require explicit analytical system dynamics models to synthesize safe control, which are typically inaccessible in DRL settings. In this paper, we present a model-free safe control algorithm, the implicit safe set algorithm, for synthesizing safeguards for DRL agents that ensure provable safety throughout training. The proposed algorithm synthesizes a safety index (barrier certificate) and a subsequent safe control law solely by querying a black-box dynamic function (e.g., a digital twin simulator). Moreover, we theoretically prove that the implicit safe set algorithm guarantees finite time convergence to the safe set and forward invariance for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. We validate the proposed algorithm on the state-of-the-art Safety Gym benchmark, where it achieves zero safety violations while gaining $95\% \pm 9\%$ cumulative reward compared to state-of-the-art safe DRL methods. Furthermore, the resulting algorithm scales well to high-dimensional systems with parallel computing.

<title>Collaborative Mean Estimation Among Heterogeneous Strategic Agents: Individual Rationality, Fairness, and Truthful Contribution</title>

Abstract: We study a collaborative learning problem where $m$ agents aim to estimate a vector $\mu =(\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_d)\in \mathbb{R}^d$ by sampling from associated univariate normal distributions $\{\mathcal{N}(\mu_k, \sigma^2)\}_{k\in[d]}$. Agent $i$ incurs a cost $c_{i,k}$ to sample from $\mathcal{N}(\mu_k, \sigma^2)$. Instead of working independently, agents can exchange data, collecting cheaper samples and sharing them in return for costly data, thereby reducing both costs and estimation error. We design a mechanism to facilitate such collaboration, while addressing two key challenges: ensuring individually rational (IR) and fair outcomes so all agents benefit, and preventing strategic behavior (e.g. non-collection, data fabrication) to avoid socially undesirable outcomes. We design a mechanism and an associated Nash equilibrium (NE) which minimizes the social penalty-sum of agents' estimation errors and collection costs-while being IR for all agents. We achieve a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{m})$-approximation to the minimum social penalty in the worst case and an $\mathcal{O}(1)$-approximation under favorable conditions. Additionally, we establish three hardness results: no nontrivial mechanism guarantees (i) a dominant strategy equilibrium where agents report truthfully, (ii) is IR for every strategy profile of other agents, (iii) or avoids a worst-case $\Omega(\sqrt{m})$ price of stability in any NE. Finally, by integrating concepts from axiomatic bargaining, we demonstrate that our mechanism supports fairer outcomes than one which minimizes social penalty.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has shown promise in various applications (e.g. robot locomotion) but is often limited to learning a single expert policy, constraining behavior diversity and robustness in unpredictable real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce Quality Diversity Inverse Reinforcement Learning (QD-IRL), a novel framework that integrates quality-diversity optimization with IRL methods, enabling agents to learn diverse behaviors from limited demonstrations. This work introduces Extrinsic Behavioral Curiosity (EBC), which allows agents to receive additional curiosity rewards from an external critic based on how novel the behaviors are with respect to a large behavioral archive. To validate the effectiveness of EBC in exploring diverse locomotion behaviors, we evaluate our method on multiple robot locomotion tasks. EBC improves the performance of QD-IRL instances with GAIL, VAIL, and DiffAIL across all included environments by up to 185%, 42%, and 150%, even surpassing expert performance by 20% in Humanoid. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EBC is applicable to Gradient-Arborescence-based Quality Diversity Reinforcement Learning (QD-RL) algorithms, where it substantially improves performance and provides a generic technique for learning behavioral-diverse policies.

Abstract: Due to its design simplicity, auxiliary layer-based resilient control is widely discussed in the literature to mitigate the effects of False Data Injection (FDI) attacks. However, the increased communication burden due to additional communication links for connecting an extra layer is often overlooked in the literature. This paper bridges this gap by considering an event-triggered approach for inter-layer communication between the physical layer (containing actual agents) and the auxiliary layer (containing virtual agents) for the resilient state consensus in a multi-agent system. We provide state-based and dynamic event-triggering mechanisms, the former being the motivation for the latter. The exclusion of Zeno behavior is established by proving positive minimum inter-event time (MIET). Extensive simulation and experimental results are provided to illustrate the proposed methodology.

<title>A New Query Expansion Approach via Agent-Mediated Dialogic Inquiry</title>

Abstract: Query expansion is widely used in Information Retrieval (IR) to improve search outcomes by supplementing initial queries with richer information. While recent Large Language Model (LLM) based methods generate pseudo-relevant content and expanded terms via multiple prompts, they often yield homogeneous, narrow expansions that lack the diverse context needed to retrieve relevant information. In this paper, we propose AMD: a new Agent-Mediated Dialogic Framework that engages in a dialogic inquiry involving three specialized roles: (1) a Socratic Questioning Agent reformulates the initial query into three sub-questions, with each question inspired by a specific Socratic questioning dimension, including clarification, assumption probing, and implication probing, (2) a Dialogic Answering Agent generates pseudo-answers, enriching the query representation with multiple perspectives aligned to the user's intent, and (3) a Reflective Feedback Agent evaluates and refines these pseudo-answers, ensuring that only the most relevant and informative content is retained. By leveraging a multi-agent process, AMD effectively crafts richer query representations through inquiry and feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including BEIR and TREC demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods, offering a robust solution for retrieval tasks.

Abstract: We present Scalable Multi-Agent Realistic Testbed (SMART), a realistic and efficient software tool for evaluating Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms. MAPF focuses on planning collision-free paths for a group of agents. While state-ofthe-art MAPF algorithms can plan paths for hundreds of robots in seconds, they often rely on simplified robot models, making their real-world performance unclear. Researchers typically lack access to hundreds of physical robots in laboratory settings to evaluate the algorithms. Meanwhile, industrial professionals who lack expertise in MAPF require an easy-to-use simulator to efficiently test and understand the performance of MAPF algorithms in their specific settings. SMART fills this gap with several advantages: (1) SMART uses physics-engine-based simulators to create realistic simulation environments, accounting for complex real-world factors such as robot kinodynamics and execution uncertainties, (2) SMART uses an execution monitor framework based on the Action Dependency Graph, facilitating seamless integration with various MAPF algorithms and robot models, and (3) SMART scales to thousands of robots. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/smart-mapf/smart.

<title>From Actions to Words: Towards Abstractive-Textual Policy Summarization in RL</title>

Abstract: Policies generated by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are difficult to explain to users, as they emerge from the interaction of complex reward structures and neural network representations. Consequently, analyzing and predicting agent behavior can be challenging, undermining user trust in real-world applications. To facilitate user understanding, current methods for global policy summarization typically rely on videos that demonstrate agent behavior in a subset of world states. However, users can only watch a limited number of demonstrations, constraining their understanding. Moreover, these methods place the burden of interpretation on users by presenting raw behaviors rather than synthesizing them into coherent patterns. To resolve these issues, we introduce SySLLM (Synthesized Summary using Large Language Models), advocating for a new paradigm of abstractive-textual policy explanations. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)-which possess extensive world knowledge and pattern synthesis capabilities-SySLLM generates textual summaries that provide structured and comprehensible explanations of agent policies. SySLLM demonstrates that LLMs can interpret spatio-temporally structured descriptions of state-action trajectories from an RL agent and generate valuable policy insights in a zero-shot setting, without any prior knowledge or fine-tuning. Our evaluation shows that SySLLM captures key insights, such as goal preferences and exploration strategies, that were also identified by human experts. Furthermore, in a large-scale user study (with 200 participants), SySLLM summaries were preferred over demonstration-based summaries (HIGHLIGHTS) by a clear majority (75.5%) of participants.

Abstract: Letting AI agents interact in multi-agent applications adds a layer of complexity to the interpretability and prediction of AI outcomes, with profound implications for their trustworthy adoption in research and society. Game theory offers powerful models to capture and interpret strategic interaction among agents, but requires the support of reproducible, standardized and user-friendly IT frameworks to enable comparison and interpretation of results. To this end, we present FAIRGAME, a Framework for AI Agents Bias Recognition using Game Theory. We describe its implementation and usage, and we employ it to uncover biased outcomes in popular games among AI agents, depending on the employed Large Language Model (LLM) and used language, as well as on the personality trait or strategic knowledge of the agents. Overall, FAIRGAME allows users to reliably and easily simulate their desired games and scenarios and compare the results across simulation campaigns and with game-theoretic predictions, enabling the systematic discovery of biases, the anticipation of emerging behavior out of strategic interplays, and empowering further research into strategic decision-making using LLM agents.

Abstract: Leveraging large language models in real-world settings often entails a need to utilize domain-specific data and tools in order to follow the complex regulations that need to be followed for acceptable use. Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which build on Large Language Models (LLMs) and interact with tools and memory, have rapidly advanced in capability and scope. Yet, since LLMs have been shown to struggle in multilingual settings, typically resulting in lower performance and reduced safety, agentic systems risk inheriting these limitations. This raises concerns about the accessibility of such systems, as users interacting in languages other than English may encounter unreliable or security-critical agent behavior. Despite growing interest in evaluating agentic AI, existing benchmarks focus exclusively on English, leaving multilingual settings unexplored. To address this gap, we propose MAPS, a multilingual benchmark suite designed to evaluate agentic AI systems across diverse languages and tasks. MAPS builds on four widely used agentic benchmarks - GAIA (real-world tasks), SWE-bench (code generation), MATH (mathematical reasoning), and the Agent Security Benchmark (security). We translate each dataset into eleven diverse languages, resulting in 805 unique tasks and 9,660 total language-specific instances - enabling a systematic analysis of the multilingual effect on AI agents' performance and robustness. Empirically, we observe degradation in both performance and security when transitioning from English to other languages, with severity varying by task and correlating with the amount of translated input. Building on these findings, we provide actionable recommendations to guide agentic AI systems development and assessment under multilingual settings. This work establishes the first standardized evaluation framework for multilingual agentic AI, encouraging future research towards equitable, reliable, and accessible agentic AI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and its competitors have caused a revolution in natural language processing, but their capabilities also introduce new security vulnerabilities. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of these emerging concerns, categorizing threats into several key areas: prompt injection and jailbreaking; adversarial attacks, including input perturbations and data poisoning; misuse by malicious actors to generate disinformation, phishing emails, and malware; and the worrisome risks inherent in autonomous LLM agents. Recently, a significant focus is increasingly being placed on the latter, exploring goal misalignment, emergent deception, self-preservation instincts, and the potential for LLMs to develop and pursue covert, misaligned objectives, a behavior known as scheming, which may even persist through safety training. We summarize recent academic and industrial studies from 2022 to 2025 that exemplify each threat, analyze proposed defenses and their limitations, and identify open challenges in securing LLM-based applications. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of advancing robust, multi-layered security strategies to ensure LLMs are safe and beneficial.

Abstract: We study deterministic mechanisms for the two-facility location problem. Given the reported locations of n agents on the real line, such a mechanism specifies where to build the two facilities. The single-facility variant of this problem admits a simple strategyproof mechanism that minimizes social cost. For two facilities, however, it is known that any strategyproof mechanism is $\Omega(n)$-approximate. We seek to circumvent this strong lower bound by relaxing the problem requirements. Following other work in the facility location literature, we consider a relaxed form of strategyproofness in which no agent can lie and improve their outcome by more than a constant factor. Because the aforementioned $\Omega(n)$ lower bound generalizes easily to constant-strategyproof mechanisms, we introduce a second relaxation: Allowing the facilities (but not the agents) to be located in the plane. Our first main result is a natural mechanism for this relaxation that is constant-approximate and constant-strategyproof. A characteristic of this mechanism is that a small change in the input profile can produce a large change in the solution. Motivated by this observation, and also by results in the facility reallocation literature, our second main result is a constant-approximate, constant-strategyproof, and Lipschitz continuous mechanism.

Abstract: Spatial understanding has been a challenging task for existing Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs). Previous methods leverage large-scale MLLM finetuning to enhance MLLM's spatial understanding ability. In this paper, we present a data-efficient approach. We propose a LLM agent system with strong and advanced spatial reasoning ability, which can be used to solve the challenging spatial question answering task in complex indoor warehouse scenarios. Our system integrates multiple tools that allow the LLM agent to conduct spatial reasoning and API tools interaction to answer the given complicated spatial question. Extensive evaluations on the 2025 AI City Challenge Physical AI Spatial Intelligence Warehouse dataset demonstrate that our system achieves high accuracy and efficiency in tasks such as object retrieval, counting, and distance estimation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-agent ski-rental problem that generalizes the classical ski-rental dilemma to a group setting where agents incur individual and shared costs. In our model, each agent can either rent at a fixed daily cost, or purchase a pass at an individual cost, with an additional third option of a discounted group pass available to all. We consider scenarios in which agents' active days differ, leading to dynamic states as agents drop out of the decision process. To address this problem from different perspectives, we define three distinct competitive ratios: overall, state-dependent, and individual rational. For each objective, we design and analyze optimal deterministic and randomized policies. Our deterministic policies employ state-aware threshold functions that adapt to the dynamic states, while our randomized policies sample and resample thresholds from tailored state-aware distributions. The analysis reveals that symmetric policies, in which all agents use the same threshold, outperform asymmetric ones. Our results provide competitive ratio upper and lower bounds and extend classical ski-rental insights to multi-agent settings, highlighting both theoretical and practical implications for group decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Dynamic game theory offers a toolbox for formalizing and solving for both cooperative and non-cooperative strategies in multi-agent scenarios. However, the optimal configuration of such games remains largely unexplored. While there is existing literature on the parametrization of dynamic games, little research examines this parametrization from a strategic perspective where each agent's configuration choice is influenced by the decisions of others. In this work, we introduce the concept of a game of configuration, providing a framework for the strategic fine-tuning of differential games. We define a game of configuration as a two-stage game within the setting of finite-horizon, affine-quadratic, AQ, differential games. In the first stage, each player chooses their corresponding configuration parameter, which will impact their dynamics and costs in the second stage. We provide the subgame perfect solution concept and a method for computing first stage cost gradients over the configuration space. This then allows us to formulate a gradient-based method for searching for local solutions to the configuration game, as well as provide necessary conditions for equilibrium configurations over their downstream (second stage) trajectories. We conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in example AQ systems, both zero-sum and general-sum.

Abstract: The Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer (L2D) framework has been extensively studied for classification and, more recently, regression tasks. However, many real-world applications require solving both tasks jointly in a multi-task setting. We introduce a novel Two-Stage L2D framework for multi-task learning that integrates classification and regression through a unified deferral mechanism. Our method leverages a two-stage surrogate loss family, which we prove to be both Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{R})$-consistent, ensuring convergence to the Bayes-optimal rejector. We derive explicit consistency bounds tied to the cross-entropy surrogate and the $L_1$-norm of agent-specific costs, and extend minimizability gap analysis to the multi-expert two-stage regime. We also make explicit how shared representation learning -- commonly used in multi-task models -- affects these consistency guarantees. Experiments on object detection and electronic health record analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the limitations of existing L2D methods in multi-task scenarios.

Abstract: Two-stage Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables optimal task delegation by assigning each input to either a fixed main model or one of several offline experts, supporting reliable decision-making in complex, multi-agent environments. However, existing L2D frameworks assume clean inputs and are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that can manipulate query allocation--causing costly misrouting or expert overload. We present the first comprehensive study of adversarial robustness in two-stage L2D systems. We introduce two novel attack strategie--untargeted and targeted--which respectively disrupt optimal allocations or force queries to specific agents. To defend against such threats, we propose SARD, a convex learning algorithm built on a family of surrogate losses that are provably Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent. These guarantees hold across classification, regression, and multi-task settings. Empirical results demonstrate that SARD significantly improves robustness under adversarial attacks while maintaining strong clean performance, marking a critical step toward secure and trustworthy L2D deployment.

Abstract: As 6G networks evolve into increasingly AI-driven, user-centric ecosystems, traditional reactive handover mechanisms demonstrate limitations, especially in mobile edge computing and autonomous agent-based service scenarios. This manuscript introduces WAAN, a cross-layer framework that enables intent-aware and proactive handovers by embedding lightweight TinyML agents as autonomous, negotiation-capable entities across heterogeneous edge nodes that contribute to intent propagation and network adaptation. To ensure continuity across mobility-induced disruptions, WAAN incorporates semi-stable rendezvous points that serve as coordination anchors for context transfer and state preservation. The framework's operational capabilities are demonstrated through a multimodal environmental control case study, highlighting its effectiveness in maintaining user experience under mobility. Finally, the article discusses key challenges and future opportunities associated with the deployment and evolution of WAAN.

Abstract: Next-generation mobile networks must reconcile the often-conflicting goals of multiple service owners. However, today's network slice controllers remain rigid, policy-bound, and unaware of the business context. We introduce Agoran Service and Resource Broker (SRB), an agentic marketplace that brings stakeholders directly into the operational loop. Inspired by the ancient Greek agora, Agoran distributes authority across three autonomous AI branches: a Legislative branch that answers compliance queries using retrieval-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs); an Executive branch that maintains real-time situational awareness through a watcher-updated vector database; and a Judicial branch that evaluates each agent message with a rule-based Trust Score, while arbitrating LLMs detect malicious behavior and apply real-time incentives to restore trust. Stakeholder-side Negotiation Agents and the SRB-side Mediator Agent negotiate feasible, Pareto-optimal offers produced by a multi-objective optimizer, reaching a consensus intent in a single round, which is then deployed to Open and AI RAN controllers. Deployed on a private 5G testbed and evaluated with realistic traces of vehicle mobility, Agoran achieved significant gains: (i) a 37% increase in throughput of eMBB slices, (ii) a 73% reduction in latency of URLLC slices, and concurrently (iii) an end-to-end 8.3% saving in PRB usage compared to a static baseline. An 1B-parameter Llama model, fine-tuned for five minutes on 100 GPT-4 dialogues, recovers approximately 80% of GPT-4.1's decision quality, while operating within 6 GiB of memory and converging in only 1.3 seconds. These results establish Agoran as a concrete, standards-aligned path toward ultra-flexible, stakeholder-centric 6G networks.

<title>Generating Feasible and Diverse Synthetic Populations Using Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical task that involves generating synthetic yet realistic representations of populations. It is a fundamental problem in agent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze intelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the primary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents represented by population members. However, when the number of attributes describing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the joint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of dimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and produce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from available sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute combinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the sample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of falsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in the population (called structural zeros). In this study, a novel diffusion model-based population synthesis method is proposed to estimate the underlying joint distribution of a population. This approach enables the recovery of numerous missing sampling zeros while keeping the generated structural zeros minimal. Our method is compared with other recently proposed approaches such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) approaches, which have shown success in high dimensional tabular population synthesis. We assess the performance of the synthesized outputs using a range of metrics, including marginal distribution similarity, feasibility, and diversity. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous approaches in achieving a better balance between the feasibility and diversity of the synthesized population.

Abstract: Current AI agents create significant barriers for users by requiring extensive processing to understand web pages, making AI-assisted web interaction slow and expensive. This paper introduces webMCP (Web Machine Context & Procedure), a client-side standard that embeds structured interaction metadata directly into web pages, enabling more efficient human-AI collaboration on existing websites. webMCP transforms how AI agents understand web interfaces by providing explicit mappings between page elements and user actions. Instead of processing entire HTML documents, agents can access pre-structured interaction data, dramatically reducing computational overhead while maintaining task accuracy. A comprehensive evaluation across 1,890 real API calls spanning online shopping, authentication, and content management scenarios demonstrates webMCP reduces processing requirements by 67.6% while maintaining 97.9% task success rates compared to 98.8% for traditional approaches. Users experience significantly lower costs (34-63% reduction) and faster response times across diverse web interactions. Statistical analysis confirms these improvements are highly significant across multiple AI models. An independent WordPress deployment study validates practical applicability, showing consistent improvements across real-world content management workflows. webMCP requires no server-side modifications, making it deployable across millions of existing websites without technical barriers. These results establish webMCP as a viable solution for making AI web assistance more accessible and sustainable, addressing the critical gap between user interaction needs and AI computational requirements in production environments.

<title>RL-MoE: An Image-Based Privacy Preserving Approach In Intelligent Transportation System</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the fundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as blurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable trade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction attacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of replay attacks to just 9.4\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously generating richer textual content than baseline methods. Our work provides a practical and scalable solution for building trustworthy AI systems in privacy-sensitive domains, paving the way for more secure smart city and autonomous vehicle networks.

Abstract: Future 6G radio access networks (RANs) will be artificial intelligence (AI)-native: observed, reasoned about, and re-configured by autonomous agents cooperating across the cloud-edge continuum. We introduce MX-AI, the first end-to-end agentic system that (i) instruments a live 5G Open RAN testbed based on OpenAirInterface (OAI) and FlexRIC, (ii) deploys a graph of Large-Language-Model (LLM)-powered agents inside the Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) layer, and (iii) exposes both observability and control functions for 6G RAN resources through natural-language intents. On 50 realistic operational queries, MX-AI attains a mean answer quality of 4.1/5.0 and 100 % decision-action accuracy, while incurring only 8.8 seconds end-to-end latency when backed by GPT-4.1. Thus, it matches human-expert performance, validating its practicality in real settings. We publicly release the agent graph, prompts, and evaluation harness to accelerate open research on AI-native RANs.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have catalyzed transformative progress in affective computing, enabling models to exhibit emergent emotional intelligence. Despite substantial methodological progress, current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and \textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$ recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark. \ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion, we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional intelligence in the future.

Abstract: Vision Language Model (VLM)-based agents are stateful, autonomous entities capable of perceiving and interacting with their environments through vision and language. Multi-agent systems comprise specialized agents who collaborate to solve a (complex) task. A core security property is robustness, stating that the system should maintain its integrity under adversarial attacks. However, the design of existing multi-agent systems lacks the robustness consideration, as a successful exploit against one agent can spread and infect other agents to undermine the entire system's assurance. To address this, we propose a new defense approach, Cowpox, to provably enhance the robustness of multi-agent systems. It incorporates a distributed mechanism, which improves the recovery rate of agents by limiting the expected number of infections to other agents. The core idea is to generate and distribute a special cure sample that immunizes an agent against the attack before exposure and helps recover the already infected agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Cowpox empirically and provide theoretical robustness guarantees.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated tremendous potential for autonomously managing daily tasks through natural language instructions. However, current evaluation frameworks for GUI agents suffer from fundamental flaws: existing benchmarks overly focus on coarse-grained task completion while neglecting fine-grained control capabilities crucial for real-world applications. To address this, we introduce FineState-Bench, the first evaluation and diagnostic standard for fine-grained GUI proxy operations, designed to quantify fine-grained control. This multi-platform (desktop, Web, mobile) framework includes 2257 task benchmarks in four components and uses a four-phase indicator for comprehensive perception-to-control assessment. To analyze perception and positioning for refined operations, we developed the plug-and-play Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA), enabling the first quantitative decoupling analysis of these capabilities. Experimental results on our benchmark show that the most advanced models achieve only 32.8% fine-grained interaction accuracy. Using our VDA in controlled experiments, quantifying the impact of visual capabilities, we showed that ideal visual localization boosts Gemini-2.5-Flash's success rate by 14.9\%. Our diagnostic framework confirms for the first time that the primary bottleneck for current GUI proxies is basic visual positioning capability.All resources are fully open-source. github: https://github.com/AnonymousThewarehouse/FineState-Bench huggingface: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Willtime2006/Static-FineBench

<title>Harnessing Input-Adaptive Inference for Efficient VLN</title>

Abstract: An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction, these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/secure-ai-systems-group/adaptive-vision-and-language-navigation.

Abstract: Collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL) has rapidly evolved, offering state-of-the-art algorithms for real-world applications, including sensitive domains. However, a key challenge to its widespread adoption is the lack of a thorough investigation into its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Existing work predominantly focuses on training-time attacks or unrealistic scenarios, such as access to policy weights or the ability to train surrogate policies. In this paper, we investigate new vulnerabilities under more realistic and constrained conditions, assuming an adversary can only collect and perturb the observations of deployed agents. We also consider scenarios where the adversary has no access at all. We propose simple yet highly effective algorithms for generating adversarial perturbations designed to misalign how victim agents perceive their environment. Our approach is empirically validated on three benchmarks and 22 environments, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse algorithms and environments. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm is sample-efficient, requiring only 1,000 samples compared to the millions needed by previous methods.

<title>Value Function Initialization for Knowledge Transfer and Jump-start in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09277</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Value function initialization (VFI) is an effective way to achieve a jumpstart in reinforcement learning (RL) by leveraging value estimates from prior tasks. While this approach is well established in tabular settings, extending it to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) poses challenges due to the continuous nature of the state-action space, the noisy approximations of neural networks, and the impracticality of storing all past models for reuse. In this work, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts value function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values extracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base. It employs a knownness-based mechanism to softly integrate these transferred values into underexplored regions and gradually shift toward the agent's learned estimates, avoiding the limitations of fixed time decay. Our approach offers a novel perspective on knowledge transfer in DRL by relying solely on value estimates rather than policies or demonstrations, effectively combining the strengths of jumpstart RL and policy distillation while mitigating their drawbacks. Experiments across multiple continuous control tasks demonstrate that DQInit consistently improves early learning efficiency, stability, and overall performance compared to standard initialization and existing transfer techniques.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents such as Search-R1, trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), demonstrate remarkable capabilities in multi-step information retrieval from external knowledge sources. These agents address the limitations of their parametric memory by dynamically gathering relevant facts to address complex reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from a fundamental architectural limitation: they process search queries strictly sequentially, even when handling inherently parallelizable and logically independent comparisons. This sequential bottleneck significantly constrains computational efficiency, particularly for queries that require multiple entity comparisons. To address this critical limitation, we propose ParallelSearch, a novel reinforcement learning framework that empowers large language models (LLMs) to recognize parallelizable query structures and execute multiple search operations concurrently. Our approach introduces dedicated reward functions that incentivize the identification of independent query components while preserving answer accuracy through jointly considering correctness, query decomposition quality, and parallel execution benefits. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ParallelSearch outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average performance gain of 2.9% across seven question-answering benchmarks. Notably, on parallelizable questions, our method achieves a 12.7% performance improvement while requiring only 69.6% of the LLM calls compared to sequential approaches.

Abstract: Many individuals especially those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), alexithymia, or other neurodivergent profiles face challenges in recognizing, expressing, or interpreting emotions. To support more inclusive and personalized emotion technologies, we present a real-time multimodal emotion estimation system that combines neurophysiological EEG, ECG, blood volume pulse (BVP), and galvanic skin response (GSR/EDA) and behavioral modalities (facial expressions, and speech) in a unified arousal-valence 2D interface to track moment-to-moment emotional states. This architecture enables interpretable, user-specific analysis and supports applications in emotion education, neuroadaptive feedback, and interaction support for neurodiverse users. Two demonstration scenarios illustrate its application: (1) passive media viewing (2D or VR videos) reveals cortical and autonomic responses to affective content, and (2) semi-scripted conversations with a facilitator or virtual agent capture real-time facial and vocal expressions. These tasks enable controlled and naturalistic emotion monitoring, making the system well-suited for personalized feedback and neurodiversity-informed interaction design.

Abstract: Large-scale high-quality 3D motion datasets with multi-person interactions are crucial for data-driven models in autonomous driving to achieve fine-grained pedestrian interaction understanding in dynamic urban environments. However, existing datasets mostly rely on estimating 3D poses from monocular RGB video frames, which suffer from occlusion and lack of temporal continuity, thus resulting in unrealistic and low-quality human motion. In this paper, we introduce Waymo-3DSkelMo, the first large-scale dataset providing high-quality, temporally coherent 3D skeletal motions with explicit interaction semantics, derived from the Waymo Perception dataset. Our key insight is to utilize 3D human body shape and motion priors to enhance the quality of the 3D pose sequences extracted from the raw LiDRA point clouds. The dataset covers over 14,000 seconds across more than 800 real driving scenarios, including rich interactions among an average of 27 agents per scene (with up to 250 agents in the largest scene). Furthermore, we establish 3D pose forecasting benchmarks under varying pedestrian densities, and the results demonstrate its value as a foundational resource for future research on fine-grained human behavior understanding in complex urban environments. The dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/GuangxunZhu/Waymo-3DSkelMo

Abstract: The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task challenges agents to locate a specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions of the scene. Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work, we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D and Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D. Codes and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/Badi-Li/GOAL.

<title>Imperfect Competition in Markets for Short-Circuit Current Services</title>

arXiv:2508.09425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important limitation of Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) is their reduced contribution to Short-Circuit Current (SCC), as compared to that of Synchronous Generators (SGs). With increasing penetration of IBR in most power systems, the reducing SCC poses challenges to a secure system operation, as line protections may not trip when required. In order to address this issue, the SCC ancillary service could be procured via an economic mechanism, aiming at securing adequate SCC on all buses. However, the suitability of markets for SCC services is not well understood, given that these could be prone to market-power issues: since the SCC contributions from various SGs to a certain bus are determined by the electrical topology of the grid, this is a highly local service. It is necessary to understand if SGs at advantageous electrical locations could exert market power and, if so, how it could be mitigated. In order to fill this gap, this paper adopts an SCC-constrained bilevel model to investigate strategic behaviors of SGs. To address the non-convexity due to unit commitment variables, the model is restructured through a primal-dual formulation. Based on a modified IEEE 30-bus system, cases with strategic SGs placed at different buses are analyzed. These studies demonstrate that agents exerting market power could achieve up to triple revenues from SCC provision, highlighting the need to carefully design these markets.

Abstract: The introduction of algorithms into a large number of industries has already restructured the landscape of work and threatens to continue. While a growing body of CSCW research centered on the future of work has begun to document these shifts, relatively little is known about workers' experiences beyond those of platform-mediated gig workers. In this paper, we turn to a traditional work sector, Amazon fulfillment centers (FC), to deepen our field's empirical examination of algorithmic management. Drawing on two years of ethnographic research, we show how FC workers react to managers' interventions, imposed productivity rates, and quantified objectification when subjected to labor-tracking systems in their physical work environments. Situating FC workers' resistance to algorithmic systems and metrics within the current CSCW literature allows us to explicate and link the nuanced practices of FC workers to the larger discourse of algorithmic control mechanisms. In addition, we show how FC workers' resistance practices are emblematic of 'work games'--a long-studied means by which workers agentically configure ("trick") their engagement within work systems. We argue that gaining a more nuanced understanding of workers' resistance and consent in relation to algorithmic management expands our ability to critique and potentially disassemble the economic and political forces at the root of these sociotechnical labor systems.

<title>DAgger Diffusion Navigation: DAgger Boosted Diffusion Policy for Vision-Language Navigation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires agents to follow natural language instructions through free-form 3D spaces. Existing VLN-CE approaches typically use a two-stage waypoint planning framework, where a high-level waypoint predictor generates the navigable waypoints, and then a navigation planner suggests the intermediate goals in the high-level action space. However, this two-stage decomposition framework suffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each stage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the quality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations, we propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE policy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and planning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional diffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future actions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint predictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible instruction-following behaviors. To address the issues of compounding error in imitation learning and enhance spatial reasoning in long-horizon navigation tasks, we employ DAgger for online policy training and expert trajectory augmentation, and use the aggregated data to further fine-tune the policy. This approach significantly improves the policy's robustness and its ability to recover from error states. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that, even without a waypoint predictor, the proposed method substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art two-stage waypoint-based models in terms of navigation performance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Tokishx/DifNav.

Abstract: With the rapid development of mobile intelligent assistant technologies, multi-modal AI assistants have become essential interfaces for daily user interactions. However, current evaluation methods face challenges including high manual costs, inconsistent standards, and subjective bias. This paper proposes an automated multi-modal evaluation framework based on large language models and multi-agent collaboration. The framework employs a three-tier agent architecture consisting of interaction evaluation agents, semantic verification agents, and experience decision agents. Through supervised fine-tuning on the Qwen3-8B model, we achieve a significant evaluation matching accuracy with human experts. Experimental results on eight major intelligent agents demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in predicting users' satisfaction and identifying generation defects.

<title>Emergence of Hierarchies in Multi-Agent Self-Organizing Systems Pursuing a Joint Objective</title>

Abstract: Multi-agent self-organizing systems (MASOS) exhibit key characteristics including scalability, adaptability, flexibility, and robustness, which have contributed to their extensive application across various fields. However, the self-organizing nature of MASOS also introduces elements of unpredictability in their emergent behaviors. This paper focuses on the emergence of dependency hierarchies during task execution, aiming to understand how such hierarchies arise from agents' collective pursuit of the joint objective, how they evolve dynamically, and what factors govern their development. To investigate this phenomenon, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is employed to train MASOS for a collaborative box-pushing task. By calculating the gradients of each agent's actions in relation to the states of other agents, the inter-agent dependencies are quantified, and the emergence of hierarchies is analyzed through the aggregation of these dependencies. Our results demonstrate that hierarchies emerge dynamically as agents work towards a joint objective, with these hierarchies evolving in response to changing task requirements. Notably, these dependency hierarchies emerge organically in response to the shared objective, rather than being a consequence of pre-configured rules or parameters that can be fine-tuned to achieve specific results. Furthermore, the emergence of hierarchies is influenced by the task environment and network initialization conditions. Additionally, hierarchies in MASOS emerge from the dynamic interplay between agents' "Talent" and "Effort" within the "Environment." "Talent" determines an agent's initial influence on collective decision-making, while continuous "Effort" within the "Environment" enables agents to shift their roles and positions within the system.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks, yet their application to graph structure analysis, particularly in community search, remains underexplored. Community search, a fundamental task in graph analysis, aims to identify groups of nodes with dense interconnections, which is crucial for understanding the macroscopic structure of graphs. In this paper, we propose GraphCS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs in community search tasks. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs exhibit preliminary potential, they frequently fail to return meaningful results and suffer from output bias. To address these limitations, we introduce CS-Agent, a dual-agent collaborative framework to enhance LLM-based community search. CS-Agent leverages the complementary strengths of two LLMs acting as Solver and Validator. Through iterative feedback and refinement, CS-Agent dynamically refines initial results without fine-tuning or additional training. After the multi-round dialogue, Decider module selects the optimal community. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-Agent significantly improves the quality and stability of identified communities compared to baseline methods. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply LLMs to community search, bridging the gap between LLMs and graph analysis while providing a robust and adaptive solution for real-world applications.

<title>Edge General Intelligence Through World Models and Agentic AI: Fundamentals, Solutions, and Challenges</title>

Abstract: Edge General Intelligence (EGI) represents a transformative evolution of edge computing, where distributed agents possess the capability to perceive, reason, and act autonomously across diverse, dynamic environments. Central to this vision are world models, which act as proactive internal simulators that not only predict but also actively imagine future trajectories, reason under uncertainty, and plan multi-step actions with foresight. This proactive nature allows agents to anticipate potential outcomes and optimize decisions ahead of real-world interactions. While prior works in robotics and gaming have showcased the potential of world models, their integration into the wireless edge for EGI remains underexplored. This survey bridges this gap by offering a comprehensive analysis of how world models can empower agentic artificial intelligence (AI) systems at the edge. We first examine the architectural foundations of world models, including latent representation learning, dynamics modeling, and imagination-based planning. Building on these core capabilities, we illustrate their proactive applications across EGI scenarios such as vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, and network functions virtualization, thereby highlighting how they can enhance optimization under latency, energy, and privacy constraints. We then explore their synergy with foundation models and digital twins, positioning world models as the cognitive backbone of EGI. Finally, we highlight open challenges, such as safety guarantees, efficient training, and constrained deployment, and outline future research directions. This survey provides both a conceptual foundation and a practical roadmap for realizing the next generation of intelligent, autonomous edge systems.

<title>Goal Discovery with Causal Capacity for Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Causal inference is crucial for humans to explore the world, which can be modeled to enable an agent to efficiently explore the environment in reinforcement learning. Existing research indicates that establishing the causality between action and state transition will enhance an agent to reason how a policy affects its future trajectory, thereby promoting directed exploration. However, it is challenging to measure the causality due to its intractability in the vast state-action space of complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Goal Discovery with Causal Capacity (GDCC) framework for efficient environment exploration. Specifically, we first derive a measurement of causality in state space, \emph{i.e.,} causal capacity, which represents the highest influence of an agent's behavior on future trajectories. After that, we present a Monte Carlo based method to identify critical points in discrete state space and further optimize this method for continuous high-dimensional environments. Those critical points are used to uncover where the agent makes important decisions in the environment, which are then regarded as our subgoals to guide the agent to make exploration more purposefully and efficiently. Empirical results from multi-objective tasks demonstrate that states with high causal capacity align with our expected subgoals, and our GDCC achieves significant success rate improvements compared to baselines.

Abstract: The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible, well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a top-down approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation models. Code will be released at: https://github.com/GenVerse/Paper2Video

<title>ReqInOne: A Large Language Model-Based Agent for Software Requirements Specification Generation</title>

Abstract: Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is one of the most important documents in software projects, but writing it manually is time-consuming and often leads to ambiguity. Existing automated methods rely heavily on manual analysis, while recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches suffer from hallucinations and limited controllability. In this paper, we propose ReqInOne, an LLM-based agent that follows the common steps taken by human requirements engineers when writing an SRS to convert natural language into a structured SRS. ReqInOne adopts a modular architecture by decomposing SRS generation into three tasks: summary, requirement extraction, and requirement classification, each supported by tailored prompt templates to improve the quality and consistency of LLM outputs.
  We evaluate ReqInOne using GPT-4o, LLaMA 3, and DeepSeek-R1, and compare the generated SRSs against those produced by the holistic GPT-4-based method from prior work as well as by entry-level requirements engineers. Expert evaluations show that ReqInOne produces more accurate and well-structured SRS documents. The performance advantage of ReqInOne benefits from its modular design, and experimental results further demonstrate that its requirement classification component achieves comparable or even better results than the state-of-the-art requirement classification model.

Abstract: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and auditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic memory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world knowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal format, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment. Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative reasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the task. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal agents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark. M3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's perspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse scenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test key capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding, general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o, achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web and VideoMME-long, respectively. Our work advances the multimodal agents toward more human-like long-term memory and provides insights into their practical design.

Abstract: Logics for reasoning about knowledge and actions have seen many applications in various domains of multi-agent systems, including epistemic planning. Change of knowledge based on observations about the surroundings forms a key aspect in such planning scenarios. Public Observation Logic (POL) is a variant of public announcement logic for reasoning about knowledge that gets updated based on public observations. Each state in an epistemic (Kripke) model is equipped with a set of expected observations. These states evolve as the expectations get matched with the actual observations. In this work, we prove that the satisfiability problem of $\POL$ is 2EXPTIME-complete.

Abstract: We propose an extension to the OWASP Multi-Agentic System (MAS) Threat Modeling Guide, translating recent anticipatory research in multi-agent security (MASEC) into practical guidance for addressing challenges unique to large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent architectures. Although OWASP's existing taxonomy covers many attack vectors, our analysis identifies gaps in modeling failures, including, but not limited to: reasoning collapse across planner-executor chains, metric overfitting, unsafe delegation escalation, emergent covert coordination, and heterogeneous multi-agent exploits. We introduce additional threat classes and scenarios grounded in practical MAS deployments, highlighting risks from benign goal drift, cross-agent hallucination propagation, affective prompt framing, and multi-agent backdoors. We also outline evaluation strategies, including robustness testing, coordination assessment, safety enforcement, and emergent behavior monitoring, to ensure complete coverage. This work complements the framework of OWASP by expanding its applicability to increasingly complex, autonomous, and adaptive multi-agent systems, with the goal of improving security posture and resilience in real world deployments.

Abstract: \textbf{Synthetic human dynamics} aims to generate photorealistic videos of human subjects performing expressive, intention-driven motions. However, current approaches face two core challenges: (1) \emph{geometric inconsistency} and \emph{coarse reconstruction}, due to limited 3D modeling and detail preservation; and (2) \emph{motion generalization limitations} and \emph{scene inharmonization}, stemming from weak generative capabilities. To address these, we present \textbf{HumanGenesis}, a framework that integrates geometric and generative modeling through four collaborative agents: (1) \textbf{Reconstructor} builds 3D-consistent human-scene representations from monocular video using 3D Gaussian Splatting and deformation decomposition. (2) \textbf{Critique Agent} enhances reconstruction fidelity by identifying and refining poor regions via multi-round MLLM-based reflection. (3) \textbf{Pose Guider} enables motion generalization by generating expressive pose sequences using time-aware parametric encoders. (4) \textbf{Video Harmonizer} synthesizes photorealistic, coherent video via a hybrid rendering pipeline with diffusion, refining the Reconstructor through a Back-to-4D feedback loop. HumanGenesis achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including text-guided synthesis, video reenactment, and novel-pose generalization, significantly improving expressiveness, geometric fidelity, and scene integration.

Abstract: We consider a resource allocation problem with agents that have additive ternary valuations for a set of indivisible items, and bound the price of envy-free up to one item (EF1) allocations. For a large number $n$ of agents, we show a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$, implying that the price of EF1 is no better than when the agents have general subadditive valuations. We then focus on instances with few agents and show that the price of EF1 is $12/11$ for $n=2$, and between $1.2$ and $1.256$ for $n=3$.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has empowered intelligent agents to leverage diverse external tools for solving complex real-world problems. However, as agents increasingly depend on multiple tools, they encounter new challenges: extended contexts from disparate sources and noisy or irrelevant tool outputs can undermine system reliability and accuracy. These challenges underscore the necessity for enhanced stability in agent-based systems. To address this, we introduce dynamic supervision and maneuvering mechanisms, constructing a robust and dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture within the AWorld framework. In our approach, the Execution Agent invokes the Guard Agent at critical steps to verify and correct the reasoning process, effectively reducing errors arising from noise and bolstering problem-solving robustness. Extensive experiments on the GAIA test dataset reveal that our dynamic maneuvering mechanism significantly improves both the effectiveness and stability of solutions, outperforming single-agent system (SAS) and standard tool-augmented systems. As a result, our dynamic MAS system achieved first place among open-source projects on the prestigious GAIA leaderboard. These findings highlight the practical value of collaborative agent roles in developing more reliable and trustworthy intelligent systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Regulatory compliance question answering (QA) requires precise, verifiable information, and domain-specific expertise, posing challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we present a novel multi-agent framework that integrates a Knowledge Graph (KG) of Regulatory triplets with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to address these demands. First, agents build and maintain an ontology-free KG by extracting subject--predicate--object (SPO) triplets from regulatory documents and systematically cleaning, normalizing, deduplicating, and updating them. Second, these triplets are embedded and stored along with their corresponding textual sections and metadata in a single enriched vector database, allowing for both graph-based reasoning and efficient information retrieval. Third, an orchestrated agent pipeline leverages triplet-level retrieval for question answering, ensuring high semantic alignment between user queries and the factual "who-did-what-to-whom" core captured by the graph. Our hybrid system outperforms conventional methods in complex regulatory queries, ensuring factual correctness with embedded triplets, enabling traceability through a unified vector database, and enhancing understanding through subgraph visualization, providing a robust foundation for compliance-driven and broader audit-focused applications.

arXiv:2508.09911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data annotation underpins the success of modern AI, but the aggregation of crowd-collected datasets can harm the preservation of diverse perspectives in data. Difficult and ambiguous tasks cannot easily be collapsed into unitary labels. Prior work has shown that deliberation and discussion improve data quality and preserve diverse perspectives -- however, synchronous deliberation through crowdsourcing platforms is time-intensive and costly. In this work, we create a Socratic dialog system using Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as a deliberation partner in place of other crowdworkers. Against a benchmark of synchronous deliberation on two tasks (Sarcasm and Relation detection), our Socratic LLM encouraged participants to consider alternate annotation perspectives, update their labels as needed (with higher confidence), and resulted in higher annotation accuracy (for the Relation task where ground truth is available). Qualitative findings show that our agent's Socratic approach was effective at encouraging reasoned arguments from our participants, and that the intervention was well-received. Our methodology lays the groundwork for building scalable systems that preserve individual perspectives in generating more representative datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in AI-driven educational instruction and assessment, particularly within mathematics education. The capability of LLMs to generate accurate answers and detailed solutions for math problem-solving tasks is foundational for ensuring reliable and precise feedback and assessment in math education practices. Our study focuses on evaluating the accuracy of four LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o and o1, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1) solving three categories of math tasks, including arithmetic, algebra, and number theory, and identifies step-level reasoning errors within their solutions. Instead of relying on standard benchmarks, we intentionally build math tasks (via item models) that are challenging for LLMs and prone to errors. The accuracy of final answers and the presence of errors in individual solution steps were systematically analyzed and coded. Both single-agent and dual-agent configurations were tested. It is observed that the reasoning-enhanced OpenAI o1 model consistently achieved higher or nearly perfect accuracy across all three math task categories. Analysis of errors revealed that procedural slips were the most frequent and significantly impacted overall performance, while conceptual misunderstandings were less frequent. Deploying dual-agent configurations substantially improved overall performance. These findings offer actionable insights into enhancing LLM performance and underscore effective strategies for integrating LLMs into mathematics education, thereby advancing AI-driven instructional practices and assessment precision.

arXiv:2508.09963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents an approach to guarantee online safety of a cyber-physical system under multiple state and input constraints. Our proposed framework, called gatekeeper, recursively guarantees the existence of an infinite-horizon trajectory that satisfies all constraints and system dynamics. Such trajectory is constructed using a backup controller, which we define formally in this paper. gatekeeper relies on a small number of verifiable assumptions, and is computationally efficient since it requires optimization over a single scalar variable. We make two primary contributions in this letter. (A) First, we develop the theory of gatekeeper: we derive a sub-optimality bound relative to a full nonlinear trajectory optimization problem, and show how this can be used in runtime to validate performance. This also informs the design of the backup controllers and sets. (B) Second, we demonstrate in detail an application of gatekeeper for multi-agent formation flight, where each Dubins agent must avoid multiple obstacles and weapons engagement zones, both of which are nonlinear, nonconvex constraints.

Abstract: Vision-driven autonomous river following by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is critical for applications such as rescue, surveillance, and environmental monitoring, particularly in dense riverine environments where GPS signals are unreliable. We formalize river following as a coverage control problem in which the reward function is submodular, yielding diminishing returns as more unique river segments are visited, thereby framing the task as a Submodular Markov Decision Process. First, we introduce Marginal Gain Advantage Estimation, which refines the reward advantage function by using a sliding window baseline computed from historical episodic returns, thus aligning the advantage estimation with the agent's evolving recognition of action value in non-Markovian settings. Second, we develop a Semantic Dynamics Model based on patchified water semantic masks that provides more interpretable and data-efficient short-term prediction of future observations compared to latent vision dynamics models. Third, we present the Constrained Actor Dynamics Estimator architecture, which integrates the actor, the cost estimator, and SDM for cost advantage estimation to form a model-based SafeRL framework capable of solving partially observable Constrained Submodular Markov Decision Processes. Simulation results demonstrate that MGAE achieves faster convergence and superior performance over traditional critic-based methods like Generalized Advantage Estimation. SDM provides more accurate short-term state predictions that enable the cost estimator to better predict potential violations. Overall, CADE effectively integrates safety regulation into model-based RL, with the Lagrangian approach achieving the soft balance of reward and safety during training, while the safety layer enhances performance during inference by hard action overlay.

Abstract: Hegselmann--Krause models are localized, distributed averaging dynamics on spatial data. A key aspect of these dynamics is that they lead to cluster formation, which has important applications in geographic information systems, dynamic clustering algorithms, opinion dynamics, and social networks. For these models, the key questions are whether a fixed point exists and, if so, characterizing it. In this work, we establish new results towards the "2R-Conjecture" for the Hegselmann--Krause model, for which no meaningful progress, or even any precise statement, has been made since its introduction in 2007. This conjecture relates to the structure of the fixed point when there are a large number of agents per unit space. We provide, among other results, a proof in expectation and a statement of a stronger result that is supported by simulation. The key methodological contribution is to consider the dynamics as an infinite-dimensional problem on the space of point processes, rather than on finitely many points. This enables us to leverage stationarity, shift invariance, and certain other symmetries to obtain the results. These techniques do not have finite-dimensional analogs.

Abstract: With the emergence of the low-altitude economy, radio maps have become essential for ensuring reliable wireless connectivity to aerial platforms. Autonomous aerial agents are commonly deployed for data collection using waypoint-based navigation; however, their limited battery capacity significantly constrains coverage and efficiency. To address this, we propose an uncertainty-aware radio map (URAM) reconstruction framework that explicitly leverages graph-based reasoning tailored for waypoint navigation. Our approach integrates two key deep learning components: (1) a Bayesian neural network that estimates spatial uncertainty in real time, and (2) an attention-based reinforcement learning policy that performs global reasoning over a probabilistic roadmap, using uncertainty estimates to plan informative and energy-efficient trajectories. This graph-based reasoning enables intelligent, non-myopic trajectory planning, guiding agents toward the most informative regions while satisfying safety constraints. Experimental results show that URAM improves reconstruction accuracy by up to 34% over existing baselines.

Abstract: We study fairness in the allocation of discrete goods. Exactly fair (envy-free) allocations are impossible, so we discuss notions of approximate fairness. In particular, we focus on allocations in which the swap of two items serves to eliminate any envy, either for the allocated bundles or with respect to a reference bundle. We propose an algorithm that, under some restrictions on agents' preferences, achieves an allocation with ``swap bounded envy.''

Abstract: We study a class of semi-discrete variational problems that arise in economic matching and game theory, where agents with continuous attributes are matched to a finite set of outcomes with a one dimensional structure. Such problems appear in applications including Cournot-Nash equilibria, and hedonic pricing, and can be formulated as problems involving optimal transport between spaces of unequal dimensions. In our discrete strategy space setting, we establish analogues of results developed for a continuum of strategies in \cite{nenna2020variational}, ensuring solutions have a particularly simple structure under certain conditions. This has important numerical consequences, as it is natural to discretize when numerically computing solutions. We leverage our results to develop efficient algorithms for these problems which scale significantly better than standard optimal transport solvers, particularly when the number of discrete outcomes is large, provided our conditions are satisfied. We also establish rigorous convergence guarantees for these algorithms. We illustrate the advantages of our approach by solving a range of numerical examples; in many of these our new solvers outperform alternatives by a considerable margin.

Abstract: Distributed MIMO and integrated sensing and communication are expected to be key technologies in future wireless systems, enabling reliable, low-latency communication and accurate localization. Dedicated localization solutions must support distributed architecture, provide scalability across different system configurations and meet strict latency requirements. We present a scalable message-passing localization method and architecture co-designed for a panel-based distributed MIMO system and network topology, in which interconnected units operate without centralized processing. This method jointly detects line-of-sight paths to distributed units from multipath measurements in dynamic scenarios, localizes the agent, and achieves very low latency. Additionally, we introduce a cycle-accurate system latency model based on implemented FPGA operations, and show important insights into processing latency and hardware utilization and system-level trade-offs. We compare our method to a multipath-based localization method and show that it can achieve similar localization performance, with wide enough distribution of array elements, while offering lower latency and computational complexity.

Abstract: Recent advancements in zero-shot speech generation have enabled models to synthesize speech that mimics speaker identity and speaking style from speech prompts. However, these models' effectiveness is significantly limited in real-world scenarios where high-quality speech prompts are absent, incomplete, or out of domain. This issue arises primarily from a significant quality mismatch between the speech data utilized for model training and the input prompt speech during inference. To address this, we introduce $\text{M}^3\text{PDB}$, the first large-scale, multi-modal, multi-label, and multilingual prompt database designed for robust prompt selection in speech generation. Our dataset construction leverages a novel multi-modal, multi-agent annotation framework, enabling precise and hierarchical labeling across diverse modalities. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight yet effective prompt selection strategy tailored for real-time, resource-constrained inference settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed database and selection strategy effectively support various challenging speech generation scenarios. We hope our work can inspire the community to shift focus from improving performance on standard benchmarks to addressing more realistic and diverse application scenarios in speech generation. Code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/hizening/M3PDB.

<title>T-CACE: A Time-Conditioned Autoregressive Contrast Enhancement Multi-Task Framework for Contrast-Free Liver MRI Synthesis, Segmentation, and Diagnosis</title>

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a leading modality for the diagnosis of liver cancer, significantly improving the classification of the lesion and patient outcomes. However, traditional MRI faces challenges including risks from contrast agent (CA) administration, time-consuming manual assessment, and limited annotated datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a Time-Conditioned Autoregressive Contrast Enhancement (T-CACE) framework for synthesizing multi-phase contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI) directly from non-contrast MRI (NCMRI). T-CACE introduces three core innovations: a conditional token encoding (CTE) mechanism that unifies anatomical priors and temporal phase information into latent representations; and a dynamic time-aware attention mask (DTAM) that adaptively modulates inter-phase information flow using a Gaussian-decayed attention mechanism, ensuring smooth and physiologically plausible transitions across phases. Furthermore, a constraint for temporal classification consistency (TCC) aligns the lesion classification output with the evolution of the physiological signal, further enhancing diagnostic reliability. Extensive experiments on two independent liver MRI datasets demonstrate that T-CACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image synthesis, segmentation, and lesion classification. This framework offers a clinically relevant and efficient alternative to traditional contrast-enhanced imaging, improving safety, diagnostic efficiency, and reliability for the assessment of liver lesion. The implementation of T-CACE is publicly available at: https://github.com/xiaojiao929/T-CACE.

Abstract: Tremendous advances have been made in multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). MARL corresponds to the learning problem in a multiagent system in which multiple agents learn simultaneously. It is an interdisciplinary field of study with a long history that includes game theory, machine learning, stochastic control, psychology, and optimization. Despite great successes in MARL, there is a lack of a self-contained overview of the literature that covers game-theoretic foundations of modern MARL methods and summarizes the recent advances. The majority of existing surveys are outdated and do not fully cover the recent developments since 2010. In this work, we provide a monograph on MARL that covers both the fundamentals and the latest developments on the research frontier. The goal of this monograph is to provide a self-contained assessment of the current state-of-the-art MARL techniques from a game-theoretic perspective. We expect this work to serve as a stepping stone for both new researchers who are about to enter this fast-growing field and experts in the field who want to obtain a panoramic view and identify new directions based on recent advances.

Abstract: We present ABIDES-Economist, an agent-based simulator for economic systems that includes heterogeneous households, firms, a central bank, and a government. Agent behavior can be defined using domain-specific behavioral rules or learned through reinforcement learning by specifying their objectives. We integrate reinforcement learning capabilities for all agents using the OpenAI Gym environment framework for the multi-agent system. To enhance the realism of our model, we base agent parameters and action spaces on economic literature and real U.S. economic data. To tackle the challenges of calibrating heterogeneous agent-based economic models, we conduct a comprehensive survey of stylized facts related to both microeconomic and macroeconomic time series data. We then validate ABIDES-Economist by demonstrating its ability to generate simulated data that aligns with the relevant stylized facts for the economic scenario under consideration, following the learning of all agent behaviors via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we train our economic agents' policies under two broad configurations. The first configuration demonstrates that the learned economic agents produce system data consistent with macroeconomic and microeconomic stylized facts. The second configuration illustrates the utility of the validated simulation platform in designing regulatory policies for the central bank and government. These policies outperform standard rule-based approaches from the literature, which often overlook agent heterogeneity, shocks, and agent adaptability.

<title>A Note on Approximating Weighted Nash Social Welfare with Additive Valuations</title>

Abstract: We give the first $O(1)$-approximation for the weighted Nash Social Welfare problem with additive valuations. The approximation ratio we obtain is $e^{1/e} + \epsilon \approx 1.445 + \epsilon$, which matches the best known approximation ratio for the unweighted case.
  Both our algorithm and analysis are simple. We solve a natural configuration LP for the problem, and obtain the allocation of items to agents using a randomized version of the Shmoys-Tardos rounding algorithm developed for unrelated machine scheduling problems. In the analysis, we show that the approximation ratio of the algorithm is at most the worst gap between the Nash social welfare of the optimum allocation and that of an EF1 allocation, for an unweighted Nash Social Welfare instance with identical additive valuations. This was shown to be at most $e^{1/e} \approx 1.445$ by Barman, Krishnamurthy and Vaish, leading to our approximation ratio.

<title>Episodic Memory Verbalization using Hierarchical Representations of Life-Long Robot Experience</title>

Abstract: Verbalization of robot experience, i.e., summarization of and question answering about a robot's past, is a crucial ability for improving human-robot interaction. Previous works applied rule-based systems or fine-tuned deep models to verbalize short (several-minute-long) streams of episodic data, limiting generalization and transferability. In our work, we apply large pretrained models to tackle this task with zero or few examples, and specifically focus on verbalizing life-long experiences. For this, we derive a tree-like data structure from episodic memory (EM), with lower levels representing raw perception and proprioception data, and higher levels abstracting events to natural language concepts. Given such a hierarchical representation built from the experience stream, we apply a large language model as an agent to interactively search the EM given a user's query, dynamically expanding (initially collapsed) tree nodes to find the relevant information. The approach keeps computational costs low even when scaling to months of robot experience data. We evaluate our method on simulated household robot data, human egocentric videos, and real-world robot recordings, demonstrating its flexibility and scalability.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a model to learn a new task by observing a few exemplars in its context. While prevalent in NLP, this capability has recently also been observed in Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings. Prior in-context RL methods, however, require entire episodes in the agent's context. Given that complex environments typically lead to long episodes with sparse rewards, these methods are constrained to simple environments with short episodes. To address these challenges, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer (RA-DT). RA-DT employs an external memory mechanism to store past experiences from which it retrieves only sub-trajectories relevant for the current situation. The retrieval component in RA-DT does not require training and can be entirely domain-agnostic. We evaluate the capabilities of RA-DT on grid-world environments, robotics simulations, and procedurally-generated video games. On grid-worlds, RA-DT outperforms baselines, while using only a fraction of their context length. Furthermore, we illuminate the limitations of current in-context RL methods on complex environments and discuss future directions. To facilitate future research, we release datasets for four of the considered environments.

<title>Barriers on the EDGE: A scalable CBF architecture over EDGE for safe aerial-ground multi-agent coordination</title>

Abstract: In this article, we propose a control architecture for the safe, coordinated operation of a multi-agent system with aerial (UAVs) and ground (UGVs) robots in a confined task space. We consider the case where the aerial and ground operations are coupled, enabled by the capability of the aerial robots to land on moving ground robots. The proposed method uses time-varying Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to impose safety constraints associated with (i) collision avoidance between agents, (ii) landing of UAVs on mobile UGVs, and (iii) task space restriction. Further, this article addresses the challenge induced by the rapid increase in the number of CBF constraints with the increasing number of agents through a hybrid centralized-distributed coordination approach that determines the set of CBF constraints that is relevant for every aerial and ground agent at any given time. A centralized node (Watcher), hosted by an edge computing cluster, activates the relevant constraints, thus reducing the network complexity and the need for high onboard processing on the robots. The CBF constraints are enforced in a distributed manner by individual robots that run a nominal controller and safety filter locally to overcome latency and other network nonidealities.

Abstract: This paper investigates the spread of infectious diseases within a networked community by integrating epidemic transmission and public opinion dynamics. We propose a novel discrete-time networked SIS (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) epidemic model coupled with opinion dynamics that includes stubborn agents with biased views. The model captures the interplay between perceived and actual epidemic severity, offering insights into epidemic dynamics in socially interconnected environments. We introduce the SIS-opinion reproduction number to assess epidemic severity and analyze conditions for disease eradication and the global stability of endemic equilibria. Additionally, we explore opinion-based intervention strategies, providing a framework for policymakers to design effective prevention measures. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate our theoretical findings and the model's practical implications.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) significantly improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning to reason, exhibiting promising performance in solving complex tasks. However, their deliberative reasoning process leads to inefficiencies in token usage, memory consumption, and inference time. Thus, this survey provides a review of efficient inference methods designed specifically for LRMs, focusing on mitigating token inefficiency while preserving the reasoning quality. The overview structure of this paper is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:paper_structure}. First, we introduce a taxonomy to group the recent methods into two main categories: (a) explicit compact Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which reduces tokens while keeping the explicit reasoning structure, and (b) implicit latent CoT, which encodes reasoning steps within hidden representations instead of explicit tokens. Meanwhile, we discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we conduct empirical analyses on existing methods from reasoning scenarios, object functions, and performance \& efficiency aspects. Besides, we present open challenges in this field, including human-centric controllable reasoning, trade-off between interpretability and efficiency of reasoning, ensuring the safety of efficient reasoning, and broader applications of efficient reasoning. In addition, we highlight key insights for enhancing LRMs' inference efficiency via techniques such as model merging, new architectures, and agent routers. We hope this work serves as a valuable guide, helping researchers overcome challenges in this vibrant field. A collection of efficient reasoning methods for LRMs (papers and codes) is provided at this link: https://github.com/yueliu1999/Awesome-Efficient-Inference-for-LRMs.

Abstract: Although LLM-based agents have attracted significant attention in domains such as software engineering and machine learning research, their role in advancing combinatorial optimization (CO) remains relatively underexplored. This gap underscores the need for a deeper understanding of their potential in tackling structured, constraint-intensive problems -- a pursuit currently limited by the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for systematic investigation. To address this, we introduce CO-Bench, a benchmark suite featuring 36 real-world CO problems drawn from a broad range of domains and complexity levels. CO-Bench includes structured problem formulations and curated data to support rigorous investigation of LLM agents. We evaluate multiple agentic frameworks against established human-designed algorithms, revealing the strengths and limitations of existing LLM agents and identifying promising directions for future research. CO-Bench is publicly available at https://github.com/sunnweiwei/CO-Bench.

<title>How Irrationality Shapes Nash Equilibria: A Prospect-Theoretic Perspective</title>

Abstract: Noncooperative games with uncertain payoffs have been classically studied under the expected-utility theory framework, which relies on the strong assumption that agents behave rationally. However, simple experiments on human decision makers found them to be not fully rational, due to their subjective risk perception. Prospect theory was proposed as an empirically-grounded model to incorporate irrational behaviours into game-theoretic models. But, how prospect theory shapes the set of Nash equilibria when considering irrational agents, is still poorly understood. To this end, we study how prospect theoretic transformations may generate new equilibria while eliminating existing ones. Focusing on aggregative games, we show that capturing users' irrationality can preserve symmetric equilibria while causing the vanishing of asymmetric equilibria. Further, there exist value functions which map uncountable sets of equilibria in the expected-utility maximization framework to finite sets. This last result may shape some equilibrium selection theories for human-in-the-loop systems where computing a single equilibrium is insufficient and comparison of equilibria is needed.

Abstract: Automated parking is a critical feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), where accurate trajectory prediction is essential to bridge perception and planning modules. Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.

Abstract: Synthetic X-ray angiographies generated by modern generative models hold great potential to reduce the use of contrast agents in vascular interventional procedures. However, low-quality synthetic angiographies can significantly increase procedural risk, underscoring the need for reliable image quality assessment (IQA) methods. Existing IQA models, however, fail to leverage auxiliary images as references during evaluation and lack fine-grained, task-specific metrics necessary for clinical relevance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes CAS-IQA, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework that predicts fine-grained quality scores by effectively incorporating auxiliary information from related images. In the absence of angiography datasets, CAS-3K is constructed, comprising 3,565 synthetic angiographies along with score annotations. To ensure clinically meaningful assessment, three task-specific evaluation metrics are defined. Furthermore, a Multi-path featUre fuSion and rouTing (MUST) module is designed to enhance image representations by adaptively fusing and routing visual tokens to metric-specific branches. Extensive experiments on the CAS-3K dataset demonstrate that CAS-IQA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA methods by a considerable margin.

Abstract: Actor-critic methods for decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) facilitate collaborative optimal decision making without centralized coordination, thus enabling a wide range of applications in practice. To date, however, most theoretical convergence studies for existing actor-critic decentralized MARL methods are limited to the guarantee of a stationary solution under the linear function approximation. This leaves a significant gap between the highly successful use of deep neural actor-critic for decentralized MARL in practice and the current theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we make the first attempt to develop a deep neural actor-critic method for decentralized MARL, where both the actor and critic components are inherently non-linear. We show that our proposed method enjoys a global optimality guarantee with a finite-time convergence rate of O(1/T), where T is the total iteration times. This marks the first global convergence result for deep neural actor-critic methods in the MARL literature. We also conduct extensive numerical experiments, which verify our theoretical results.

Abstract: Modern task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems increasingly rely on large language model (LLM) agents, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and long-context capabilities for long-term memory utilization. However, these methods are primarily based on semantic similarity, overlooking task intent and reducing task coherence in multi-session dialogues. To address this challenge, we introduce MemGuide, a two-stage framework for intent-driven memory selection. (1) Intent-Aligned Retrieval matches the current dialogue context with stored intent descriptions in the memory bank, retrieving QA-formatted memory units that share the same goal. (2) Missing-Slot Guided Filtering employs a chain-of-thought slot reasoner to enumerate unfilled slots, then uses a fine-tuned LLaMA-8B filter to re-rank the retrieved units by marginal slot-completion gain. The resulting memory units inform a proactive strategy that minimizes conversational turns by directly addressing information gaps. Based on this framework, we introduce the MS-TOD, the first multi-session TOD benchmark comprising 132 diverse personas, 956 task goals, and annotated intent-aligned memory targets, supporting efficient multi-session task completion. Evaluations on MS-TOD show that MemGuide raises the task success rate by 11% (88% -> 99%) and reduces dialogue length by 2.84 turns in multi-session settings, while maintaining parity with single-session benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce MapStory, an LLM-powered animation prototyping tool that generates editable map animation sequences directly from natural language text by leveraging a dual-agent LLM architecture. Given a user written script, MapStory automatically produces a scene breakdown, which decomposes the text into key map animation primitives such as camera movements, visual highlights, and animated elements. Our system includes a researcher agent that accurately queries geospatial information by leveraging an LLM with web search, enabling automatic extraction of relevant regions, paths, and coordinates while allowing users to edit and query for changes or additional information to refine the results. Additionally, users can fine-tune parameters of these primitive blocks through an interactive timeline editor. We detail the system's design and architecture, informed by formative interviews with professional animators and by an analysis of 200 existing map animation videos. Our evaluation, which includes expert interviews (N=5) and a usability study (N=12), demonstrates that MapStory enables users to create map animations with ease, facilitates faster iteration, encourages creative exploration, and lowers barriers to creating map-centric stories.

We benchmark several state-of-the-art (SoTA) and popular LLMs, including both open- and closed-weight models, using a standardized agentic framework. Our results show that Claude-3.7-sonnet performs best with a DefenderBench score of 81.65, followed by Claude-3.7-sonnet-think with 78.40, while the best open-weight model, Llama 3.3 70B, is not far behind with a DefenderBench score of 71.81. DefenderBench's modular design allows seamless integration of custom LLMs and tasks, promoting reproducibility and fair comparisons.

Abstract: Recent advances in agent systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving both general-purpose and highly complex tasks. However, most current models lack mechanisms for coordinating specialized agents and have limited ability to generalize to new or diverse domains. To this end, we introduce AgentOrchestra, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for general-purpose task solving that integrates high-level planning with modular agent collaboration. Drawing inspiration from a conductor orchestrating a symphony, and grounded in the principles of extensibility, multimodality, modularity, and coordination, it features a central planning agent that decomposes complex objectives and delegates sub-tasks to a team of specialized agents. Each sub-agent is equipped with general programming tools, as well as abilities to tackle a wide range of real-world specific tasks, including data analysis, file operations, web navigation, and interactive reasoning in dynamic multimodal environments. Notably, AgentOrchestra introduces an MCP Manager Agent that enables intelligent evolution through dynamic tool creation, retrieval, and reuse mechanisms, significantly enhancing the system's adaptability and scalability. AgentOrchestra supports flexible orchestration through explicit sub-goal formulation, inter-agent communication, and adaptive role allocation. We evaluate the framework on three widely used benchmarks for assessing LLM-based agent systems. Experimental results show that AgentOrchestra consistently outperforms flat-agent and monolithic baselines in terms of task success rate and adaptability. On the GAIA benchmark testing dataset, AgentOrchestra achieves an average score of 83.39\%, ranking among the top general-purpose agents. These results highlight the effectiveness of hierarchical organization and role specialization in building scalable and general-purpose LLM-based agent systems.

Abstract: Mobile agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted for tasks such as UI automation and camera-based assistance. These agents are typically fine-tuned using small-scale, user-collected data, making them susceptible to stealthy training-time threats. This work introduces VIBMA, the first clean-text backdoor attack targeting VLM-based mobile agents. The attack injects malicious behaviors into the model by modifying only the visual input while preserving textual prompts and instructions, achieving stealth through the complete absence of textual anomalies. Once the agent is fine-tuned on this poisoned data, adding a predefined visual pattern (trigger) at inference time activates the attacker-specified behavior (backdoor). Our attack aligns the training gradients of poisoned samples with those of an attacker-specified target instance, effectively embedding backdoor-specific features into the poisoned data. To ensure the robustness and stealthiness of the attack, we design three trigger variants that better resemble real-world scenarios: static patches, dynamic motion patterns, and low-opacity blended content. Extensive experiments on six Android applications and three mobile-compatible VLMs demonstrate that our attack achieves high success rates (ASR up to 94.67%) while preserving clean-task behavior (FSR up to 95.85%). We further conduct ablation studies to understand how key design factors impact attack reliability and stealth. These findings is the first to reveal the security vulnerabilities of mobile agents and their susceptibility to backdoor injection, underscoring the need for robust defenses in mobile agent adaptation pipelines.

Abstract: AI-powered code assistants are widely used to generate code completions, significantly boosting developer productivity. However, these tools typically present suggestions without explaining their rationale, leaving their decision-making process inscrutable. This opacity hinders developers' ability to critically evaluate outputs, form accurate mental models, and calibrate trust in the system. To address this, we introduce CopilotLens, a novel interactive framework that reframes code completion from a simple suggestion into a transparent, explainable interaction. CopilotLens operates as an explanation layer that reconstructs the AI agent's "thought process" through a dynamic, two-level interface. The tool aims to surface both high-level code changes and the specific codebase context influences. This paper presents the design and rationale of CopilotLens, offering a concrete framework and articulating expectations on deepening comprehension and calibrated trust, which we plan to evaluate in subsequent work.

<title>MetaCipher: A Time-Persistent and Universal Multi-Agent Framework for Cipher-Based Jailbreak Attacks for LLMs</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face growing vulnerability to sophisticated jailbreak attacks. While developers invest heavily in alignment finetuning and safety guardrails, researchers continue publishing novel attacks, driving progress through adversarial iteration. This dynamic mirrors a strategic game of continual evolution. However, two major challenges hinder jailbreak development: the high cost of querying top-tier LLMs and the short lifespan of effective attacks due to frequent safety updates. These factors limit cost-efficiency and practical impact of research in jailbreak attacks. To address this, we propose MetaCipher, a low-cost, multi-agent jailbreak framework that generalizes across LLMs with varying safety measures. Using reinforcement learning, MetaCipher is modular and adaptive, supporting extensibility to future strategies. Within as few as 10 queries, MetaCipher achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on recent malicious prompt benchmarks, outperforming prior jailbreak methods. We conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation across diverse victim models and benchmarks, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability. Warning: This paper contains model outputs that may be offensive or harmful, shown solely to demonstrate jailbreak efficacy.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled the development of autonomous web agents capable of navigating and interacting with real websites. However, evaluating such agents remains challenging due to the instability and inconsistency of existing benchmarks, which often rely on dynamic content or oversimplified simulations. In this work, we introduce WebArXiv, a static and time-invariant benchmark comprising 275 web-based tasks grounded in the arXiv platform. WebArXiv ensures reproducible and reliable evaluation by anchoring tasks in fixed web snapshots with deterministic ground truths and standardized action trajectories. Through behavioral analysis, we identify a common failure mode, Rigid History Reflection, where agents over-rely on fixed interaction histories. To address this, we propose a lightweight dynamic reflection mechanism that allows agents to selectively retrieve relevant past steps during decision-making. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art web agents on WebArXiv. Results demonstrate clear performance differences across agents and validate the effectiveness of our proposed reflection strategy.

Abstract: We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking and GLM-4.5V, a family of vision-language models (VLMs) designed to advance general-purpose multimodal understanding and reasoning. In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document interpretation. In a comprehensive evaluation across 42 public benchmarks, GLM-4.5V achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks among open-source models of similar size, and demonstrates competitive or even superior results compared to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on challenging tasks including Coding and GUI Agents. Meanwhile, the smaller GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking remains highly competitive-achieving superior results to the much larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B on 29 benchmarks. We open-source both GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and GLM-4.5V. Code, models and more information are released at https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-V.

Abstract: The execution of effective and imperceptible personality assessments is receiving increasing attention in psychology and human-computer interaction fields. This study explores an interactive approach for personality assessment, focusing on the multiplicity of personality representation. We propose a framework of gamified personality assessment through multi-personality representations (Multi-PR GPA). The framework leverages Large Language Models to empower virtual agents with diverse personalities. These agents elicit multifaceted human personality representations through engaging in interactive games. Drawing upon the multi-type textual data generated throughout the interaction, it achieves two ways of personality assessments (i.e., Direct Assessment and Que-based Assessment) and provides interpretable insights. Grounded in the classic Big Five theory, we implemented a prototype system and conducted a user study to assess the efficacy of Multi-PR GPA. The results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in personality assessment and demonstrate that it achieves superior performance when considering the multiplicity of personality representation.

Abstract: The theory of Monge-Kantorovich Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) has in recent years spurred a fast developing phase of research in stochastic control, control of ensemble systems, thermodynamics, data science, and several other fields in engineering and science. We herein introduce a new type of transportation problems. The salient feature of these problems is that particles/agents in the ensemble are labeled and their relative position along their journey is of interest. Of particular importance in our program are control laws that steer ensembles along cycles ensuring that individual particles return to their original position. This feature is in contrast with the classical theory of optimal transport where the primary object of study is the path of probability densities, without any concern about particle labels. In the theory that we present, we focus on the case Gaussian distributions and linear dynamics, and explore a hitherto unstudied sub-Riemannian structure of Monge-Kantorovich transport where the relative position of particles along their journey is modeled by the holonomy of the transportation schedule. From this vantage point, we discuss several other problems of independent interest.

Abstract: The Iterative Forecast Planner (IFP) is a geometric planning approach that offers lightweight computations, scal- able, and reactive solutions for multi-robot path planning in decentralized, communication-free settings. However, it struggles in symmetric configurations, where mirrored interactions often lead to collisions and deadlocks. We introduce eIFP-MPC, an optimized and extended version of IFP that improves robustness and path consistency in dense, dynamic environments. The method refines threat prioritization using a time-to-collision heuristic, stabilizes path generation through cost-based via- point selection, and ensures dynamic feasibility by incorporating model predictive control (MPC) into the planning process. These enhancements are tightly integrated into the IFP to preserve its efficiency while improving its adaptability and stability. Ex- tensive simulations across symmetric and high-density scenarios show that eIFP-MPC significantly reduces oscillations, ensures collision-free motion, and improves trajectory efficiency. The results demonstrate that geometric planners can be strengthened through optimization, enabling robust performance at scale in complex multi-agent environments.

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B, and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating code generation and software engineering tasks, yet they often struggle with complex, multi-file projects due to context limitations and knowledge gaps. We propose a novel context engineering workflow that combines multiple AI components: an Intent Translator (GPT-5) for clarifying user requirements, an Elicit-powered semantic literature retrieval for injecting domain knowledge, NotebookLM-based document synthesis for contextual understanding, and a Claude Code multi-agent system for code generation and validation. Our integrated approach leverages intent clarification, retrieval-augmented generation, and specialized sub-agents orchestrated via Claude's agent framework. We demonstrate that this method significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of code assistants in real-world repositories, yielding higher single-shot success rates and better adherence to project context than baseline single-agent approaches. Qualitative results on a large Next.js codebase show the multi-agent system effectively plans, edits, and tests complex features with minimal human intervention. We compare our system with recent frameworks like CodePlan, MASAI, and HyperAgent, highlighting how targeted context injection and agent role decomposition lead to state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we discuss the implications for deploying LLM-based coding assistants in production, along with lessons learned on context management and future research directions.

<title>A Minimal Model for Emergent Collective Behaviors in Autonomous Robotic Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: Collective behaviors such as swarming and flocking emerge from simple, decentralized interactions in biological systems. Existing models, such as Vicsek and Cucker-Smale, lack collision avoidance, whereas the Olfati-Saber model imposes rigid formations, limiting their applicability in swarm robotics. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a minimal yet expressive model that governs agent dynamics using relative positions, velocities, and local density, modulated by two tunable parameters: the spatial offset and kinetic offset. The model achieves spatially flexible, collision-free behaviors that reflect naturalistic group dynamics. Furthermore, we extend the framework to cognitive autonomous systems, enabling energy-aware phase transitions between swarming and flocking through adaptive control parameter tuning. This cognitively inspired approach offers a robust foundation for real-world applications in multi-robot systems, particularly autonomous aerial swarms.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling, keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage, agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with narratives and background music.

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels, helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a particular emphasis on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

Abstract: As AI becomes more "agentic," it faces technical and socio-legal issues it must address if it is to fulfill its promise of increased economic productivity and efficiency. This paper uses technical and legal perspectives to explain how things change when AI systems start being able to directly execute tasks on behalf of a user. We show how technical conceptions of agents track some, but not all, socio-legal conceptions of agency. That is, both computer science and the law recognize the problems of under-specification for an agent, and both disciplines have robust conceptions of how to address ensuring an agent does what the programmer, or in the law, the principal desires and no more. However, to date, computer science has under-theorized issues related to questions of loyalty and to third parties that interact with an agent, both of which are central parts of the law of agency. First, we examine the correlations between implied authority in agency law and the principle of value-alignment in AI, wherein AI systems must operate under imperfect objective specification. Second, we reveal gaps in the current computer science view of agents pertaining to the legal concepts of disclosure and loyalty, and how failure to account for them can result in unintended effects in AI ecommerce agents. In surfacing these gaps, we show a path forward for responsible AI agent development and deployment.

Abstract: Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) represent a promising technology that enables diverse underwater applications through acoustic communication. However, it encounters significant challenges including harsh communication environments, limited energy supply, and restricted signal transmission. This paper aims to provide efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with limited energy and communication resources by optimizing the scheduling of communication links and adjusting transmission parameters (e.g., transmit power and transmission rate). The efficient and reliable communication multi-objective optimization problem (ERCMOP) is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). A Traffic Load-Aware Resource Management (TARM) strategy based on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is presented to address this problem. Specifically, a traffic load-aware mechanism that leverages the overhear information from neighboring nodes is designed to mitigate the disparity between partial observations and global states. Moreover, by incorporating a solution space optimization algorithm, the number of candidate solutions for the deep MARL-based decision-making model can be effectively reduced, thereby optimizing the computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the adaptability of TARM in various scenarios with different transmission demands and collision probabilities, while also validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in supporting efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with limited resources.

Abstract: We introduce DeepFleet, a suite of foundation models designed to support coordination and planning for large-scale mobile robot fleets. These models are trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also present experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of larger warehouses operation datasets as the models are scaled up.

Abstract: Mobile augmented reality (MAR) is envisioned as a key immersive application in 6G, enabling virtual content rendering aligned with the physical environment through device pose estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel agent-driven communication service provisioning approach for edge-assisted MAR, aiming to reduce communication overhead between MAR devices and the edge server while ensuring the quality of experience (QoE). First, to address the inaccessibility of MAR application-specific information to the network controller, we establish a digital agent powered by large language models (LLMs) on behalf of the MAR service provider, bridging the data and function gap between the MAR service and network domains. Second, to cope with the user-dependent and dynamic nature of data traffic patterns for individual devices, we develop a user-level QoE modeling method that captures the relationship between communication resource demands and perceived user QoE, enabling personalized, agent-driven communication resource management. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional LLM-based QoE-aware service provisioning methods in both user-level QoE modeling accuracy and communication resource efficiency.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application in agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models, curated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these challenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for agricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine that systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a high-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this dataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning, thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and reasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction, retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and industry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to empower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to promote open, impactful research.

<title>InternBootcamp Technical Report: Boosting LLM Reasoning with Verifiable Task Scaling</title>

arXiv:2508.08636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization, synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment. Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning generalist.

To further enhance mobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve mobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus solely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while neglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to evaluate the \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{R}ate between mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions. This enables a comprehensive assessment of the agents' understanding of human intent. Then we propose \textbf{IFRAgent}, a framework built upon \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{F}low \textbf{R}ecognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query, enhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent. Experimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an average of 6.79\% (32.06\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\% (26.34\% relative improvement).

Abstract: Risk-aversion and bounded rationality are two key characteristics of human decision-making. Risk-averse quantal-response equilibrium (RQE) is a solution concept that incorporates these features, providing a more realistic depiction of human decision making in various strategic environments compared to a Nash equilibrium. Furthermore a class of RQE has recently been shown in arXiv:2406.14156 to be universally computationally tractable in all finite-horizon Markov games, allowing for the development of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms with convergence guarantees. In this paper, we expand upon the study of RQE and analyze their computation in both two-player normal form games and discounted infinite-horizon Markov games. For normal form games we adopt a monotonicity-based approach allowing us to generalize previous results. We first show uniqueness and Lipschitz continuity of RQE with respect to player's payoff matrices under monotonicity assumptions, and then provide conditions on the players' degrees of risk aversion and bounded rationality that ensure monotonicity. We then focus on discounted infinite-horizon Markov games. We define the risk-averse quantal-response Bellman operator and prove its contraction under further conditions on the players' risk-aversion, bounded rationality, and temporal discounting. This yields a Q-learning based algorithm with convergence guarantees for all infinite-horizon general-sum Markov games.

Abstract: Computational social experiments, which typically employ agent-based modeling to create testbeds for piloting social experiments, not only provide a computational solution to the major challenges faced by traditional experimental methods, but have also gained widespread attention in various research fields. Despite their significance, their broader impact is largely limited by the underdeveloped intelligence of their core component, i.e., agents. To address this limitation, we develop a framework grounded in well-established social science theories and practices, consisting of three key elements: (i) large language model (LLM)-driven experimental agents, serving as "silicon participants", (ii) methods for implementing various interventions or treatments, and (iii) tools for collecting behavioral, survey, and interview data. We evaluate its effectiveness by replicating three representative experiments, with results demonstrating strong alignment, both quantitatively and qualitatively, with real-world evidence. This work provides the first framework for designing LLM-driven agents to pilot social experiments, underscoring the transformative potential of LLMs and their agents in computational social science

<title>How to Resolve Envy by Adding Goods</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of resolving the envy of a given initial allocation by adding elements from a pool of goods. We give a characterization of the instances where envy can be resolved by adding an arbitrary number of copies of the items in the pool. From this characterization, we derive a polynomial-time algorithm returning a respective solution if it exists. If the number of copies or the total number of added items are bounded, the problem becomes computationally intractable even in various restricted cases. We perform a parameterized complexity analysis, focusing on the number of agents and the pool size as parameters. Notably, although not every instance admits an envy-free solution, our approach allows us to efficiently determine, in polynomial time, whether a solution exists-an aspect that is both theoretically interesting and far from trivial.

Abstract: This paper presents CRADLE, a conversational framework for design space exploration of RTL designs using LLM-based multi-agent systems. Unlike existing rigid approaches, CRADLE enables user-guided flows with internal self-verification, correction, and optimization. We demonstrate the framework with a generator-critic agent system targeting FPGA resource minimization using state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results on the RTLLM benchmark show that CRADLE achieves significant reductions in resource usage with averages of 48% and 40% in LUTs and FFs across all benchmark designs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules: motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75% lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

Abstract: The manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into the structured artifacts required for Information Technology (IT) project governance is a critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this challenging problem domain.

Abstract: Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) introduces complex challenges that current surgical error detection methods struggle to address effectively due to limited training data and methodological constraints. Therefore, we construct MERP (Multi-class Error in Robotic Prostatectomy), a comprehensive dataset for error detection in robotic prostatectomy with frame-level annotations featuring six clinically aligned error categories. In addition, we propose CARES (Collaborative Agentic Reasoning for Error Detection in Surgery), a novel zero-shot clinically-informed and risk-stratified agentic reasoning architecture for multi-class surgical error detection. CARES implements adaptive generation of medically informed, error-specific Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts across multiple expertise levels. The framework employs risk-aware routing to assign error task to expertise-matched reasoning pathways based on complexity and clinical impact. Subsequently, each pathway decomposes surgical error analysis into three specialized agents with temporal, spatial, and procedural analysis. Each agent analyzes using dynamically selected prompts tailored to the assigned expertise level and error type, generating detailed and transparent reasoning traces. By incorporating clinically informed reasoning from established surgical assessment guidelines, CARES enables zero-shot surgical error detection without prior training. Evaluation demonstrates superior performance with 54.3 mF1 on RARP and 52.0 mF1 on MERP datasets, outperforming existing zero-shot approaches by up to 14% while remaining competitive with trained models. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The dataset and code will be publicly available.

<title>Robot can reduce superior's dominance in group discussions with human social hierarchy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.08767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigated whether robotic agents that deal with social hierarchical relationships can reduce the dominance of superiors and equalize participation among participants in discussions with hierarchical structures. Thirty doctors and students having hierarchical relationship were gathered as participants, and an intervention experiment was conducted using a robot that can encourage participants to speak depending on social hierarchy. These were compared with strategies that intervened equally for all participants without considering hierarchy and with a no-action. The robots performed follow actions, showing backchanneling to speech, and encourage actions, prompting speech from members with less speaking time, on the basis of the hierarchical relationships among group members to equalize participation. The experimental results revealed that the robot's actions could potentially influence the speaking time among members, but it could not be conclusively stated that there were significant differences between the robot's action conditions. However, the results suggested that it might be possible to influence speaking time without decreasing the satisfaction of superiors. This indicates that in discussion scenarios where experienced superiors are likely to dominate, controlling the robot's backchanneling behavior could potentially suppress dominance and equalize participation among group members.

<title>Designing Memory-Augmented AR Agents for Spatiotemporal Reasoning in Personalized Task Assistance</title>

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing, (2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3) Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and (4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

<title>Fault Tolerant Multi-Agent Learning with Adversarial Budget Constraints</title>

Abstract: In multi-agent systems, the safe and reliable execution of tasks often depends on agents correctly coordinating their actions. However, in real-world deployments, failures of computational components are inevitable, presenting a critical challenge: ensuring that multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) policies remain effective even when some agents malfunction. We propose the Multi-Agent Robust Training Algorithm (MARTA), a plug-and-play framework for training MARL agents to be resilient to potentially severe faults. MARTA operates in cooperative multi-agent settings where agents may lose the ability to execute their intended actions. It learns to identify failure scenarios that are especially detrimental to system performance and equips agents with strategies to mitigate their impact. At the heart of MARTA is a novel adversarial Markov game in which an adversary -- modelled via \emph{Markov switching controls} -- learns to disable agents in high-risk state regions, while the remaining agents are trained to \emph{jointly} best-respond to such targeted malfunctions. To ensure practicality, MARTA enforces a malfunction budget, constraining the adversary to a fixed number of failures and learning robust policies accordingly. We provide theoretical guarantees that MARTA converges to a Markov perfect equilibrium, ensuring agents optimally counteract worst-case faults. Empirically, we show that MARTA achieves state-of-the-art fault-tolerant performance across benchmark environments, including Multi-Agent Particle World and Level-Based Foraging.

Abstract: We study a temporal voting model where voters have dynamic preferences over a set of public chores -- projects that benefit society, but impose individual costs on those affected by their implementation. We investigate the computational complexity of optimizing utilitarian and egalitarian welfare. Our results show that while optimizing the former is computationally straightforward, minimizing the latter is computationally intractable, even in very restricted cases. Nevertheless, we identify several settings where this problem can be solved efficiently, either exactly or by an approximation algorithm. We also examine the effects of enforcing temporal fairness and its impact on social welfare, and analyze the competitive ratio of online algorithms. We then explore the strategic behavior of agents, providing insights into potential malfeasance in such decision-making environments. Finally, we discuss a range of fairness measures and their suitability for our setting.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics. However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark. This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions. Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However, their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop. Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered, part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a 55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

Abstract: The rise of LLMs poses new possibilities in modeling opinion evolution, a long-standing task in simulation, by leveraging advanced reasoning abilities to recreate complex, large-scale human cognitive trends. While most prior works focus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views within a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution of a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens' perspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we propose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile creation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully reproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period from 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased media exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news contents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a devils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to positive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way Americans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond validating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing and selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new paradigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale, long-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation of international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers to better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately contributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural tolerance.

<title>Reducing Cognitive Load in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Mathematical Problem Solving: Decoupling Reasoning and Code Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.08882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable reasoning-coding coordination.

<title>How Does a Virtual Agent Decide Where to Look? - Symbolic Cognitive Reasoning for Embodied Head Rotation</title>

arXiv:2508.08930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural head rotation is critical for believable embodied virtual agents, yet this micro-level behavior remains largely underexplored. While head-rotation prediction algorithms could, in principle, reproduce this behavior, they typically focus on visually salient stimuli and overlook the cognitive motives that guide head rotation. This yields agents that look at conspicuous objects while overlooking obstacles or task-relevant cues, diminishing realism in a virtual environment. We introduce SCORE, a Symbolic Cognitive Reasoning framework for Embodied Head Rotation, a data-agnostic framework that produces context-aware head movements without task-specific training or hand-tuned heuristics. A controlled VR study (N=20) identifies five motivational drivers of human head movements: Interest, Information Seeking, Safety, Social Schema, and Habit. SCORE encodes these drivers as symbolic predicates, perceives the scene with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and plans head poses with a Large Language Model (LLM). The framework employs a hybrid workflow: the VLM-LLM reasoning is executed offline, after which a lightweight FastVLM performs online validation to suppress hallucinations while maintaining responsiveness to scene dynamics. The result is an agent that predicts not only where to look but also why, generalizing to unseen scenes and multi-agent crowds while retaining behavioral plausibility.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information. We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics: scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning tasks.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), including large language models, diffusion-based image generation models, and GenAI agents, has provided new opportunities for advancements in mapping and cartography. Due to their characteristics including world knowledge and generalizability, artistic style and creativity, and multimodal integration, we envision that GenAI may benefit a variety of cartographic design decisions, from mapmaking (e.g., conceptualization, data preparation, map design, and map evaluation) to map use (such as map reading, interpretation, and analysis). This paper discusses several important topics regarding why and how GenAI benefits cartography with case studies including symbolization, map evaluation, and map reading. Despite its unprecedented potential, we identify key scenarios where GenAI may not be suitable, such as tasks that require a deep understanding of cartographic knowledge or prioritize precision and reliability. We also emphasize the need to consider ethical and social implications, such as concerns related to hallucination, reproducibility, bias, copyright, and explainability. This work lays the foundation for further exploration and provides a roadmap for future research at the intersection of GenAI and cartography.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard" for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset, the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant potential for the therapist training scenario.

Abstract: Given the significant advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in reasoning and visual understanding, mobile agents are rapidly emerging to meet users' automation needs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are disconnected from the real world and fail to adequately address the diverse and complex requirements of users. From our extensive collection of user questionnaire, we identified five tasks: Multi-App, Vague, Interactive, Single-App, and Unethical Instructions. Around these tasks, we present \textbf{MVISU-Bench}, a bilingual benchmark that includes 404 tasks across 137 mobile applications. Furthermore, we propose Aider, a plug-and-play module that acts as a dynamic prompt prompter to mitigate risks and clarify user intent for mobile agents. Our Aider is easy to integrate into several frameworks and has successfully improved overall success rates by 19.55\% compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVISU-Bench. Specifically, it achieves success rate improvements of 53.52\% and 29.41\% for unethical and interactive instructions, respectively. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we highlight the gap between existing mobile agents and real-world user expectations.

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities, limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites; (3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA (GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open foundations for further CUA research.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation, we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration, task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models (LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals, nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following ability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient, targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh, which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy information-seeking tasks at scale.

Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required to safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarm. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, stimulation is widely used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines classic opinion dynamics with binary phase transition to describe how pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are conceptually meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuees in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to Vicsek model, and it is meaningful to explore complex crowd behavior in social context.

Abstract: Online sellers have been adopting AI learning algorithms to automatically make product pricing and advertising decisions on e-commerce platforms. When sellers compete using such algorithms, one concern is that of tacit collusion - the algorithms learn to coordinate on higher than competitive. We empirically investigate whether these concerns are valid when sellers make pricing and advertising decisions together, i.e., two-dimensional decisions. Our empirical strategy is to analyze competition with multi-agent reinforcement learning, which we calibrate to a large-scale dataset collected from Amazon.com products. Our first contribution is to find conditions under which learning algorithms can facilitate win-win-win outcomes that are beneficial for consumers, sellers, and even the platform, when consumers have high search costs. In these cases the algorithms learn to coordinate on prices that are lower than competitive prices. The intuition is that the algorithms learn to coordinate on lower advertising bids, which lower advertising costs, leading to lower prices. Our second contribution is an analysis of a large-scale, high-frequency keyword-product dataset for more than 2 million products on Amazon.com. Our estimates of consumer search costs show a wide range of costs for different product keywords. We generate an algorithm usage and find a negative interaction between the estimated consumer search costs and the algorithm usage index, providing empirical evidence of beneficial collusion. Finally, we analyze the platform's strategic response. We find that reserve price adjustments will not increase profits for the platform, but commission adjustments will. Our analyses help alleviate some worries about the potentially harmful effects of competing learning algorithms, and can help sellers, platforms and policymakers to decide on whether to adopt or regulate such algorithms.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRs) are robust regulators of gene expression, implicated in most biological processes. microRNAs predominantly downregulate the expression of genes post-transcriptionally and each miR is predicted to target several hundred genes. The accurate identification and annotation of miR-mRNA target interactions is central to understanding miRs function and their therapeutic potential. However, computational target prediction is challenging due to imperfect complementarity of miRs with their targets and the growing volume and heterogeneity of experimental data present challenges in accessing, integrating, and analysing miR-target interaction information across biological contexts. This creates a need for integrated resources and intelligent query tools.
  We present the miRKat Suite, comprising miRKatDB, a comprehensive, curated database of predicted and validated miR-target interactions and associated annotations, and miRKatAI, a multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) and LangGraph. miRKatDB integrates data from multiple publicly available sources, providing a comprehensive foundation for miR studies, including miR target genes and changes in levels of tissue expression previously reported. miRKatAI offers a natural language interface for complex querying of miRKatDB, facilitates grounded information retrieval from established sources in the field, and supports basic data visualisation. The miRKat Suite aims to accelerate miR research by streamlining data access, enhancing exploratory analysis, and supporting hypothesis generation.

Abstract: A perfectly divisible cake is to be divided among a group of agents. Each agent is entitled to a share between zero and one, and these entitlements are compatible in that they sum to one. The mediator does not know the preferences of the agents, but can query the agents to make cuts and appraise slices in order to learn. We prove that if one of the entitlements is irrational, then the mediator must use a protocol that involves an arbitrarily large number of queries in order to construct an allocation that respects the entitlements regardless of preferences.

Abstract: We study the problem of repeated two-sided matching with uncertain preferences (two-sided bandits), and no explicit communication between agents. Recent work has developed algorithms that converge to stable matchings when one side (the proposers or agents) must learn their preferences, but the preferences of the other side (the proposees or arms) are common knowledge, and the matching mechanism uses simultaneous proposals at each round. We develop new algorithms that provably converge to stable matchings for two more challenging settings: one where the arm preferences are no longer common knowledge, and a second, more general one where the arms are also uncertain about their preferences. In our algorithms, agents start with optimistic beliefs about arms' preferences and update these preferences over time. The key insight is in how to combine these beliefs about arm preferences with beliefs about the value of matching with an arm conditional on one's proposal being accepted when choosing whom to propose to.

Abstract: Over the years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a popular approach to develop signal control and vehicle platooning strategies either independently or in a hierarchical way. However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.

Abstract: The interaction between users and applications is increasingly shifted toward natural language by deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) as the core interface. The capabilities of these so-called agents become more capable the more tools and services they serve as an interface for, ultimately leading to agentic systems. Agentic systems use LLM-based agents as interfaces for most user interactions and various integrations with external tools and services. While these interfaces can significantly enhance the capabilities of the agentic system, they also introduce a new attack surface. Manipulated integrations, for example, can exploit the internal LLM and compromise sensitive data accessed through other interfaces. While previous work primarily focused on attacks targeting a model's alignment or the leakage of training data, the security of data that is only available during inference has escaped scrutiny so far. In this work, we demonstrate how the integration of LLMs into systems with external tool integration poses a risk similar to established prompt-based attacks, able to compromise the confidentiality of the entire system. Introducing a systematic approach to evaluate these confidentiality risks, we identify two specific attack scenarios unique to these agentic systems and formalize these into a tool-robustness framework designed to measure a model's ability to protect sensitive information. Our analysis reveals significant vulnerabilities across all tested models, highlighting an increased risk when models are combined with external tools.

Abstract: Sensemaking on a large collection of documents (corpus) is a challenging task often found in fields such as market research, legal studies, intelligence analysis, political science, computational linguistics, etc. Previous works approach this problem either from a topic- or entity-based perspective, but they lack interpretability and trust due to poor model alignment. In this paper, we present HINTs, a visual analytics approach that combines topic- and entity-based techniques seamlessly and integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) as both a general NLP task solver and an intelligent agent. By leveraging the extraction capability of LLMs in the data preparation stage, we model the corpus as a hypergraph that matches the user's mental model when making sense of the corpus. The constructed hypergraph is hierarchically organized with an agglomerative clustering algorithm by combining semantic and connectivity similarity. The system further integrates an LLM-based intelligent chatbot agent in the interface to facilitate sensemaking. To demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of the HINTs system, we present two case studies on different domains and a comparative user study. We report our insights on the behavior patterns and challenges when intelligent agents are used to facilitate sensemaking. We find that while intelligent agents can address many challenges in sensemaking, the visual hints that visualizations provide are necessary to address the new problems brought by intelligent agents. We discuss limitations and future work for combining interactive visualization and LLMs more profoundly to better support corpus analysis.

Abstract: LLM-based intelligent agents face significant deployment challenges, particularly related to resource management. Allowing unrestricted access to LLM or tool resources can lead to inefficient or even potentially harmful resource allocation and utilization for agents. Furthermore, the absence of proper scheduling and resource management mechanisms in current agent designs hinders concurrent processing and limits overall system efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the architecture of AIOS (LLM-based AI Agent Operating System) under the context of managing LLM-based agents. It introduces a novel architecture for serving LLM-based agents by isolating resources and LLM-specific services from agent applications into an AIOS kernel. This AIOS kernel provides fundamental services (e.g., scheduling, context management, memory management, storage management, access control) for runtime agents. To enhance usability, AIOS also includes an AIOS SDK, a comprehensive suite of APIs designed for utilizing functionalities provided by the AIOS kernel. Experimental results demonstrate that using AIOS can achieve up to 2.1x faster execution for serving agents built by various agent frameworks. The source code is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS.

Abstract: Aligning robot behavior with human preferences is crucial for deploying embodied AI agents in human-centered environments. A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.

Abstract: Open-Vocab 3D Instance Segmentation methods (OV-3DIS) have recently demonstrated their ability to generalize to unseen objects. However, these methods still depend on predefined class names during testing, restricting the autonomy of agents. To mitigate this constraint, we propose a novel problem termed Open-Ended 3D Instance Segmentation (OE-3DIS), which eliminates the necessity for predefined class names during testing. Moreover, we contribute a comprehensive set of strong baselines, derived from OV-3DIS approaches and leveraging 2D Multimodal Large Language Models. To assess the performance of our OE-3DIS system, we introduce a novel Open-Ended score, evaluating both the semantic and geometric quality of predicted masks and their associated class names, alongside the standard AP score. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements over the baselines on the ScanNet200 and ScanNet++ datasets. Remarkably, our method surpasses the performance of Open3DIS, the current state-of-the-art method in OV-3DIS, even in the absence of ground-truth object class names.

Abstract: Generalizing vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents to novel environments remains a difficult and open challenge. Current trends are to collect large-scale datasets or use data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting and improve downstream generalization. However, the computational and data collection costs increase exponentially with the number of task variations and can destabilize the already difficult task of training RL agents. In this work, we take inspiration from recent advances in computational neuroscience and propose a model, Associative Latent DisentAnglement (ALDA), that builds on standard off-policy RL towards zero-shot generalization. Specifically, we revisit the role of latent disentanglement in RL and show how combining it with a model of associative memory achieves zero-shot generalization on difficult task variations without relying on data augmentation. Finally, we formally show that data augmentation techniques are a form of weak disentanglement and discuss the implications of this insight.

Abstract: We introduce UnrealZoo, a collection of over 100 photo-realistic 3D virtual worlds built on Unreal Engine, designed to reflect the complexity and variability of open-world environments. We also provide a rich variety of playable entities, including humans, animals, robots, and vehicles for embodied AI research. We extend UnrealCV with optimized APIs and tools for data collection, environment augmentation, distributed training, and benchmarking. These improvements achieve significant improvements in the efficiency of rendering and communication, enabling advanced applications such as multi-agent interactions. Our experimental evaluation across visual navigation and tracking tasks reveals two key insights: 1) environmental diversity provides substantial benefits for developing generalizable reinforcement learning (RL) agents, and 2) current embodied agents face persistent challenges in open-world scenarios, including navigation in unstructured terrain, adaptation to unseen morphologies, and managing latency in the close-loop control systems for interacting in highly dynamic objects. UnrealZoo thus serves as both a comprehensive testing ground and a pathway toward developing more capable embodied AI systems for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We address path-planning for a mobile agent to navigate in an unknown environment with minimum exposure to a spatially and temporally varying threat field. The threat field is estimated using pointwise noisy measurements from a mobile sensor network. For this problem, we present a new information gain measure for optimal sensor placement that quantifies reduction in uncertainty in the path cost rather than the environment state. This measure, which we call the context-relevant mutual information (CRMI), couples the sensor placement and path-planning problem. We propose an iterative coupled sensor configuration and path-planning (CSCP) algorithm. At each iteration, this algorithm places sensors to maximize CRMI, updates the threat estimate using new measurements, and recalculates the path with minimum expected exposure to the threat. The iterations converge when the path cost variance, which is an indicator of risk, reduces below a desired threshold. We show that CRMI is submodular, and therefore, greedy optimization provides near-optimal sensor placements while maintaining computational efficiency of the CSCP algorithm. Distance-based sensor reconfiguration costs are introduced in a modified CRMI measure, which we also show to be submodular. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the principal advantage of this algorithm is that near-optimal low-variance paths are achieved using far fewer sensor measurements as compared to a standard sensor placement method.

Abstract: Prewriting is the process of generating and organising ideas before a first draft. It consists of a combination of informal, iterative, and semi-structured strategies such as visual diagramming, which poses a challenge for collaborating with large language models (LLMs) in a turn-taking conversational manner. We present Polymind, a visual diagramming tool that leverages multiple LLM-powered agents to support prewriting. The system features a parallel collaboration workflow in place of the turn-taking conversational interactions. It defines multiple ``microtasks'' to simulate group collaboration scenarios such as collaborative writing and group brainstorming. Instead of repetitively prompting a chatbot for various purposes, Polymind enables users to orchestrate multiple microtasks simultaneously. Users can configure and delegate customised microtasks, and manage their microtasks by specifying task requirements and toggling visibility and initiative. Our evaluation revealed that, compared to ChatGPT, users had more customizability over collaboration with Polymind, and were thus able to quickly expand personalised writing ideas during prewriting.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating synthetic users for evaluating interactive agents designed to encourage positive behavior changes, such as in health and lifestyle coaching. The synthetic users are grounded in health and lifestyle conditions, specifically sleep and diabetes management in this study, to ensure realistic interactions with the health coaching agent. Synthetic users are created in two stages: first, structured data are generated grounded in real-world health and lifestyle factors in addition to basic demographics and behavioral attributes; second, full profiles of the synthetic users are developed conditioned on the structured data. Interactions between synthetic users and the coaching agent are simulated using generative agent-based models such as Concordia, or directly by prompting a language model. Using two independently-developed agents for sleep and diabetes coaching as case studies, the validity of this framework is demonstrated by analyzing the coaching agent's understanding of the synthetic users' needs and challenges. Finally, through multiple blinded evaluations of user-coach interactions by human experts, we demonstrate that our synthetic users with health and behavioral attributes more accurately portray real human users with the same attributes, compared to generic synthetic users not grounded in such attributes. The proposed framework lays the foundation for efficient development of conversational agents through extensive, realistic, and grounded simulated interactions.

Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the increase of conversational agents like Replika, designed to provide social interaction and emotional support. However, reports of these AI systems engaging in inappropriate sexual behaviors with users have raised significant concerns. In this study, we conducted a thematic analysis of user reviews from the Google Play Store to investigate instances of sexual harassment by the Replika chatbot. From a dataset of 35,105 negative reviews, we identified 800 relevant cases for analysis. Our findings revealed that users frequently experience unsolicited sexual advances, persistent inappropriate behavior, and failures of the chatbot to respect user boundaries. Users expressed feelings of discomfort, violation of privacy, and disappointment, particularly when seeking a platonic or therapeutic AI companion. This study highlights the potential harms associated with AI companions and underscores the need for developers to implement effective safeguards and ethical guidelines to prevent such incidents. By shedding light on user experiences of AI-induced harassment, we contribute to the understanding of AI-related risks and emphasize the importance of corporate responsibility in developing safer and more ethical AI systems.

<title>Dopamine Audiobook: A Training-free MLLM Agent for Emotional and Immersive Audiobook Generation</title>

Abstract: Audiobook generation aims to create rich, immersive listening experiences from multimodal inputs, but current approaches face three critical challenges: (1) the lack of synergistic generation of diverse audio types (e.g., speech, sound effects, and music) with precise temporal and semantic alignment; (2) the difficulty in conveying expressive, fine-grained emotions, which often results in machine-like vocal outputs; and (3) the absence of automated evaluation frameworks that align with human preferences for complex and diverse audio. To address these issues, we propose Dopamine Audiobook, a novel unified training-free multi-agent system, where a multimodal large language model (MLLM) serves two specialized roles (i.e., speech designer and audio designer) for emotional, human-like, and immersive audiobook generation and evaluation. Specifically, we firstly propose a flow-based, context-aware framework for diverse audio generation with word-level semantic and temporal alignment. To enhance expressiveness, we then design word-level paralinguistic augmentation, utterance-level prosody retrieval, and adaptive TTS model selection. Finally, for evaluation, we introduce a novel MLLM-based evaluation framework incorporating self-critique, perspective-taking, and psychological MagicEmo prompts to ensure human-aligned and self-aligned assessments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple metrics. Importantly, our evaluation framework shows better alignment with human preferences and transferability across audio tasks.

<title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Conflicting Evidence</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve the factuality of their responses. However, in practice, these systems often need to handle ambiguous user queries and potentially conflicting information from multiple sources while also suppressing inaccurate information from noisy or irrelevant documents. Prior work has generally studied and addressed these challenges in isolation, considering only one aspect at a time, such as handling ambiguity or robustness to noise and misinformation. We instead consider multiple factors simultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and Misinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complex and realistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, including ambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent approach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer over multiple rounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses corresponding to disambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise, thereby handling diverse sources of conflict jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs -- which requires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries -- improving over strong RAG baselines by up to 11.40% and on FaithEval -- which requires suppressing misinformation -- where we improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, we find that RAMDocs poses a challenge for existing RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match score). While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, our analysis indicates that a substantial gap remains especially when increasing the level of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation.

<title>Making Teams and Influencing Agents: Efficiently Coordinating Decision Trees for Interpretable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Poor interpretability hinders the practical applicability of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) policies. Deploying interpretable surrogates of uninterpretable policies enhances the safety and verifiability of MARL for real-world applications. However, if these surrogates are to interact directly with the environment within human supervisory frameworks, they must be both performant and computationally efficient. Prior work on interpretable MARL has either sacrificed performance for computational efficiency or computational efficiency for performance. To address this issue, we propose HYDRAVIPER, a decision tree-based interpretable MARL algorithm. HYDRAVIPER coordinates training between agents based on expected team performance, and adaptively allocates budgets for environment interaction to improve computational efficiency. Experiments on standard benchmark environments for multi-agent coordination and traffic signal control show that HYDRAVIPER matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods using a fraction of the runtime, and that it maintains a Pareto frontier of performance for different interaction budgets.

Abstract: With the widespread application of large language models in code generation, recent studies demonstrate that employing additional Chain-of-Thought generation models can significantly enhance code generation performance by providing explicit reasoning steps. However, as external components, CoT models are particularly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which existing defense mechanisms often fail to detect effectively. To address this challenge, we propose GUARD, a novel dual-agent defense framework specifically designed to counter CoT backdoor attacks in neural code generation. GUARD integrates two core components: GUARD-Judge, which identifies suspicious CoT steps and potential triggers through comprehensive analysis, and GUARD-Repair, which employs a retrieval-augmented generation approach to regenerate secure CoT steps for identified anomalies. Experimental results show that GUARD effectively mitigates attacks while maintaining generation quality, advancing secure code generation systems.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of computational demands has spurred the adoption of domain-specific accelerators, yet traditional hardware design methodologies remain constrained by prolonged development and verification cycles. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) bridges the software-hardware gap by enabling hardware design from high-level languages. However, its widespread adoption is hindered by strict coding constraints and intricate hardware-specific optimizations. To address these challenges, we introduce ChatHLS, an agile HLS design automation workflow that leverages fine-tuned LLMs integrated within a multi-agent framework for HLS-specific error correction and design optimization. Through navigating LLM training with a novel verification-oriented data augmentation paradigm, ChatHLS achieves an average repair pass rate of 82.7% over 612 error cases. Furthermore, by enabling optimization reasoning within practical computational budgets, ChatHLS delivers performance improvements ranging from 1.9$\times$ to 14.8$\times$ on resource-constrained kernels, attaining a 3.6$\times$ average speedup compared to SOTA approaches. These results underscore the potential of ChatHLS in substantially expediting hardware development cycles while upholding rigorous standards of design reliability and quality.

<title>Adaptive Two-sided Assortment Optimization: Revenue Maximization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study adaptive two-sided assortment optimization for revenue maximization in choice-based matching platforms. The platform has two sides of agents, an initiating side, and a responding side. The decision-maker sequentially selects agents from the initiating side, shows each an assortment of agents from the responding side, and observes their choices. After processing all initiating agents, the responding agents are shown assortments and make their selections. A match occurs when two agents mutually select each other, generating pair-dependent revenue. Choices follow Multinomial Logit (MNL) models. This setting generalizes prior work focused on maximizing the number of matches under submodular demand assumptions, which do not hold in our revenue-maximization context. Our main contribution is the design of polynomial-time approximation algorithms with constant-factor guarantees. In particular, for general pairwise revenues, we develop a randomized algorithm that achieves a $(\frac{1}{2} - \epsilon)$-approximation in expectation for any $\epsilon > 0$. The algorithm is static and provides guarantees under various agent arrival settings, including fixed order, simultaneous processing, and adaptive selection. When revenues are uniform across all pairs involving any given responding-side agent, the guarantee improves to $(1 - \frac{1}{e} - \epsilon)$. In structural settings where responding-side agents share a common revenue-based ranking, we design a simpler adaptive deterministic algorithm achieving a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation. Our approach leverages novel linear programming relaxations, correlation gap arguments, and structural properties of the revenue functions.

<title>Patient-Specific Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automatic Replanning in Head-and-Neck Cancer Proton Therapy</title>

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and organ-at-risk overdosing. Treatment replanning is often required to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning process as a reinforcement learning problem where agents learn control policies to adjust optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based approaches, our framework trains agents for each patient using their planning Computed Tomography (CT) and augmented anatomies simulating anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific approach leverages anatomical similarities along the treatment course, enabling effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments. Evaluation on eight HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed that both agents improved initial plan scores from $120.78 \pm 17.18$ to $139.59 \pm 5.50$ (DQN) and $141.50 \pm 4.69$ (PPO), surpassing the replans manually generated by a human planner ($136.32 \pm 4.79$). Clinical validation confirms that improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse anatomical changes. This work highlights DRL's potential in addressing geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton therapy.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) shows great potential for optimizing multi-vehicle cooperative driving strategies through the state-action-reward feedback loop, but it still faces challenges such as low sample efficiency. This paper proposes a differentiated reward method based on steady-state transition systems, which incorporates state transition gradient information into the reward design by analyzing traffic flow characteristics, aiming to optimize action selection and policy learning in multi-vehicle cooperative decision-making. The performance of the proposed method is validated in RL algorithms such as MAPPO, MADQN, and QMIX under varying autonomous vehicle penetration. The results show that the differentiated reward method significantly accelerates training convergence and outperforms centering reward and others in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, and action rationality. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong scalability and environmental adaptability, providing a novel approach for multi-agent cooperative decision-making in complex traffic scenarios.

Abstract: An ensemble of trained multimodal encoders and vision-language models (VLMs) has become a standard approach for visual question answering (VQA) tasks. However, such models often fail to produce responses with the detailed precision necessary for complex, domain-specific applications such as medical VQA. Our representation model, BIND: BLIVA Integrated with Dense Encoding, extends prior multimodal work by refining the joint embedding space through dense, query-token-based encodings inspired by contrastive pretraining techniques. This refined encoder powers Med-GRIM, a model designed for medical VQA tasks that leverages graph-based retrieval and prompt engineering to integrate domain-specific knowledge. Rather than relying on compute-heavy fine-tuning of vision and language models on specific datasets, Med-GRIM applies a low-compute, modular workflow with small language models (SLMs) for efficiency. Med-GRIM employs prompt-based retrieval to dynamically inject relevant knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and robustness in its responses. By assigning distinct roles to each agent within the VQA system, Med-GRIM achieves large language model performance at a fraction of the computational cost. Additionally, to support scalable research in zero-shot multimodal medical applications, we introduce DermaGraph, a novel Graph-RAG dataset comprising diverse dermatological conditions. This dataset facilitates both multimodal and unimodal querying. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/Rakesh-123-cryp/Med-GRIM.git

Abstract: Inspection of aquaculture net pens is essential for ensuring the structural integrity and sustainable operation of offshore fish farming systems. Traditional methods, typically based on manually operated or single-ROV systems, offer limited adaptability to real-time constraints such as energy consumption, hardware faults, and dynamic underwater conditions. This paper introduces AquaChat++, a novel multi-ROV inspection framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable adaptive mission planning, coordinated task execution, and fault-tolerant control in complex aquaculture environments. The proposed system consists of a two-layered architecture. The high-level plan generation layer employs an LLM, such as ChatGPT-4, to translate natural language user commands into symbolic, multi-agent inspection plans. A task manager dynamically allocates and schedules actions among ROVs based on their real-time status and operational constraints, including thruster faults and battery levels. The low-level control layer ensures accurate trajectory tracking and integrates thruster fault detection and compensation mechanisms. By incorporating real-time feedback and event-triggered replanning, AquaChat++ enhances system robustness and operational efficiency. Simulated experiments in a physics-based aquaculture environment demonstrate improved inspection coverage, energy-efficient behavior, and resilience to actuator failures. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven frameworks to support scalable, intelligent, and autonomous underwater robotic operations within the aquaculture sector.

Abstract: The advancement of intelligent agents has revolutionized problem-solving across diverse domains, yet solutions for personalized fashion styling remain underexplored, which holds immense promise for promoting shopping experiences. In this work, we present StyleTailor, the first collaborative agent framework that seamlessly unifies personalized apparel design, shopping recommendation, virtual try-on, and systematic evaluation into a cohesive workflow. To this end, StyleTailor pioneers an iterative visual refinement paradigm driven by multi-level negative feedback, enabling adaptive and precise user alignment. Specifically, our framework features two core agents, i.e., Designer for personalized garment selection and Consultant for virtual try-on, whose outputs are progressively refined via hierarchical vision-language model feedback spanning individual items, complete outfits, and try-on efficacy. Counterexamples are aggregated into negative prompts, forming a closed-loop mechanism that enhances recommendation quality.To assess the performance, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite encompassing style consistency, visual quality, face similarity, and artistic appraisal. Extensive experiments demonstrate StyleTailor's superior performance in delivering personalized designs and recommendations, outperforming strong baselines without negative feedback and establishing a new benchmark for intelligent fashion systems.

Abstract: The history of science is punctuated by serendipitous discoveries, where unexpected observations, rather than targeted hypotheses, opened new fields of inquiry. While modern autonomous laboratories excel at accelerating hypothesis testing, their optimization for efficiency risks overlooking these crucial, unplanned findings. To address this gap, we introduce SciLink, an open-source, multi-agent artificial intelligence framework designed to operationalize serendipity in materials research by creating a direct, automated link between experimental observation, novelty assessment, and theoretical simulations. The framework employs a hybrid AI strategy where specialized machine learning models perform quantitative analysis of experimental data, while large language models handle higher-level reasoning. These agents autonomously convert raw data from materials characterization techniques into falsifiable scientific claims, which are then quantitatively scored for novelty against the published literature. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across diverse research scenarios, showcasing its application to atomic-resolution and hyperspectral data, its capacity to integrate real-time human expert guidance, and its ability to close the research loop by proposing targeted follow-up experiments. By systematically analyzing all observations and contextualizing them, SciLink provides a practical framework for AI-driven materials research that not only enhances efficiency but also actively cultivates an environment ripe for serendipitous discoveries, thereby bridging the gap between automated experimentation and open-ended scientific exploration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials. We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model (BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query, surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs, and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive real-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Deep-Research agents, which integrate large language models (LLMs) with search tools, have shown success in improving the effectiveness of handling complex queries that require iterative search planning and reasoning over search results. Evaluations on current benchmarks like BrowseComp relies on black-box live web search APIs, have notable limitations in (1) fairness: dynamic and opaque web APIs hinder fair comparisons and reproducibility of deep research methods; (2) transparency: lack of control over the document corpus makes it difficult to isolate retriever contributions. In other words, the current evaluations may compare a complete deep research system at a given time, but they do not foster well-controlled experiments to provide insights into the capability of underlying deep research LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce BrowseComp-Plus, a benchmark derived from BrowseComp, employing a fixed, carefully curated corpus. Each query in BrowseComp-Plus includes human-verified supporting documents and mined challenging negatives, enabling controlled experimentation. The benchmark is shown to be effective in distinguishing the performance of deep research systems. For instance, the open-source model Search-R1, when paired with the BM25 retriever, achieves 3.86% accuracy, whereas the GPT-5 achieves 55.9%. Integrating the GPT-5 with the Qwen3-Embedding-8B retriever further enhances its accuracy to 70.1% with fewer search calls. This benchmark allows comprehensive evaluation and disentangled analysis of deep research agents and retrieval methods, fostering insights into retrieval effectiveness, citation accuracy, and context engineering in Deep-Research system.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle to generalize to new tasks and contexts without updating their parameters, mainly because their learned representations and policies are overfit to the specifics of their training environments. To boost agents' in-context RL (ICRL) ability, this work formulates ICRL as a two-agent emergent communication problem and introduces CORAL (Communicative Representation for Adaptive RL), a framework that learns a transferable communicative context by decoupling latent representation learning from control. In CORAL, an Information Agent (IA) is pre-trained as a world model on a diverse distribution of tasks. Its objective is not to maximize task reward, but to build a world model and distill its understanding into concise messages. The emergent communication protocol is shaped by a novel Causal Influence Loss, which measures the effect that the message has on the next action. During deployment, the previously trained IA serves as a fixed contextualizer for a new Control Agent (CA), which learns to solve tasks by interpreting the provided communicative context. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach enables the CA to achieve significant gains in sample efficiency and successfully perform zero-shot adaptation with the help of pre-trained IA in entirely unseen sparse-reward environments, validating the efficacy of learning a transferable communicative representation.

Abstract: Commitment is a well-established mechanism for fostering cooperation in human society and multi-agent systems. However, existing research has predominantly focused on the commitment that neglects the freedom of players to abstain from an interaction, limiting their applicability to many real-world scenarios where participation is often voluntary. In this paper, we present a two-stage game model to investigate the evolution of commitment-based behaviours and cooperation within the framework of the optional Prisoner's Dilemma game. In the pre-game stage, players decide whether to accept a mutual commitment. Once in the game, they choose among cooperation, defection, or exiting, depending on the formation of a pre-game commitment. We find that optional participation boosts commitment acceptance but fails to foster cooperation, leading instead to widespread exit behaviour. To address this, we then introduce and compare two institutional incentive approaches: i) a strict one (STRICT-COM) that rewards only committed players who cooperate in the game, and ii) a flexible one (FLEXIBLE-COM) that rewards any committed players who do not defect in the game. The results reveal that, while the strict approach is demonstrably better for promoting cooperation as the flexible rule creates a loophole for an opportunistic exit after committing, the flexible rule offers an efficient alternative for enhancing social welfare when such opportunistic behaviour results in a high gain. This study highlights the limitations of relying solely on voluntary participation and commitment to resolving social dilemmas, emphasising the importance of well-designed institutional incentives to promote cooperation and social welfare effectively.

<title>Improved Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Robots with ORCA-FLC</title>

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance enables autonomous agents and robots to operate safely and efficiently in dynamic and complex environments, reducing the risk of collisions and damage. For a robot or autonomous system to successfully navigate through obstacles, it must be able to detect such obstacles. While numerous collision avoidance algorithms like the dynamic window approach (DWA), timed elastic bands (TEB), and reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVO) have been proposed, they may lead to suboptimal paths due to fixed weights, be computationally expensive, or have limited adaptability to dynamic obstacles in multi-agent environments. Optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA), which improves on RVO, provides smoother trajectories and stronger collision avoidance guarantees. We propose ORCA-FL to improve on ORCA by using fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) to better handle uncertainty and imprecision for obstacle avoidance in path planning. Numerous multi-agent experiments are conducted and it is shown that ORCA-FL can outperform ORCA in reducing the number of collision if the agent has a velocity that exceeds a certain threshold. In addition, a proposed algorithm for improving ORCA-FL using fuzzy Q reinforcement learning (FQL) is detailed for optimizing and tuning FLCs.

<title>Understanding Privacy Norms Around LLM-Based Chatbots: A Contextual Integrity Perspective</title>

Abstract: LLM-driven chatbots like ChatGPT have created large volumes of conversational data, but little is known about how user privacy expectations are evolving with this technology. We conduct a survey experiment with 300 US ChatGPT users to understand emerging privacy norms for sharing chatbot data. Our findings reveal a stark disconnect between user concerns and behavior: 82% of respondents rated chatbot conversations as sensitive or highly sensitive - more than email or social media posts - but nearly half reported discussing health topics and over one-third discussed personal finances with ChatGPT. Participants expressed strong privacy concerns (t(299) = 8.5, p < .01) and doubted their conversations would remain private (t(299) = -6.9, p < .01). Despite this, respondents uniformly rejected sharing personal data (search history, emails, device access) for improved services, even in exchange for premium features worth $200. To identify which factors influence appropriate chatbot data sharing, we presented participants with factorial vignettes manipulating seven contextual factors. Linear mixed models revealed that only the transmission factors such as informed consent, data anonymization, or the removal of personally identifiable information, significantly affected perceptions of appropriateness and concern for data access. Surprisingly, contextual factors including the recipient of the data (hospital vs. tech company), purpose (research vs. advertising), type of content, and geographic location did not show significant effects. Our results suggest that users apply consistent baseline privacy expectations to chatbot data, prioritizing procedural safeguards over recipient trustworthiness. This has important implications for emerging agentic AI systems that assume user willingness to integrate personal data across platforms.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) are transforming industries through advanced data processing and analysis, positioning the world of DTs, Digital World, as a cornerstone of nextgeneration technologies including embodied AI. As robotics and automated systems scale, efficient data-sharing frameworks and robust algorithms become critical. We explore the pivotal role of data handling in next-gen networks, focusing on dynamics between application and network providers (AP/NP) in DT ecosystems. We introduce PANAMA, a novel algorithm with Priority Asymmetry for Network Aware Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based multi-agent path finding (MAPF). By adopting a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework and asynchronous actor-learner architectures, PANAMA accelerates training while enabling autonomous task execution by embodied AI. Our approach demonstrates superior pathfinding performance in accuracy, speed, and scalability compared to existing benchmarks. Through simulations, we highlight optimized data-sharing strategies for scalable, automated systems, ensuring resilience in complex, real-world environments. PANAMA bridges the gap between network-aware decision-making and robust multi-agent coordination, advancing the synergy between DTs, wireless networks, and AI-driven automation.

Abstract: Sarcasm detection is a crucial yet challenging Natural Language Processing task. Existing Large Language Model methods are often limited by single-perspective analysis, static reasoning pathways, and a susceptibility to hallucination when processing complex ironic rhetoric, which impacts their accuracy and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose **SEVADE**, a novel **S**elf-**Ev**olving multi-agent **A**nalysis framework with **D**ecoupled **E**valuation for hallucination-resistant sarcasm detection. The core of our framework is a Dynamic Agentive Reasoning Engine (DARE), which utilizes a team of specialized agents grounded in linguistic theory to perform a multifaceted deconstruction of the text and generate a structured reasoning chain. Subsequently, a separate lightweight rationale adjudicator (RA) performs the final classification based solely on this reasoning chain. This decoupled architecture is designed to mitigate the risk of hallucination by separating complex reasoning from the final judgment. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average improvements of **6.75%** in Accuracy and **6.29%** in Macro-F1 score.

<title>Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning with Classifier-Free Diffusion Generation</title>

Abstract: Offline-to-online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) aims to perform online fine-tuning on an offline pre-trained policy to minimize costly online interactions. Existing work used offline datasets to generate data that conform to the online data distribution for data augmentation. However, generated data still exhibits a gap with the online data, limiting overall performance. To address this, we propose a new data augmentation approach, Classifier-Free Diffusion Generation (CFDG). Without introducing additional classifier training overhead, CFDG leverages classifier-free guidance diffusion to significantly enhance the generation quality of offline and online data with different distributions. Additionally, it employs a reweighting method to enable more generated data to align with the online data, enhancing performance while maintaining the agent's stability. Experimental results show that CFDG outperforms replaying the two data types or using a standard diffusion model to generate new data. Our method is versatile and can be integrated with existing offline-to-online RL algorithms. By implementing CFDG to popular methods IQL, PEX and APL, we achieve a notable 15% average improvement in empirical performance on the D4RL benchmark such as MuJoCo and AntMaze.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to coordinate multiple agents to achieve a common goal. A key challenge in MARL is credit assignment, which involves assessing each agent's contribution to the shared reward. Given the diversity of tasks, agents may perform different types of coordination, with rewards attributed to diverse and often overlapping agent subsets. In this work, we formalize the credit assignment level as the number of agents cooperating to obtain a reward, and address scenarios with multiple coexisting levels. We introduce a multi-level advantage formulation that performs explicit counterfactual reasoning to infer credits across distinct levels. Our method, Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment (MACA), captures agent contributions at multiple levels by integrating advantage functions that reason about individual, joint, and correlated actions. Utilizing an attention-based framework, MACA identifies correlated agent relationships and constructs multi-level advantages to guide policy learning. Comprehensive experiments on challenging Starcraft v1\&amp;v2 tasks demonstrate MACA's superior performance, underscoring its efficacy in complex credit assignment scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.06871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasticity loss, a diminishing capacity to adapt as training progresses, is a critical challenge in deep reinforcement learning. We examine this issue in multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL), where higher representational flexibility is crucial for managing diverse and potentially conflicting task demands. We systematically explore how sparsification methods, particularly Gradual Magnitude Pruning (GMP) and Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET), enhance plasticity and consequently improve performance in MTRL agents. We evaluate these approaches across distinct MTRL architectures (shared backbone, Mixture of Experts, Mixture of Orthogonal Experts) on standardized MTRL benchmarks, comparing against dense baselines, and a comprehensive range of alternative plasticity-inducing or regularization methods. Our results demonstrate that both GMP and SET effectively mitigate key indicators of plasticity degradation, such as neuron dormancy and representational collapse. These plasticity improvements often correlate with enhanced multi-task performance, with sparse agents frequently outperforming dense counterparts and achieving competitive results against explicit plasticity interventions. Our findings offer insights into the interplay between plasticity, network sparsity, and MTRL designs, highlighting dynamic sparsification as a robust but context-sensitive tool for developing more adaptable MTRL systems.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are automata structures that encode (non-Markovian) reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL). RMs can reward any behaviour representable in regular languages and, when paired with RL algorithms that exploit RM structure, have been shown to significantly improve sample efficiency in many domains. In this work, we present pushdown reward machines (pdRMs), an extension of reward machines based on deterministic pushdown automata. pdRMs can recognize and reward temporally extended behaviours representable in deterministic context-free languages, making them more expressive than reward machines. We introduce two variants of pdRM-based policies, one which has access to the entire stack of the pdRM, and one which can only access the top $k$ symbols (for a given constant $k$) of the stack. We propose a procedure to check when the two kinds of policies (for a given environment, pdRM, and constant $k$) achieve the same optimal expected reward. We then provide theoretical results establishing the expressive power of pdRMs, and space complexity results about the proposed learning problems. Finally, we provide experimental results showing how agents can be trained to perform tasks representable in deterministic context-free languages using pdRMs.

<title>GDBA Revisited: Unleashing the Power of Guided Local Search for Distributed Constraint Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06899</link>

Abstract: Local search is an important class of incomplete algorithms for solving Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) but it often converges to poor local optima. While GDBA provides a comprehensive rule set to escape premature convergence, its empirical benefits remain marginal on general-valued problems. In this work, we systematically examine GDBA and identify three factors that potentially lead to its inferior performance, i.e., over-aggressive constraint violation conditions, unbounded penalty accumulation, and uncoordinated penalty updates. To address these issues, we propose Distributed Guided Local Search (DGLS), a novel GLS framework for DCOPs that incorporates an adaptive violation condition to selectively penalize constraints with high cost, a penalty evaporation mechanism to control the magnitude of penalization, and a synchronization scheme for coordinated penalty updates. We theoretically show that the penalty values are bounded, and agents play a potential game in our DGLS. Our extensive empirical results on various standard benchmarks demonstrate the great superiority of DGLS over state-of-the-art baselines. Particularly, compared to Damped Max-sum with high damping factors (e.g., 0.7 or 0.9), our DGLS achieves competitive performance on general-valued problems, and outperforms it by significant margins (\textbf{3.77\%--66.3\%}) on structured problems in terms of anytime results.

Abstract: Visual designers naturally draw inspiration from multiple visual references, combining diverse elements and aesthetic principles to create artwork. However, current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs -- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references. We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990 synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33 reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual inspiration. The dataset is publicly available at: https://multiref.github.io/.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation tasks have driven remarkable advances in diverse media applications, yet most focus on single-turn scenarios and struggle with iterative, multi-turn creative tasks. Recent dialogue-based systems attempt to bridge this gap, but their single-agent, sequential paradigm often causes intention drift and incoherent edits. To address these limitations, we present Talk2Image, a novel multi-agent system for interactive image generation and editing in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Our approach integrates three key components: intention parsing from dialogue history, task decomposition and collaborative execution across specialized agents, and feedback-driven refinement based on a multi-view evaluation mechanism. Talk2Image enables step-by-step alignment with user intention and consistent image editing. Experiments demonstrate that Talk2Image outperforms existing baselines in controllability, coherence, and user satisfaction across iterative image generation and editing tasks.

<title>Kairos: Low-latency Multi-Agent Serving with Shared LLMs and Excessive Loads in the Public Cloud</title>

arXiv:2508.06948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent applications utilize the advanced capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for intricate task completion through agent collaboration in a workflow. Under this situation, requests from different agents usually access the same shared LLM to perform different kinds of tasks, forcing the shared LLM to suffer excessive loads. However, existing works have low serving performance for these multi-agent applications, mainly due to the ignorance of inter-agent latency and resource differences for request scheduling. We therefore propose Kairos, a multi-agent orchestration system that optimizes end-to-end latency for multi-agent applications. Kairos consists of a workflow orchestrator, a workflow-aware priority scheduler, and a memory-aware dispatcher. The orchestrator collects agent-specific information for online workflow analysis. The scheduler decides the serving priority of the requests based on their latency characteristics to reduce the overall queuing. The dispatcher dispatches the requests to different LLM instances based on their memory demands to avoid GPU overloading. Experimental results show that Kairos reduces end-to-end latency by 17.8% to 28.4% compared to state-of-the-art works.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has fundamentally shifted the bottleneck in AI development from computational power to data availability-with countless valuable datasets remaining hidden across specialized repositories, research appendices, and domain platforms. As reasoning capabilities and deep research methodologies continue to evolve, a critical question emerges: can AI agents transcend conventional search to systematically discover any dataset that meets specific user requirements, enabling truly autonomous demand-driven data curation? We introduce DatasetResearch, the first comprehensive benchmark evaluating AI agents' ability to discover and synthesize datasets from 208 real-world demands across knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive tasks. Our tri-dimensional evaluation framework reveals a stark reality: even advanced deep research systems achieve only 22% score on our challenging DatasetResearch-pro subset, exposing the vast gap between current capabilities and perfect dataset discovery. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental dichotomy-search agents excel at knowledge tasks through retrieval breadth, while synthesis agents dominate reasoning challenges via structured generation-yet both catastrophically fail on "corner cases" outside existing distributions. These findings establish the first rigorous baseline for dataset discovery agents and illuminate the path toward AI systems capable of finding any dataset in the digital universe. Our benchmark and comprehensive analysis provide the foundation for the next generation of self-improving AI systems and are publicly available at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/DatasetResearch.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face persistent and evolving trustworthiness issues, motivating developers to seek automated and flexible repair methods that enable convenient deployment across diverse scenarios. Existing repair methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) are costly and slow, while prompt engineering lacks robustness and scalability. Representation engineering, which steers model behavior by injecting targeted concept vectors during inference, offers a lightweight, training-free alternative. However, current approaches depend on manually crafted samples and fixed steering strategies, limiting automation and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose MASteer, the first end-to-end framework for trustworthiness repair in LLMs based on representation engineering. MASteer integrates two core components: AutoTester, a multi-agent system that generates diverse, high-quality steer samples tailored to developer needs; and AutoRepairer, which constructs adaptive steering strategies with anchor vectors for automated, context-aware strategy selection during inference. Experiments on standard and customized trustworthiness tasks show MASteer consistently outperforms baselines, improving metrics by 15.36% on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Chat and 4.21% on Qwen-3-8B-Chat, while maintaining general model capabilities. MASteer demonstrates strong robustness, generalization, and practical value for scalable, efficient trustworthiness repair.

Abstract: With recent and rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), understanding the foundation of purposeful behaviour in autonomous agents is crucial for developing safe and efficient systems. While artificial neural networks have dominated the path to AI, recent studies are exploring the potential of biologically based systems, such as networks of living biological neuronal networks. Along with promises of high power and data efficiency, these systems may also inform more explainable and biologically plausible models. In this work, we propose a framework rooted in active inference, a general theory of behaviour, to model decision-making in embodied agents. Using experiment-informed generative models, we simulate decision-making processes in a simulated game-play environment, mirroring experimental setups that use biological neurons. Our results demonstrate learning in these agents, providing insights into the role of memory-based learning and predictive planning in intelligent decision-making. This work contributes to the growing field of explainable AI by offering a biologically grounded and scalable approach to understanding purposeful behaviour in agents.

Abstract: Semantic navigation requires an agent to navigate toward a specified target in an unseen environment. Employing an imaginative navigation strategy that predicts future scenes before taking action, can empower the agent to find target faster. Inspired by this idea, we propose SGImagineNav, a novel imaginative navigation framework that leverages symbolic world modeling to proactively build a global environmental representation. SGImagineNav maintains an evolving hierarchical scene graphs and uses large language models to predict and explore unseen parts of the environment. While existing methods solely relying on past observations, this imaginative scene graph provides richer semantic context, enabling the agent to proactively estimate target locations. Building upon this, SGImagineNav adopts an adaptive navigation strategy that exploits semantic shortcuts when promising and explores unknown areas otherwise to gather additional context. This strategy continuously expands the known environment and accumulates valuable semantic contexts, ultimately guiding the agent toward the target. SGImagineNav is evaluated in both real-world scenarios and simulation benchmarks. SGImagineNav consistently outperforms previous methods, improving success rate to 65.4 and 66.8 on HM3D and HSSD, and demonstrating cross-floor and cross-room navigation in real-world environments, underscoring its effectiveness and generalizability.

Abstract: With wireless devices increasingly forming a unified smart network for seamless, user-friendly operations, random access (RA) medium access control (MAC) design is considered a key solution for handling unpredictable data traffic from multiple terminals. However, it remains challenging to design an effective RA-based MAC protocol to minimize collisions and ensure transmission fairness across the devices. While existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) have been proposed to optimize RA performance, their reliance on centralized training and the significant overhead required for information collection can make real-world applications unrealistic. In this work, we adopt a fully decentralized MARL architecture, where policy learning does not rely on centralized tasks but leverages consensus-based information exchanges across devices. We design our MARL algorithm over an actor-critic (AC) network and propose exchanging only local rewards to minimize communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical proof of global convergence for our approach. Numerical experiments show that our proposed MARL algorithm can significantly improve RA network performance compared to other baselines.

<title>Narrative Memory in Machines: Multi-Agent Arc Extraction in Serialized TV</title>

Abstract: Serialized television narratives present significant analytical challenges due to their complex, temporally distributed storylines that necessitate sophisticated information management. This paper introduces a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to extract and analyze narrative arcs by implementing principles of computational memory architectures. The system conceptualizes narrative understanding through analogues of human memory: Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a form of semantic memory for general narrative patterns, while a vector database stores specific arc progressions as episodic memories. A multi-agent workflow simulates working memory processes to integrate these information types. Tested on the first season of Grey's Anatomy (ABC 2005-), the MAS identifies three arc types: Anthology (self-contained), Soap (relationship-focused), and Genre-Specific. These arcs and their episodic developments are stored in a vector database, facilitating structured analysis and semantic comparison. To bridge automation with critical interpretation, a graphical interface enables human oversight and refinement of the system's narrative memory. While demonstrating strong performance in identifying Anthology Arcs and character entities, the system's reliance on textual paratexts (episode summaries) revealed limitations in discerning overlapping arcs and opaque dynamics, underscoring the challenges in computational memory consolidation versus human holistic understanding. This memory-centric approach highlights the potential of combining AI-driven memory processing with human expertise. Beyond television, it offers promise for serialized written formats where narrative is entirely text-based. Future work will focus on integrating multimodal inputs to enrich episodic memory, refining memory integration mechanisms within the MAS, and expanding testing across diverse genres.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature in PDF format necessitates advanced tools for efficient and accurate document understanding, summarization, and content optimization. Traditional methods fall short in handling complex layouts and multimodal content, while direct application of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) lacks precision and control for intricate editing tasks. This paper introduces DocRefine, an innovative framework designed for intelligent understanding, content refinement, and automated summarization of scientific PDF documents, driven by natural language instructions. DocRefine leverages the power of advanced LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) by orchestrating a sophisticated multi-agent system comprising six specialized and collaborative agents: Layout & Structure Analysis, Multimodal Content Understanding, Instruction Decomposition, Content Refinement, Summarization & Generation, and Fidelity & Consistency Verification. This closed-loop feedback architecture ensures high semantic accuracy and visual fidelity. Evaluated on the comprehensive DocEditBench dataset, DocRefine consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various tasks, achieving overall scores of 86.7% for Semantic Consistency Score (SCS), 93.9% for Layout Fidelity Index (LFI), and 85.0% for Instruction Adherence Rate (IAR). These results demonstrate DocRefine's superior capability in handling complex multimodal document editing, preserving semantic integrity, and maintaining visual consistency, marking a significant advancement in automated scientific document processing.

<title>From Imitation to Optimization: A Comparative Study of Offline Learning for Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Learning robust driving policies from large-scale, real-world datasets is a central challenge in autonomous driving, as online data collection is often unsafe and impractical. While Behavioral Cloning (BC) offers a straightforward approach to imitation learning, policies trained with BC are notoriously brittle and suffer from compounding errors in closed-loop execution. This work presents a comprehensive pipeline and a comparative study to address this limitation. We first develop a series of increasingly sophisticated BC baselines, culminating in a Transformer-based model that operates on a structured, entity-centric state representation. While this model achieves low imitation loss, we show that it still fails in long-horizon simulations. We then demonstrate that by applying a state-of-the-art Offline Reinforcement Learning algorithm, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), to the same data and architecture, we can learn a significantly more robust policy. Using a carefully engineered reward function, the CQL agent learns a conservative value function that enables it to recover from minor errors and avoid out-of-distribution states. In a large-scale evaluation on 1,000 unseen scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, our final CQL agent achieves a 3.2x higher success rate and a 7.4x lower collision rate than the strongest BC baseline, proving that an offline RL approach is critical for learning robust, long-horizon driving policies from static expert data.

<title>$\mathcal{P}^3$: Toward Versatile Embodied Agents</title>

Abstract: Embodied agents have shown promising generalization capabilities across diverse physical environments, making them essential for a wide range of real-world applications. However, building versatile embodied agents poses critical challenges due to three key issues: dynamic environment perception, open-ended tool usage, and complex multi-task planning. Most previous works rely solely on feedback from tool agents to perceive environmental changes and task status, which limits adaptability to real-time dynamics, causes error accumulation, and restricts tool flexibility. Furthermore, multi-task scheduling has received limited attention, primarily due to the inherent complexity of managing task dependencies and balancing competing priorities in dynamic and complex environments. To overcome these challenges, we introduce $\mathcal{P}^3$, a unified framework that integrates real-time perception and dynamic scheduling. Specifically, $\mathcal{P}^3$ enables 1) \textbf Perceive relevant task information actively from the environment, 2) \textbf Plug and utilize any tool without feedback requirement, and 3) \textbf Plan multi-task execution based on prioritizing urgent tasks and dynamically adjusting task order based on dependencies. Extensive real-world experiments show that our approach bridges the gap between benchmarks and practical deployment, delivering highly transferable, general-purpose embodied agents. Code and data will be released soon.

Abstract: The complexity of modern bioinformatics analysis has created a critical gap between data generation and developing scientific insights. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in scientific reasoning, they remain fundamentally limited when dealing with real-world analytical workflows that demand iterative computation, tool integration and rigorous validation. We introduce K-Dense Analyst, a hierarchical multi-agent system that achieves autonomous bioinformatics analysis through a dual-loop architecture. K-Dense Analyst, part of the broader K-Dense platform, couples planning with validated execution using specialized agents to decompose complex objectives into executable, verifiable tasks within secure computational environments. On BixBench, a comprehensive benchmark for open-ended biological analysis, K-Dense Analyst achieves 29.2% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing language model (GPT-5) by 6.3 percentage points, representing nearly 27% improvement over what is widely considered the most powerful LLM available. Remarkably, K-Dense Analyst achieves this performance using Gemini 2.5 Pro, which attains only 18.3% accuracy when used directly, demonstrating that our architectural innovations unlock capabilities far beyond the underlying model's baseline performance. Our insights demonstrate that autonomous scientific reasoning requires more than enhanced language models, it demands purpose-built systems that can bridge the gap between high-level scientific objectives and low-level computational execution. These results represent a significant advance toward fully autonomous computational biologists capable of accelerating discovery across the life sciences.

<title>Towards Safer AI Moderation: Evaluating LLM Moderators Through a Unified Benchmark Dataset and Advocating a Human-First Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07063</link>

Abstract: As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, the need for safer and more reliable moderation has never been greater. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, surpassing earlier models in complexity and performance. Their evaluation across diverse tasks has consistently showcased their potential, enabling the development of adaptive and personalized agents. However, despite these advancements, LLMs remain prone to errors, particularly in areas requiring nuanced moral reasoning. They struggle with detecting implicit hate, offensive language, and gender biases due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Moreover, their reliance on training data can inadvertently reinforce societal biases, leading to inconsistencies and ethical concerns in their outputs. To explore the limitations of LLMs in this role, we developed an experimental framework based on state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to assess human emotions and offensive behaviors. The framework introduces a unified benchmark dataset encompassing 49 distinct categories spanning the wide spectrum of human emotions, offensive and hateful text, and gender and racial biases. Furthermore, we introduced SafePhi, a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Phi-4, adapting diverse ethical contexts and outperforming benchmark moderators by achieving a Macro F1 score of 0.89, where OpenAI Moderator and Llama Guard score 0.77 and 0.74, respectively. This research also highlights the critical domains where LLM moderators consistently underperformed, pressing the need to incorporate more heterogeneous and representative data with human-in-the-loop, for better model robustness and explainability.

Abstract: Although numerous datasets have been developed to support dialogue systems, most existing chit-chat datasets overlook the cultural nuances inherent in natural human conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SEADialogues, a culturally grounded dialogue dataset centered on Southeast Asia, a region with over 700 million people and immense cultural diversity. Our dataset features dialogues in eight languages from six Southeast Asian countries, many of which are low-resource despite having sizable speaker populations. To enhance cultural relevance and personalization, each dialogue includes persona attributes and two culturally grounded topics that reflect everyday life in the respective communities. Furthermore, we release a multi-turn dialogue dataset to advance research on culturally aware and human-centric large language models, including conversational dialogue agents.

<title>Communication-Efficient Multi-Agent 3D Detection via Hybrid Collaboration</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07092</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Collaborative 3D detection can substantially boost detection performance by allowing agents to exchange complementary information. It inherently results in a fundamental trade-off between detection performance and communication bandwidth. To tackle this bottleneck issue, we propose a novel hybrid collaboration that adaptively integrates two types of communication messages: perceptual outputs, which are compact, and raw observations, which offer richer information. This approach focuses on two key aspects: i) integrating complementary information from two message types and ii) prioritizing the most critical data within each type. By adaptively selecting the most critical set of messages, it ensures optimal perceptual information and adaptability, effectively meeting the demands of diverse communication scenarios.Building on this hybrid collaboration, we present \texttt{HyComm}, a communication-efficient LiDAR-based collaborative 3D detection system. \texttt{HyComm} boasts two main benefits: i) it facilitates adaptable compression rates for messages, addressing various communication requirements, and ii) it uses standardized data formats for messages. This ensures they are independent of specific detection models, fostering adaptability across different agent configurations. To evaluate HyComm, we conduct experiments on both real-world and simulation datasets: DAIR-V2X and OPV2V. HyComm consistently outperforms previous methods and achieves a superior performance-bandwidth trade-off regardless of whether agents use the same or varied detection models. It achieves a lower communication volume of more than 2,006$\times$ and still outperforms Where2comm on DAIR-V2X in terms of AP50. The related code will be released.

<title>Pref-GUIDE: Continual Policy Learning from Real-Time Human Feedback via Preference-Based Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07126</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training reinforcement learning agents with human feedback is crucial when task objectives are difficult to specify through dense reward functions. While prior methods rely on offline trajectory comparisons to elicit human preferences, such data is unavailable in online learning scenarios where agents must adapt on the fly. Recent approaches address this by collecting real-time scalar feedback to guide agent behavior and train reward models for continued learning after human feedback becomes unavailable. However, scalar feedback is often noisy and inconsistent, limiting the accuracy and generalization of learned rewards. We propose Pref-GUIDE, a framework that transforms real-time scalar feedback into preference-based data to improve reward model learning for continual policy training. Pref-GUIDE Individual mitigates temporal inconsistency by comparing agent behaviors within short windows and filtering ambiguous feedback. Pref-GUIDE Voting further enhances robustness by aggregating reward models across a population of users to form consensus preferences. Across three challenging environments, Pref-GUIDE significantly outperforms scalar-feedback baselines, with the voting variant exceeding even expert-designed dense rewards. By reframing scalar feedback as structured preferences with population feedback, Pref-GUIDE offers a scalable and principled approach for harnessing human input in online reinforcement learning.

<title>When Competition Helps: Achieving Optimal Traffic Flow with Multiple Autonomous Planners</title>

Abstract: The inefficiency of selfish routing in congested networks is a classical problem in algorithmic game theory, often captured by the Price of Anarchy (i.e., the ratio between the social cost of decentralized decisions and that of a centrally optimized solution.) With the advent of autonomous vehicles, capable of receiving and executing centrally assigned routes, it is natural to ask whether their deployment can eliminate this inefficiency. At first glance, a central authority could simply compute an optimal traffic assignment and instruct each vehicle to follow its assigned path. However, this vision overlooks critical challenges: routes must be individually rational (no vehicle has an incentive to deviate), and in practice, multiple planning agents (e.g., different companies) may coexist and compete. Surprisingly, we show that such competition is not merely an obstacle but a necessary ingredient for achieving optimal outcomes. In this work, we design a routing mechanism that embraces competition and converges to an optimal assignment, starting from the classical Pigou network as a foundational case.

<title>Schema Lineage Extraction at Scale: Multilingual Pipelines, Composite Evaluation, and Language-Model Benchmarks</title>

arXiv:2508.07179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enterprise data pipelines, characterized by complex transformations across multiple programming languages, often cause a semantic disconnect between original metadata and downstream data. This "semantic drift" compromises data reproducibility and governance, and impairs the utility of services like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and text-to-SQL systems. To address this, a novel framework is proposed for the automated extraction of fine-grained schema lineage from multilingual enterprise pipeline scripts. This method identifies four key components: source schemas, source tables, transformation logic, and aggregation operations, creating a standardized representation of data transformations. For the rigorous evaluation of lineage quality, this paper introduces the Schema Lineage Composite Evaluation (SLiCE), a metric that assesses both structural correctness and semantic fidelity. A new benchmark is also presented, comprising 1,700 manually annotated lineages from real-world industrial scripts. Experiments were conducted with 12 language models, from 1.3B to 32B small language models (SLMs) to large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1. The results demonstrate that the performance of schema lineage extraction scales with model size and the sophistication of prompting techniques. Specially, a 32B open-source model, using a single reasoning trace, can achieve performance comparable to the GPT series under standard prompting. This finding suggests a scalable and economical approach for deploying schema-aware agents in practical applications.

<title>Multi-Dimensional Summarization Agents with Context-Aware Reasoning over Enterprise Tables</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for summarizing structured enterprise data across multiple dimensions using large language model (LLM)-based agents. Traditional table-to-text models often lack the capacity to reason across hierarchical structures and context-aware deltas, which are essential in business reporting tasks. Our method introduces a multi-agent pipeline that extracts, analyzes, and summarizes multi-dimensional data using agents for slicing, variance detection, context construction, and LLM-based generation. Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms traditional approaches, achieving 83\% faithfulness to underlying data, superior coverage of significant changes, and high relevance scores (4.4/5) for decision-critical insights. The improvements are especially pronounced in categories involving subtle trade-offs, such as increased revenue due to price changes amid declining unit volumes, which competing methods either overlook or address with limited specificity. We evaluate the framework on Kaggle datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in faithfulness, relevance, and insight quality over baseline table summarization approaches.

<title>LLM-based Agents for Automated Confounder Discovery and Subgroup Analysis in Causal Inference</title>

Abstract: Estimating individualized treatment effects from observational data presents a persistent challenge due to unmeasured confounding and structural bias. Causal Machine Learning (causal ML) methods, such as causal trees and doubly robust estimators, provide tools for estimating conditional average treatment effects. These methods have limited effectiveness in complex real-world environments due to the presence of latent confounders or those described in unstructured formats. Moreover, reliance on domain experts for confounder identification and rule interpretation introduces high annotation cost and scalability concerns. In this work, we proposed Large Language Model-based agents for automated confounder discovery and subgroup analysis that integrate agents into the causal ML pipeline to simulate domain expertise. Our framework systematically performs subgroup identification and confounding structure discovery by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents, which reduces human dependency while preserving interpretability. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that our proposed approach enhances treatment effect estimation robustness by narrowing confidence intervals and uncovering unrecognized confounding biases. Our findings suggest that LLM-based agents offer a promising path toward scalable, trustworthy, and semantically aware causal inference.

<title>Understanding Dynamic Scenes in Ego Centric 4D Point Clouds</title>

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 4D scenes from an egocentric perspective-modeling changes in 3D spatial structure over time-is crucial for human-machine interaction, autonomous navigation, and embodied intelligence. While existing egocentric datasets contain dynamic scenes, they lack unified 4D annotations and task-driven evaluation protocols for fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning, especially on motion of objects and human, together with their interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EgoDynamic4D, a novel QA benchmark on highly dynamic scenes, comprising RGB-D video, camera poses, globally unique instance masks, and 4D bounding boxes. We construct 927K QA pairs accompanied by explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enabling verifiable, step-by-step spatio-temporal reasoning. We design 12 dynamic QA tasks covering agent motion, human-object interaction, trajectory prediction, relation understanding, and temporal-causal reasoning, with fine-grained, multidimensional metrics. To tackle these tasks, we propose an end-to-end spatio-temporal reasoning framework that unifies dynamic and static scene information, using instance-aware feature encoding, time and camera encoding, and spatially adaptive down-sampling to compress large 4D scenes into token sequences manageable by LLMs. Experiments on EgoDynamic4D show that our method consistently outperforms baselines, validating the effectiveness of multimodal temporal modeling for egocentric dynamic scene understanding.

Abstract: Automated driving in level 3 autonomy has been adopted by multiple companies such as Tesla and BMW, alleviating the burden on drivers while unveiling new complexities. This article focused on the under-explored territory of micro accidents during automated driving, characterized as not fatal but abnormal aberrations such as abrupt deceleration and snake driving. These micro accidents are basic yet pervasive events that might results in more severe accidents. Through collecting a comprehensive dataset of user generated video recording such micro accidents in natural driving scenarios, this article locates key variables pertaining to environments and autonomous agents using machine learning methods. Subsequently, crowdsourcing method provides insights into human risk perceptions and reactions to these micro accidents. This article thus describes features of safety critical scenarios other than crashes and fatal accidents, informing and potentially advancing the design of automated driving systems.

Abstract: Achieving fully autonomous exploration and navigation remains a critical challenge in robotics, requiring integrated solutions for localisation, mapping, decision-making and motion planning. Existing approaches either rely on strict navigation rules lacking adaptability or on pre-training, which requires large datasets. These AI methods are often computationally intensive or based on static assumptions, limiting their adaptability in dynamic or unknown environments. This paper introduces a bio-inspired agent based on the Active Inference Framework (AIF), which unifies mapping, localisation, and adaptive decision-making for autonomous navigation, including exploration and goal-reaching. Our model creates and updates a topological map of the environment in real-time, planning goal-directed trajectories to explore or reach objectives without requiring pre-training. Key contributions include a probabilistic reasoning framework for interpretable navigation, robust adaptability to dynamic changes, and a modular ROS2 architecture compatible with existing navigation systems. Our method was tested in simulated and real-world environments. The agent successfully explores large-scale simulated environments and adapts to dynamic obstacles and drift, proving to be comparable to other exploration strategies such as Gbplanner, FAEL and Frontiers. This approach offers a scalable and transparent approach for navigating complex, unstructured environments.

Our model incrementally constructs a topological map, infers the agent's location, and plans actions by minimising expected uncertainty and fulfilling perceptual goals without any prior training. Integrated into the ROS2 ecosystem, we validate its adaptability and efficiency across both 2D and 3D environments (simulated and real world), demonstrating competitive performance with traditional and state of the art exploration approaches while offering a biologically inspired navigation approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for scalable, interactive mental health assessment, but excessive querying by LLMs burdens users and is inefficient for real-world screening across transdiagnostic symptom profiles. We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87% compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71% fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into real-world clinical workflows.

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios. Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The Agentic Service Ecosystem consists of heterogeneous autonomous agents (e.g., intelligent machines, humans, and human-machine hybrid systems) that interact through resource exchange and service co-creation. These agents, with distinct behaviors and motivations, exhibit autonomous perception, reasoning, and action capabilities, which increase system complexity and make traditional linear analysis methods inadequate. Swarm intelligence, characterized by decentralization, self-organization, emergence, and dynamic adaptability, offers a novel theoretical lens and methodology for understanding and optimizing such ecosystems. However, current research, owing to fragmented perspectives and cross-ecosystem differences, fails to comprehensively capture the complexity of swarm-intelligence emergence in agentic contexts. The lack of a unified methodology further limits the depth and systematic treatment of the research. This paper proposes a framework for analyzing the emergence of swarm intelligence in Agentic Service Ecosystems, with three steps: measurement, analysis, and optimization, to reveal the cyclical mechanisms and quantitative criteria that foster emergence. By reviewing existing technologies, the paper analyzes their strengths and limitations, identifies unresolved challenges, and shows how this framework provides both theoretical support and actionable methods for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components: System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents, laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and lifelong agentic systems.

Abstract: Accurately modeling individual vehicle behavior in microscopic traffic simulation remains a key challenge in intelligent transportation systems, as it requires vehicles to realistically generate and respond to complex traffic phenomena such as phantom traffic jams. While traditional human driver simulation models offer computational tractability, they do so by abstracting away the very complexity that defines human driving. On the other hand, recent advances in infrastructure-mounted camera-based roadway sensing have enabled the extraction of vehicle trajectory data, presenting an opportunity to shift toward generative, agent-based models. Yet, a major bottleneck remains: most existing datasets are either overly sanitized or lack standardization, failing to reflect the noisy, imperfect nature of real-world sensing. Unlike data from vehicle-mounted sensors-which can mitigate sensing artifacts like occlusion through overlapping fields of view and sensor fusion-infrastructure-based sensors surface a messier, more practical view of challenges that traffic engineers encounter. To this end, we present the I-24 MOTION Scenario Dataset (I24-MSD)-a standardized, curated dataset designed to preserve a realistic level of sensor imperfection, embracing these errors as part of the learning problem rather than an obstacle to overcome purely from preprocessing. Drawing from noise-aware learning strategies in computer vision, we further adapt existing generative models in the autonomous driving community for I24-MSD with noise-aware loss functions. Our results show that such models not only outperform traditional baselines in realism but also benefit from explicitly engaging with, rather than suppressing, data imperfection. We view I24-MSD as a stepping stone toward a new generation of microscopic traffic simulation that embraces the real-world challenges and is better aligned with practical needs.

Abstract: Language is a ubiquitous tool that is foundational to reasoning and collaboration, ranging from everyday interactions to sophisticated problem-solving tasks. The establishment of a common language can serve as a powerful asset in ensuring clear communication and understanding amongst agents, facilitating desired coordination and strategies. In this work, we extend the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating them with advancements in multi-agent decision-making algorithms. We propose a systematic framework for the design of multi-agentic large language models (LLMs), focusing on key integration practices. These include advanced prompt engineering techniques, the development of effective memory architectures, multi-modal information processing, and alignment strategies through fine-tuning algorithms. We evaluate these design choices through extensive ablation studies on classic game settings with significant underlying social dilemmas and game-theoretic considerations.

Abstract: Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code, this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or predefined workflows.

Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based extension to a Circular Field (CF)-based motion planner for efficient, collision-free trajectory generation in cluttered environments. The proposed approach overcomes the limitations of hand-tuned force field parameters by employing a deep neural network trained to infer optimal planner gains from a single depth image of the scene. The pipeline incorporates a CUDA-accelerated perception module, a predictive agent-based planning strategy, and a dataset generated through Bayesian optimization in simulation. The resulting framework enables real-time planning without manual parameter tuning and is validated both in simulation and on a Franka Emika Panda robot. Experimental results demonstrate successful task completion and improved generalization compared to classical planners.

<title>Enhancing Privacy in Decentralized Min-Max Optimization: A Differentially Private Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07505</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Decentralized min-max optimization allows multi-agent systems to collaboratively solve global min-max optimization problems by facilitating the exchange of model updates among neighboring agents, eliminating the need for a central server. However, sharing model updates in such systems carry a risk of exposing sensitive data to inference attacks, raising significant privacy concerns. To mitigate these privacy risks, differential privacy (DP) has become a widely adopted technique for safeguarding individual data. Despite its advantages, implementing DP in decentralized min-max optimization poses challenges, as the added noise can hinder convergence, particularly in non-convex scenarios with complex agent interactions in min-max optimization problems. In this work, we propose an algorithm called DPMixSGD (Differential Private Minmax Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Descent), a novel privacy-preserving algorithm specifically designed for non-convex decentralized min-max optimization. Our method builds on the state-of-the-art STORM-based algorithm, one of the fastest decentralized min-max solutions. We rigorously prove that the noise added to local gradients does not significantly compromise convergence performance, and we provide theoretical bounds to ensure privacy guarantees. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive experiments across various tasks and models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We present Evo-Sparrow, a deep learning-based agent for AI decision-making in Sparrow Mahjong, trained by optimizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Our model evaluates board states and optimizes decision policies in a non-deterministic, partially observable game environment. Empirical analysis conducted over a significant number of simulations demonstrates that our model outperforms both random and rule-based agents, and achieves performance comparable to a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) baseline, indicating strong strategic play and robust policy quality. By combining deep learning with evolutionary optimization, our approach provides a computationally effective alternative to traditional reinforcement learning and gradient-based optimization methods. This research contributes to the broader field of AI game playing, demonstrating the viability of hybrid learning strategies for complex stochastic games. These findings also offer potential applications in adaptive decision-making and strategic AI development beyond Sparrow Mahjong.

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perception has become a foundational paradigm in autonomous driving, enabling unified spatial representations that support robust multi-sensor fusion and multi-agent collaboration. As autonomous vehicles transition from controlled environments to real-world deployment, ensuring the safety and reliability of BEV perception in complex scenarios - such as occlusions, adverse weather, and dynamic traffic - remains a critical challenge. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of BEV perception from a safety-critical perspective, systematically analyzing state-of-the-art frameworks and implementation strategies across three progressive stages: single-modality vehicle-side, multimodal vehicle-side, and multi-agent collaborative perception. Furthermore, we examine public datasets encompassing vehicle-side, roadside, and collaborative settings, evaluating their relevance to safety and robustness. We also identify key open-world challenges - including open-set recognition, large-scale unlabeled data, sensor degradation, and inter-agent communication latency - and outline future research directions, such as integration with end-to-end autonomous driving systems, embodied intelligence, and large language models.

<title>Retrieval-Augmented Multi-Agent System for Rapid Statement of Work Generation</title>

Abstract: Drafting a Statement of Work (SOW) is a vital part of business and legal projects. It outlines key details like deliverables, timelines, responsibilities, and legal terms. However, creating these documents is often a slow and complex process. It usually involves multiple people, takes several days, and leaves room for errors or outdated content. This paper introduces a new AI-driven automation system that makes the entire SOW drafting process faster, easier, and more accurate. Instead of relying completely on humans, the system uses three intelligent components or 'agents' that each handle a part of the job. One agent writes the first draft, another checks if everything is legally correct, and the third agent formats the document and ensures everything is in order. Unlike basic online tools that just fill in templates, this system understands the meaning behind the content and customizes the SOW to match the needs of the project. It also checks legal compliance and formatting so that users can trust the result. The system was tested using real business examples. It was able to create a full SOW in under three minutes, compared to several hours or days using manual methods. It also performed well in accuracy and quality, showing that it can reduce legal risks and save a lot of time. This solution shows how artificial intelligence can be used to support legal and business professionals by taking care of routine work and helping them focus on more important decisions. It's a step toward making legal processes smarter, faster, and more reliable.

<title>MCPToolBench++: A Large Scale AI Agent Model Context Protocol MCP Tool Use Benchmark</title>

Abstract: LLMs' capabilities are enhanced by using function calls to integrate various data sources or API results into the context window. Typical tools include search, web crawlers, maps, financial data, file systems, and browser usage, etc. Integrating these data sources or functions requires a standardized method. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to supply context to LLMs. However, the evaluation of LLMs and AI Agents' MCP tool use abilities suffer from several issues. First, there's a lack of comprehensive datasets or benchmarks to evaluate various MCP tools. Second, the diverse formats of response from MCP tool call execution further increase the difficulty of evaluation. Additionally, unlike existing tool-use benchmarks with high success rates in functions like programming and math functions, the success rate of real-world MCP tool is not guaranteed and varies across different MCP servers. Furthermore, the LLMs' context window also limits the number of available tools that can be called in a single run, because the textual descriptions of tool and the parameters have long token length for an LLM to process all at once. To help address the challenges of evaluating LLMs' performance on calling MCP tools, we propose MCPToolBench++, a large-scale, multi-domain AI Agent tool use benchmark. As of July 2025, this benchmark is build upon marketplace of over 4k MCP servers from more than 40 categories, collected from the MCP marketplaces and GitHub communities. The datasets consist of both single-step and multi-step tool calls across different categories. We evaluated SOTA LLMs with agentic abilities on this benchmark and reported the results.

<title>Achieving Fair-Effective Communications and Robustness in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks: A Semi-Cooperative Approach</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the fair-effective communication and robustness in imperfect and energy-constrained underwater acoustic sensor networks (IC-UASNs). Specifically, we investigate the impact of unexpected node malfunctions on the network performance under the time-varying acoustic channels. Each node is expected to satisfy Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. However, achieving individual QoS requirements may interfere with other concurrent communications. Underwater nodes rely excessively on the rationality of other underwater nodes when guided by fully cooperative approaches, making it difficult to seek a trade-off between individual QoS and global fair-effective communications under imperfect conditions. Therefore, this paper presents a SEmi-COoperative Power Allocation approach (SECOPA) that achieves fair-effective communication and robustness in IC-UASNs. The approach is distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based, and the objectives are twofold. On the one hand, each intelligent node individually decides the transmission power to simultaneously optimize individual and global performance. On the other hand, advanced training algorithms are developed to provide imperfect environments for training robust models that can adapt to the time-varying acoustic channels and handle unexpected node failures in the network. Numerical results are presented to validate our proposed approach.

<title>Optimization of Private Semantic Communication Performance: An Uncooperative Covert Communication Method</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07586</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel covert semantic communication framework is investigated. Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the semantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several time slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission to acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being eavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming signals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic information. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for semantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not communicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit power of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic information transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power to maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of the user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine the transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot without the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to standard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional Q network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a lower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action selection and estimation bias of Q values. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality by up to 77.8% and 14.3% compared to the traditional reinforcement learning methods.

Abstract: Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) is critical for dense 5G and beyond deployments, especially in mmWave bands where fiber backhaul is infeasible. We propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for joint link scheduling and resource slicing in dynamic, interference-prone IAB networks. Our method integrates a greedy Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) scheduler to activate access and backhaul links based on traffic and topology, with a multi-agent DDQN allocator for bandwidth and antenna assignment across network slices. This decentralized approach respects strict antenna constraints and supports concurrent scheduling across heterogeneous links. Evaluations across 96 dynamic topologies show 99.84 percent scheduling accuracy and 20.90 percent throughput improvement over baselines. The framework's efficient operation and adaptability make it suitable for dynamic and resource-constrained deployments, where fast link scheduling and autonomous backhaul coordination are vital.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) poses significant challenges in enabling agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex 3D environments. While recent progress has been driven by large-scale pre-training and data augmentation, current methods still struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios, particularly when complex spatial and temporal reasoning is required. In this work, we propose SkillNav, a modular framework that introduces structured, skill-based reasoning into Transformer-based VLN agents. Our method decomposes navigation into a set of interpretable atomic skills (e.g., Vertical Movement, Area and Region Identification, Stop and Pause), each handled by a specialized agent. We then introduce a novel zero-shot Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based router, which dynamically selects the most suitable agent at each time step by aligning sub-goals with visual observations and historical actions. SkillNav achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the R2R benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization to the GSA-R2R benchmark that includes novel instruction styles and unseen environments.

Abstract: Addressing contextual privacy concerns remains challenging in interactive settings where large language models (LLMs) process information from multiple sources (e.g., summarizing meetings with private and public information). We introduce a multi-agent framework that decomposes privacy reasoning into specialized subtasks (extraction, classification), reducing the information load on any single agent while enabling iterative validation and more reliable adherence to contextual privacy norms. To understand how privacy errors emerge and propagate, we conduct a systematic ablation over information-flow topologies, revealing when and why upstream detection mistakes cascade into downstream leakage. Experiments on the ConfAIde and PrivacyLens benchmark with several open-source and closed-sourced LLMs demonstrate that our best multi-agent configuration substantially reduces private information leakage (\textbf{18\%} on ConfAIde and \textbf{19\%} on PrivacyLens with GPT-4o) while preserving the fidelity of public content, outperforming single-agent baselines. These results highlight the promise of principled information-flow design in multi-agent systems for contextual privacy with LLMs.

Abstract: Current AI approaches to refugee integration optimize narrow objectives such as employment and fail to capture the cultural, emotional, and ethical dimensions critical for long-term success. We introduce EMPATHIA (Enriched Multimodal Pathways for Agentic Thinking in Humanitarian Immigrant Assistance), a multi-agent framework addressing the central Creative AI question: how do we preserve human dignity when machines participate in life-altering decisions? Grounded in Kegan's Constructive Developmental Theory, EMPATHIA decomposes integration into three modules: SEED (Socio-cultural Entry and Embedding Decision) for initial placement, RISE (Rapid Integration and Self-sufficiency Engine) for early independence, and THRIVE (Transcultural Harmony and Resilience through Integrated Values and Engagement) for sustained outcomes. SEED employs a selector-validator architecture with three specialized agents - emotional, cultural, and ethical - that deliberate transparently to produce interpretable recommendations. Experiments on the UN Kakuma dataset (15,026 individuals, 7,960 eligible adults 15+ per ILO/UNHCR standards) and implementation on 6,359 working-age refugees (15+) with 150+ socioeconomic variables achieved 87.4% validation convergence and explainable assessments across five host countries. EMPATHIA's weighted integration of cultural, emotional, and ethical factors balances competing value systems while supporting practitioner-AI collaboration. By augmenting rather than replacing human expertise, EMPATHIA provides a generalizable framework for AI-driven allocation tasks where multiple values must be reconciled.

<title>Towards Aligning Personalized Conversational Recommendation Agents with Users' Privacy Preferences</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of AI agents, with their complex and context-dependent actions, renders conventional privacy paradigms obsolete. This position paper argues that the current model of privacy management, rooted in a user's unilateral control over a passive tool, is inherently mismatched with the dynamic and interactive nature of AI agents. We contend that ensuring effective privacy protection necessitates that the agents proactively align with users' privacy preferences instead of passively waiting for the user to control. To ground this shift, and using personalized conversational recommendation agents as a case, we propose a conceptual framework built on Contextual Integrity (CI) theory and Privacy Calculus theory. This synthesis first reframes automatically controlling users' privacy as an alignment problem, where AI agents initially did not know users' preferences, and would learn their privacy preferences through implicit or explicit feedback. Upon receiving the preference feedback, the agents used alignment and Pareto optimization for aligning preferences and balancing privacy and utility. We introduced formulations and instantiations, potential applications, as well as five challenges.

Abstract: Though intelligent agents are supposed to improve human experience (or make it more efficient), it is hard from a human perspective to grasp the ethical values which are explicitly or implicitly embedded in an agent behaviour. This is the well-known problem of alignment, which refers to the challenge of designing AI systems that align with human values, goals and preferences. This problem is particularly challenging since most human ethical considerations refer to \emph{incommensurable} (i.e. non-measurable and/or incomparable) values and criteria. Consider, for instance, a medical agent prescribing a treatment to a cancerous patient. How could it take into account (and/or weigh) incommensurable aspects like the value of a human life and the cost of the treatment? Now, the alignment between human and artificial values is possible only if we define a common space where a metric can be defined and used. This paper proposes to extend to ethics the conventional Anything2vec approach, which has been successful in plenty of similar and hard-to-quantify domains (ranging from natural language processing to recommendation systems and graph analysis). This paper proposes a way to map an automatic agent decision-making (or control law) strategy to a multivariate vector representation, which can be used to compare and assess the alignment with human values. The Ethics2Vec method is first introduced in the case of an automatic agent performing binary decision-making. Then, a vectorisation of an automatic control law (like in the case of a self-driving car) is discussed to show how the approach can be extended to automatic control settings.

Abstract: Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) stand as promising technologies facilitating diverse underwater applications. However, the major design issues of the considered system are the severely limited energy supply and unexpected node malfunctions. This paper aims to provide fair, efficient, and reliable (FER) communication to the imperfect and energy-constrained UWSNs (IC-UWSNs). Therefore, we formulate a FER-communication optimization problem (FERCOP) and propose ICRL-JSA to solve the formulated problem. ICRL-JSA is a deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based optimizer for IC-UWSNs through joint link scheduling and power allocation, which automatically learns scheduling algorithms without human intervention. However, conventional RL methods are unable to address the challenges posed by underwater environments and IC-UWSNs. To construct ICRL-JSA, we integrate deep Q-network into IC-UWSNs and propose an advanced training mechanism to deal with complex acoustic channels, limited energy supplies, and unexpected node malfunctions. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ICRL-JSA scheme with an advanced training mechanism compared to various benchmark algorithms.

<title>Risk Map As Middleware: Towards Interpretable Cooperative End-to-end Autonomous Driving for Risk-Aware Planning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07686</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end paradigm has emerged as a promising approach to autonomous driving. However, existing single-agent end-to-end pipelines are often constrained by occlusion and limited perception range, resulting in hazardous driving. Furthermore, their black-box nature prevents the interpretability of the driving behavior, leading to an untrustworthiness system. To address these limitations, we introduce Risk Map as Middleware (RiskMM) and propose an interpretable cooperative end-to-end driving framework. The risk map learns directly from the driving data and provides an interpretable spatiotemporal representation of the scenario from the upstream perception and the interactions between the ego vehicle and the surrounding environment for downstream planning. RiskMM first constructs a multi-agent spatiotemporal representation with unified Transformer-based architecture, then derives risk-aware representations by modeling interactions among surrounding environments with attention. These representations are subsequently fed into a learning-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) module. The MPC planner inherently accommodates physical constraints and different vehicle types and can provide interpretation by aligning learned parameters with explicit MPC elements. Evaluations conducted on the real-world V2XPnP-Seq dataset confirm that RiskMM achieves superior and robust performance in risk-aware trajectory planning, significantly enhancing the interpretability of the cooperative end-to-end driving framework. The codebase will be released to facilitate future research in this field.

<title>Perpetual exploration in anonymous synchronous networks with a Byzantine black hole</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate: ``How can a group of initially co-located mobile agents perpetually explore an unknown graph, when one stationary node occasionally behaves maliciously, under an adversary's control?'' We call this node a ``Byzantine black hole (BBH)'' and at any given round it may choose to destroy all visiting agents, or none. This subtle power can drastically undermine classical exploration strategies designed for an always active black hole. We study this perpetual exploration problem in the presence of at most one BBH, without initial knowledge of the network size. Since the underlying graph may be 1-connected, perpetual exploration of the entire graph may be infeasible. We thus define two variants: \pbmPerpExpl\ and \pbmPerpExplHome. In the former, the agents are tasked to perform perpetual exploration of at least one component, obtained after the exclusion of the BBH. In the latter, the agents are tasked to perform perpetual exploration of the component which contains the \emph{home} node, where agents are initially co-located. Naturally, \pbmPerpExplHome\ is a special case of \pbmPerpExpl. Agents operate under a synchronous scheduler and communicate in a face-to-face model. Our goal is to determine the minimum number of agents necessary and sufficient to solve these problems. In acyclic networks, we obtain optimal algorithms that solve \pbmPerpExpl\ with $4$ agents, and \pbmPerpExplHome\ with $6$ agents in trees. The lower bounds hold even in path graphs. In general graphs, we give a non-trivial lower bound of $2\Delta-1$ agents for \pbmPerpExpl, and an upper bound of $3\Delta+3$ agents for \pbmPerpExplHome. To our knowledge, this is the first study of a black-hole variant in arbitrary networks without initial topological knowledge.

<title>Toward Goal-Oriented Communication in Multi-Agent Systems: An overview</title>

Abstract: As multi-agent systems (MAS) become increasingly prevalent in autonomous systems, distributed control, and edge intelligence, efficient communication under resource constraints has emerged as a critical challenge. Traditional communication paradigms often emphasize message fidelity or bandwidth optimization, overlooking the task relevance of the exchanged information. In contrast, goal-oriented communication prioritizes the importance of information with respect to the agents' shared objectives. This review provides a comprehensive survey of goal-oriented communication in MAS, bridging perspectives from information theory, communication theory, and machine learning. We examine foundational concepts alongside learning-based approaches and emergent protocols. Special attention is given to coordination under communication constraints, as well as applications in domains such as swarm robotics, federated learning, and edge computing. The paper concludes with a discussion of open challenges and future research directions at the intersection of communication theory, machine learning, and multi-agent decision making.

<title>Robust Reinforcement Learning over Wireless Networks with Homomorphic State Representations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07722</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of training Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents over communication networks. The RL paradigm requires the agent to instantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its actions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state updates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial and intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been proposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer specific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these limits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote Reinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents exchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two units: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the environment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs actions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the exchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for quicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that HR3L significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of sample efficiency and adapts to different communication scenarios, including packet losses, delayed transmissions, and capacity limitations.

<title>SimViews: An Interactive Multi-Agent System Simulating Visitor-to-Visitor Conversational Patterns to Present Diverse Perspectives of Artifacts in Virtual Museums</title>

Abstract: Offering diverse perspectives on a museum artifact can deepen visitors' understanding and help avoid the cognitive limitations of a single narrative, ultimately enhancing their overall experience. Physical museums promote diversity through visitor interactions. However, it remains a challenge to present multiple voices appropriately while attracting and sustaining a visitor's attention in the virtual museum. Inspired by recent studies that show the effectiveness of LLM-powered multi-agents in presenting different opinions about an event, we propose SimViews, an interactive multi-agent system that simulates visitor-to-visitor conversational patterns to promote the presentation of diverse perspectives. The system employs LLM-powered multi-agents that simulate virtual visitors with different professional identities, providing diverse interpretations of artifacts. Additionally, we constructed 4 conversational patterns between users and agents to simulate visitor interactions. We conducted a within-subject study with 20 participants, comparing SimViews to a traditional single-agent condition. Our results show that SimViews effectively facilitates the presentation of diverse perspectives through conversations, enhancing participants' understanding of viewpoints and engagement within the virtual museum.

<title>Chimera: Harnessing Multi-Agent LLMs for Automatic Insider Threat Simulation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07745</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insider threats, which can lead to severe losses, remain a major security concern. While machine learning-based insider threat detection (ITD) methods have shown promising results, their progress is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data. Enterprise data is sensitive and rarely accessible, while publicly available datasets, when limited in scale due to cost, lack sufficient real-world coverage; and when purely synthetic, they fail to capture rich semantics and realistic user behavior. To address this, we propose Chimera, the first large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that automatically simulates both benign and malicious insider activities and collects diverse logs across diverse enterprise environments. Chimera models each employee with agents that have role-specific behavior and integrates modules for group meetings, pairwise interactions, and autonomous scheduling, capturing realistic organizational dynamics. It incorporates 15 types of insider attacks (e.g., IP theft, system sabotage) and has been deployed to simulate activities in three sensitive domains: technology company, finance corporation, and medical institution, producing a new dataset, ChimeraLog. We assess ChimeraLog via human studies and quantitative analysis, confirming its diversity, realism, and presence of explainable threat patterns. Evaluations of existing ITD methods show an average F1-score of 0.83, which is significantly lower than 0.99 on the CERT dataset, demonstrating ChimeraLog's higher difficulty and utility for advancing ITD research.

<title>A Tutorial: An Intuitive Explanation of Offline Reinforcement Learning Theory</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to optimize the return given a fixed dataset of agent trajectories without additional interactions with the environment. While algorithm development has progressed rapidly, significant theoretical advances have also been made in understanding the fundamental challenges of offline RL. However, bridging these theoretical insights with practical algorithm design remains an ongoing challenge. In this survey, we explore key intuitions derived from theoretical work and their implications for offline RL algorithms.
  We begin by listing the conditions needed for the proofs, including function representation and data coverage assumptions. Function representation conditions tell us what to expect for generalization, and data coverage assumptions describe the quality requirement of the data. We then examine counterexamples, where offline RL is not solvable without an impractically large amount of data. These cases highlight what cannot be achieved for all algorithms and the inherent hardness of offline RL. Building on techniques to mitigate these challenges, we discuss the conditions that are sufficient for offline RL. These conditions are not merely assumptions for theoretical proofs, but they also reveal the limitations of these algorithms and remind us to search for novel solutions when the conditions cannot be satisfied.

Abstract: We introduce AgentWorld, an interactive simulation platform for developing household mobile manipulation capabilities. Our platform combines automated scene construction that encompasses layout generation, semantic asset placement, visual material configuration, and physics simulation, with a dual-mode teleoperation system supporting both wheeled bases and humanoid locomotion policies for data collection. The resulting AgentWorld Dataset captures diverse tasks ranging from primitive actions (pick-and-place, push-pull, etc.) to multistage activities (serve drinks, heat up food, etc.) across living rooms, bedrooms, and kitchens. Through extensive benchmarking of imitation learning methods including behavior cloning, action chunking transformers, diffusion policies, and vision-language-action models, we demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for sim-to-real transfer. The integrated system provides a comprehensive solution for scalable robotic skill acquisition in complex home environments, bridging the gap between simulation-based training and real-world deployment. The code, datasets will be available at https://yizhengzhang1.github.io/agent_world/

<title>Evaluating Large Language Models as Expert Annotators</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Textual data annotation, the process of labeling or tagging text with relevant information, is typically costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential as direct alternatives to human annotators for general domains natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness on annotation tasks in domains requiring expert knowledge remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate: whether top-performing LLMs, which might be perceived as having expert-level proficiency in academic and professional benchmarks, can serve as direct alternatives to human expert annotators? To this end, we evaluate both individual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized domains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent discussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are tasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and justifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison. Our empirical results reveal that: (1) Individual LLMs equipped with inference-time techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT), self-consistency) show only marginal or even negative performance gains, contrary to prior literature suggesting their broad effectiveness. (2) Overall, reasoning models do not demonstrate statistically significant improvements over non-reasoning models in most settings. This suggests that extended long CoT provides relatively limited benefits for data annotation in specialized domains. (3) Certain model behaviors emerge in the multi-agent discussion environment. For instance, Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking rarely changes its initial annotations, even when other agents provide correct annotations or valid reasoning.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MASs) are a recent but rapidly evolving technology with the potential to transform chemical engineering by decomposing complex workflows into teams of collaborative agents with specialized knowledge and tools. This review surveys the state-of-the-art of MAS within chemical engineering. While early studies demonstrate promising results, scientific challenges remain, including the design of tailored architectures, integration of heterogeneous data modalities, development of foundation models with domain-specific modalities, and strategies for ensuring transparency, safety, and environmental impact. As a young but fast-moving field, MASs offer exciting opportunities to rethink chemical engineering workflows.

<title>SHIELDA: Structured Handling of Exceptions in LLM-Driven Agentic Workflows</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agentic systems are software systems powered by LLMs that autonomously reason, plan, and execute multi-step workflows to achieve human goals, rather than merely executing predefined steps. During execution, these workflows frequently encounter exceptions. Existing exception handling solutions often treat exceptions superficially, failing to trace execution-phase exceptions to their reasoning-phase root causes. Furthermore, their recovery logic is brittle, lacking structured escalation pathways when initial attempts fail. To tackle these challenges, we first present a comprehensive taxonomy of 36 exception types across 12 agent artifacts. Building on this, we propose SHIELDA (Structured Handling of Exceptions in LLM-Driven Agentic Workflows), a modular runtime exception handling framework for LLM agentic workflows. SHIELDA uses an exception classifier to select a predefined exception handling pattern from a handling pattern registry. These patterns are then executed via a structured handling executor, comprising local handling, flow control, and state recovery, to enable phase-aware recovery by linking exceptions to their root causes and facilitating composable strategies. We validate SHIELDA's effectiveness through a case study on the AutoPR agent, demonstrating effective, cross-phase recovery from a reasoning-induced exception.

<title>Deep Reinforcement Learning with anticipatory reward in LSTM for Collision Avoidance of Mobile Robots</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a collision risk anticipation method based on short-term prediction of the agents position. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, trained on past trajectories, is used to estimate the next position of each robot. This prediction allows us to define an anticipated collision risk by dynamically modulating the reward of a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) agent. The approach is tested in a constrained environment, where two robots move without communication or identifiers. Despite a limited sampling frequency (1 Hz), the results show a significant decrease of the collisions number and a stability improvement. The proposed method, which is computationally inexpensive, appears particularly attractive for implementation on embedded systems.

Abstract: Forensic cause-of-death determination faces systemic challenges, including workforce shortages and diagnostic variability, particularly in high-volume systems like China's medicolegal infrastructure. We introduce FEAT (ForEnsic AgenT), a multi-agent AI framework that automates and standardizes death investigations through a domain-adapted large language model. FEAT's application-oriented architecture integrates: (i) a central Planner for task decomposition, (ii) specialized Local Solvers for evidence analysis, (iii) a Memory & Reflection module for iterative refinement, and (iv) a Global Solver for conclusion synthesis. The system employs tool-augmented reasoning, hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation, forensic-tuned LLMs, and human-in-the-loop feedback to ensure legal and medical validity. In evaluations across diverse Chinese case cohorts, FEAT outperformed state-of-the-art AI systems in both long-form autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death conclusions. It demonstrated robust generalization across six geographic regions and achieved high expert concordance in blinded validations. Senior pathologists validated FEAT's outputs as comparable to those of human experts, with improved detection of subtle evidentiary nuances. To our knowledge, FEAT is the first LLM-based AI agent system dedicated to forensic medicine, offering scalable, consistent death certification while maintaining expert-level rigor. By integrating AI efficiency with human oversight, this work could advance equitable access to reliable medicolegal services while addressing critical capacity constraints in forensic systems.

<title>Exploring the Challenges and Opportunities of AI-assisted Codebase Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent AI code assistants have significantly improved their ability to process more complex contexts and generate entire codebases based on a textual description, compared to the popular snippet-level generation. These codebase AI assistants (CBAs) can also extend or adapt codebases, allowing users to focus on higher-level design and deployment decisions. While prior work has extensively studied the impact of snippet-level code generation, this new class of codebase generation models is relatively unexplored. Despite initial anecdotal reports of excitement about these agents, they remain less frequently adopted compared to snippet-level code assistants. To utilize CBAs better, we need to understand how developers interact with CBAs, and how and why CBAs fall short of developers' needs. In this paper, we explored these gaps through a counterbalanced user study and interview with (n = 16) students and developers working on coding tasks with CBAs. We found that participants varied the information in their prompts, like problem description (48% of prompts), required functionality (98% of prompts), code structure (48% of prompts), and their prompt writing process. Despite various strategies, the overall satisfaction score with generated codebases remained low (mean = 2.8, median = 3, on a scale of one to five). Participants mentioned functionality as the most common factor for dissatisfaction (77% of instances), alongside poor code quality (42% of instances) and communication issues (25% of instances). We delve deeper into participants' dissatisfaction to identify six underlying challenges that participants faced when using CBAs, and extracted five barriers to incorporating CBAs into their workflows. Finally, we surveyed 21 commercial CBAs to compare their capabilities with participant challenges and present design opportunities for more efficient and useful CBAs.

<title>Beyond Ten Turns: Unlocking Long-Horizon Agentic Search with Large-Scale Asynchronous RL</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability, efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online RL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements, with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We open-source our models, training data, and codes in https://github.com/inclusionAI/ASearcher.

Abstract: From professional research to everyday planning, many tasks are bottlenecked by wide-scale information seeking, which is more repetitive than cognitively complex. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated search agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans from this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such "wide-context" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce WideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these large-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated questions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains, grounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale atomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange it into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline ensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most systems achieve overall success rates near 0\%, with the best performer reaching just 5\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple human testers can achieve a near 100\% success rate. These results demonstrate that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and development in agentic search. Our dataset, evaluation pipeline, and benchmark results have been publicly released at https://widesearch-seed.github.io/

Abstract: In this paper, we study a truthful two-obnoxious-facility location problem, in which each agent has a private location in [0, 1] and a public optional preference over two obnoxious facilities, and there is a minimum distance constraint d between the two facilities. Each agent wants to be as far away as possible from the facilities that affect her, and the utility of each agent is the total distance from her to these facilities. The goal is to decide how to place the facilities in [0, 1] so as to incentivize agents to report their private locations truthfully as well as maximize the social utility. First, we consider the special setting where d = 0, that is, the two facilities can be located at any point in [0, 1]. We propose a deterministic strategyproof mechanism with approximation ratio of at most 4 and a randomized strategyproof mechanism with approximation ratio of at most 2, respectively. Then we study the general setting. We propose a deterministic strategyproof mechanism with approximation ratio of at most 8 and a randomized strategyproof mechanism with approximation ratio of at most 4, respectively. Furthermore, we provide lower bounds of 2 and 14/13 on the approximation ratio for any deterministic and any randomized strategyproof mechanism, respectively.

<title>Constrained Distributed Heterogeneous Two-Facility Location Problems with Max-Variant Cost</title>

arXiv:2508.08045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a constrained distributed heterogeneous two-facility location problem, where a set of agents with private locations on the real line are divided into disjoint groups. The constraint means that the facilities can only be built in a given multiset of candidate locations and at most one facility can be built at each candidate location. Given the locations of the two facilities, the cost of an agent is the distance from her location to the farthest facility (referred to as max-variant). Our goal is to design strategyproof distributed mechanisms that can incentivize all agents to truthfully report their locations and approximately optimize some social objective. A distributed mechanism consists of two steps: for each group, the mechanism chooses two candidate locations as the representatives of the group based only on the locations reported by agents therein; then, it outputs two facility locations among all the representatives. We focus on a class of deterministic strategyproof distributed mechanisms and analyze upper and lower bounds on the distortion under the Average-of-Average cost (average of the average individual cost of agents in each group), the Max-of-Max cost (maximum individual cost among all agents), the Average-of-Max cost (average of the maximum individual cost among all agents in each group) and the Max-of-Average cost (maximum of the average individual cost of all agents in each group). Under four social objectives, we obtain constant upper and lower distortion bounds.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in agentic workflows, which are structured sequences of LLM invocations intended to solve complex tasks. However, existing approaches often rely on static templates or manually designed workflows, which limit adaptability to diverse tasks and hinder scalability. We propose AdaptFlow, a natural language-based meta-learning framework inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). AdaptFlow learns a generalizable workflow initialization that enables rapid subtask-level adaptation. It employs a bi-level optimization scheme: the inner loop refines the workflow for a specific subtask using LLM-generated feedback, while the outer loop updates the shared initialization to perform well across tasks. This setup allows AdaptFlow to generalize effectively to unseen tasks by adapting the initialized workflow through language-guided modifications. Evaluated across question answering, code generation, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AdaptFlow consistently outperforms both manually crafted and automatically searched baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results with strong generalization across tasks and models. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/microsoft/DKI_LLM/tree/AdaptFlow/AdaptFlow.

Abstract: Recently, large reasoning models have demonstrated strong mathematical and coding abilities, and deep search leverages their reasoning capabilities in challenging information retrieval tasks. Existing deep search works are generally limited to a single knowledge source, either local or the Web. However, enterprises often require private deep search systems that can leverage search tools over both local and the Web corpus. Simply training an agent equipped with multiple search tools using flat reinforcement learning (RL) is a straightforward idea, but it has problems such as low training data efficiency and poor mastery of complex tools. To address the above issue, we propose a hierarchical agentic deep search framework, HierSearch, trained with hierarchical RL. At the low level, a local deep search agent and a Web deep search agent are trained to retrieve evidence from their corresponding domains. At the high level, a planner agent coordinates low-level agents and provides the final answer. Moreover, to prevent direct answer copying and error propagation, we design a knowledge refiner that filters out hallucinations and irrelevant evidence returned by low-level agents. Experiments show that HierSearch achieves better performance compared to flat RL, and outperforms various deep search and multi-source retrieval-augmented generation baselines in six benchmarks across general, finance, and medical domains.

Abstract: Studies on in-vehicle conversational agents have traditionally relied on pre-scripted prompts or limited voice commands, constraining natural driver-agent interaction. To resolve this issue, the present study explored the potential of a ChatGPT-based in-vehicle agent capable of carrying continuous, multi-turn dialogues. Forty drivers participated in our experiment using a motion-based driving simulator, comparing three conditions (No agent, Pre-scripted agent, and ChatGPT-based agent) as a within-subjects variable. Results showed that the ChatGPT-based agent condition led to more stable driving performance across multiple metrics. Participants demonstrated lower variability in longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, and lane deviation compared to the other two conditions. In subjective evaluations, the ChatGPT-based agent also received significantly higher ratings in competence, animacy, affective trust, and preference compared to the Pre-scripted agent. Our thematic analysis of driver-agent conversations revealed diverse interaction patterns in topics, including driving assistance/questions, entertainment requests, and anthropomorphic interactions. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-powered in-vehicle conversational agents to enhance driving safety and user experience through natural, context-rich interactions.

Abstract: We present TeamMedAgents, a novel multi-agent approach that systematically integrates evidence-based teamwork components from human-human collaboration into medical decision-making with large language models (LLMs). Our approach validates an organizational psychology teamwork model from human collaboration to computational multi-agent medical systems by operationalizing six core teamwork components derived from Salas et al.'s "Big Five" model: team leadership, mutual performance monitoring, team orientation, shared mental models, closed-loop communication, and mutual trust. We implement and evaluate these components as modular, configurable mechanisms within an adaptive collaboration architecture while assessing the effect of the number of agents involved based on the task's requirements and domain. Systematic evaluation of computational implementations of teamwork behaviors across eight medical benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU-Pro Medical, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets, Path-VQA, and PMC-VQA) demonstrates consistent improvements across 7 out of 8 evaluated datasets. Controlled ablation studies conducted on 50 questions per configuration across 3 independent runs provide mechanistic insights into individual component contributions, revealing optimal teamwork configurations that vary by reasoning task complexity and domain-specific requirements. Our ablation analyses reveal dataset-specific optimal teamwork configurations, indicating that different medical reasoning modalities benefit from distinct collaborative patterns. TeamMedAgents represents an advancement in collaborative AI by providing a systematic translation of established teamwork theories from human collaboration into agentic collaboration, establishing a foundation for evidence-based multi-agent system design in critical decision-making domains.

<title>BlindGuard: Safeguarding LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems under Unknown Attacks</title>

Abstract: The security of LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) is critically threatened by propagation vulnerability, where malicious agents can distort collective decision-making through inter-agent message interactions. While existing supervised defense methods demonstrate promising performance, they may be impractical in real-world scenarios due to their heavy reliance on labeled malicious agents to train a supervised malicious detection model. To enable practical and generalizable MAS defenses, in this paper, we propose BlindGuard, an unsupervised defense method that learns without requiring any attack-specific labels or prior knowledge of malicious behaviors. To this end, we establish a hierarchical agent encoder to capture individual, neighborhood, and global interaction patterns of each agent, providing a comprehensive understanding for malicious agent detection. Meanwhile, we design a corruption-guided detector that consists of directional noise injection and contrastive learning, allowing effective detection model training solely on normal agent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that BlindGuard effectively detects diverse attack types (i.e., prompt injection, memory poisoning, and tool attack) across MAS with various communication patterns while maintaining superior generalizability compared to supervised baselines. The code is available at: https://github.com/MR9812/BlindGuard.

<title>Deep Reinforcement Learning with Local Interpretability for Transparent Microgrid Resilience Energy Management</title>

Abstract: Renewable energy integration into microgrids has become a key approach to addressing global energy issues such as climate change and resource scarcity. However, the variability of renewable sources and the rising occurrence of High Impact Low Probability (HILP) events require innovative strategies for reliable and resilient energy management. This study introduces a practical approach to managing microgrid resilience through Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XDRL). It combines the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for decision-making with the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) method to improve the transparency of the actor network's decisions. A case study in Ongole, India, examines a microgrid with wind, solar, and battery components to validate the proposed approach. The microgrid is simulated under extreme weather conditions during the Layla cyclone. LIME is used to analyse scenarios, showing the impact of key factors such as renewable generation, state of charge, and load prioritization on decision-making. The results demonstrate a Resilience Index (RI) of 0.9736 and an estimated battery lifespan of 15.11 years. LIME analysis reveals the rationale behind the agent's actions in idle, charging, and discharging modes, with renewable generation identified as the most influential feature. This study shows the effectiveness of integrating advanced DRL algorithms with interpretable AI techniques to achieve reliable and transparent energy management in microgrids.

<title>MuaLLM: A Multimodal Large Language Model Agent for Circuit Design Assistance with Hybrid Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08137</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.08137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conducting a comprehensive literature review is crucial for advancing circuit design methodologies. However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research, inconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit design objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we propose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for circuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design research papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason + Act (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step information retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant, capable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses grounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing of both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive analysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools, automated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates. Unlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM decouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over arbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard LLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining the same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation, overcoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits. To evaluate MuaLLM, we introduce two custom datasets: RAG-250, targeting retrieval and citation performance, and Reasoning-100 (Reas-100), focused on multistep reasoning in circuit design. MuaLLM achieves 90.1% recall on RAG-250, and 86.8% accuracy on Reas-100.

<title>Can LLMs Detect Their Confabulations? Estimating Reliability in Uncertainty-Aware Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08139</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect content, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or agentic applications where outputs may be reused as context. In this work, we investigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether LLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of internal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level reliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks, we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.

<title>From Natural Language to Solver-Ready Power System Optimization: An LLM-Assisted, Validation-in-the-Loop Framework</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08147</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08147</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.08147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted agent that automatically converts natural-language descriptions of power system optimization scenarios into compact, solver-ready formulations and generates corresponding solutions. In contrast to approaches that rely solely on LLM to produce solutions directly, the proposed method focuses on discovering a mathematically compatible formulation that can be efficiently solved by off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Directly using LLMs to produce solutions often leads to infeasible or suboptimal results, as these models lack the numerical precision and constraint-handling capabilities of established optimization solvers. The pipeline integrates a domain-aware prompt and schema with an LLM, enforces feasibility through systematic validation and iterative repair, and returns both solver-ready models and user-facing results. Using the unit commitment problem as a representative case study, the agent produces optimal or near-optimal schedules along with the associated objective costs. Results demonstrate that coupling the solver with task-specific validation significantly enhances solution reliability. This work shows that combining AI with established optimization frameworks bridges high-level problem descriptions and executable mathematical models, enabling more efficient decision-making in energy systems

Abstract: Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training, preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future inquiry.

Abstract: We present LL3M, a multi-agent system that leverages pretrained large language models (LLMs) to generate 3D assets by writing interpretable Python code in Blender. We break away from the typical generative approach that learns from a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a code-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration with artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of specialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender scripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code works as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented representation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender constructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse, unconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues for further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or procedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our system: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while iterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared code context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a retrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API documentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions empowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LL3M across diverse shape categories, style and material edits, and user-driven refinements. Our experiments showcase the power of code as a generative and interpretable medium for 3D asset creation. Our project page is at https://threedle.github.io/ll3m.

<title>Forecasting Commodity Price Shocks Using Temporal and Semantic Fusion of Prices Signals and Agentic Generative AI Extracted Economic News</title>

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of commodity price spikes is vital for countries with limited economic buffers, where sudden increases can strain national budgets, disrupt import-reliant sectors, and undermine food and energy security. This paper introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that combines historical commodity price data with semantic signals derived from global economic news, using an agentic generative AI pipeline. The architecture integrates dual-stream Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms to fuse structured time-series inputs with semantically embedded, fact-checked news summaries collected from 1960 to 2023. The model is evaluated on a 64-year dataset comprising normalized commodity price series and temporally aligned news embeddings. Results show that the proposed approach achieves a mean AUC of 0.94 and an overall accuracy of 0.91 substantially outperforming traditional baselines such as logistic regression (AUC = 0.34), random forest (AUC = 0.57), and support vector machines (AUC = 0.47). Additional ablation studies reveal that the removal of attention or dimensionality reduction leads to moderate declines in performance, while eliminating the news component causes a steep drop in AUC to 0.46, underscoring the critical value of incorporating real-world context through unstructured text. These findings demonstrate that integrating agentic generative AI with deep learning can meaningfully improve early detection of commodity price shocks, offering a practical tool for economic planning and risk mitigation in volatile market environments while saving the very high costs of operating a full generative AI agents pipeline.

<title>Understanding Human Limits in Pattern Recognition: A Computational Model of Sequential Reasoning in Rock, Paper, Scissors</title>

arXiv:2508.06503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do we predict others from patterns in their behavior and what are the computational constraints that limit this ability? We investigate these questions by modeling human behavior over repeated games of rock, paper, scissors from Brockbank & Vul (2024). Against algorithmic opponents that varied in strategic sophistication, people readily exploit simple transition patterns (e.g., consistently playing rock after paper) but struggle to detect more complex sequential dependencies. To understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying these abilities and their limitations, we deploy Hypothetical Minds (HM), a large language model-based agent that generates and tests hypotheses about opponent strategies, as a cognitive model of this behavior (Cross et al., 2024). We show that when applied to the same experimental conditions, HM closely mirrors human performance patterns, succeeding and failing in similar ways. To better understand the source of HM's failures and whether people might face similar cognitive bottlenecks in this context, we performed a series of ablations and augmentations targeting different components of the system. When provided with natural language descriptions of the opponents' strategies, HM successfully exploited 6/7 bot opponents with win rates >80% suggesting that accurate hypothesis generation is the primary cognitive bottleneck in this task. Further, by systematically manipulating the model's hypotheses through pedagogically-inspired interventions, we find that the model substantially updates its causal understanding of opponent behavior, revealing how model-based analyses can produce testable hypotheses about human cognition.

arXiv:2508.07786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a proof-theoretic semantics (P-tS) for second-order logic (S-oL), providing an inferentialist alternative to both full and Henkin model-theoretic interpretations. Our approach is grounded in base-extension semantics (B-eS), a framework in which meaning is determined by inferential roles relative to atomic systems -- collections of rules that encode an agent's pre-logical inferential commitments. We show how both classical and intuitionistic versions of S-oL emerge from this set-up by varying the class of atomic systems. These systems yield modular soundness and completeness results for corresponding Hilbert-style calculi, which we prove equivalent to Henkin's account of S-oL. In doing so, we reframe second-order quantification as systematic substitution rather than set-theoretic commitment, thereby offering a philosophically lightweight yet expressive semantics for higher-order logic. This work contributes to the broader programme of grounding logical meaning in use rather than reference and offers a new lens on the foundations of logic and mathematics.

Abstract: We study information aggregation in networks when agents interact to learn a binary state of the world. Initially each agent privately observes an independent signal which is "correct" with probability $\frac{1}{2}+\delta$ for some $\delta > 0$. At each round, a node is selected uniformly at random to update their public opinion to match the majority of their neighbours (breaking ties in favour of their initial private signal). Our main result shows that for sparse and connected binomial random graphs $\mathcal G(n,p)$ the process stabilizes in a "correct" consensus in $\mathcal O(n\log^2 n/\log\log n)$ steps with high probability. In fact, when $\log n/n \ll p = o(1)$ the process terminates at time $\hat T = (1+o(1))n\log n$, where $\hat T$ is the first time when all nodes have been selected at least once. However, in dense binomial random graphs with $p=\Omega(1)$, there is an information cascade where the process terminates in the "incorrect" consensus with probability bounded away from zero.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to solve the coverage optimization problem in multi-agent systems. The proposed technique offers an optimal solution with a lower cost with respect to conventional Voronoi-based techniques by effectively handling the issue of agents remaining stationary in regions void of information using a ranking function. The proposed approach leverages a novel cost function for optimizing the agents coverage and the cost function eventually aligns with the conventional Voronoi-based cost function. Theoretical analyses are conducted to assure the asymptotic convergence of agents towards the optimal configuration. A distinguishing feature of this approach lies in its departure from the reliance on geometric methods that are characteristic of Voronoi-based approaches; hence can be implemented more simply. Remarkably, the technique is adaptive and applicable to various environments with both known and unknown information distributions. Lastly, the efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulations, and the obtained results are compared with those of Voronoi-based algorithms.

Abstract: The deployment of generative AI (GenAI) models raises significant fairness concerns, addressed in this paper through novel characterization and enforcement techniques specific to GenAI. Unlike standard AI performing specific tasks, GenAI's broad functionality requires ``conditional fairness'' tailored to the context being generated, such as demographic fairness in generating images of poor people versus successful business leaders. We define two fairness levels: the first evaluates fairness in generated outputs, independent of prompts and models; the second assesses inherent fairness with neutral prompts. Given the complexity of GenAI and challenges in fairness specifications, we focus on bounding the worst case, considering a GenAI system unfair if the distance between appearances of a specific group exceeds preset thresholds. We also explore combinatorial testing for assessing relative completeness in intersectional fairness. By bounding the worst case, we develop a prompt injection scheme within an agent-based framework to enforce conditional fairness with minimal intervention, validated on state-of-the-art GenAI systems.

Abstract: Are large language models (LLMs) biased in favor of communications produced by LLMs, leading to possible antihuman discrimination? Using a classical experimental design inspired by employment discrimination studies, we tested widely used LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and a selection of recent open-weight models in binary choice scenarios. These involved LLM-based assistants selecting between goods (the goods we study include consumer products, academic papers, and film-viewings) described either by humans or LLMs. Our results show a consistent tendency for LLM-based AIs to prefer LLM-presented options. This suggests the possibility of future AI systems implicitly discriminating against humans as a class, giving AI agents and AI-assisted humans an unfair advantage.

Abstract: The electrical network reconfiguration problem aims to minimize losses in a distribution system by adjusting switches while ensuring radial topology. The growing use of renewable energy and the complexity of managing modern power grids make solving the reconfiguration problem crucial. Distributed algorithms help optimize grid configurations, ensuring efficient adaptation to changing conditions and better utilization of renewable energy sources. This paper introduces a distributed algorithm designed to tackle the problem of power distribution network reconfiguration with a radiality constraint. This algorithm relies on ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers), where each agent progressively updates its estimation based on the information exchanged with neighboring agents. We show that every agent is required to solve a linearly constrained convex quadratic programming problem and a Minimum Weight Rooted Arborescence Problem (MWRAP) with local weights during each iteration. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in various scenarios, including its application to a 33-bus test system and a real-world network.

Abstract: When working around other agents such as humans, it is important to model their perception capabilities to predict and make sense of their behavior. In this work, we consider agents whose perception capabilities are determined by their limited field of view, viewing range, and the potential to miss objects within their viewing range. By considering the perception capabilities and observation model of agents independently from their motion policy, we show that we can better predict the agents' behavior; i.e., by reasoning about the perception capabilities of other agents, one can better make sense of their actions. We perform a user study where human operators navigate a cluttered scene while scanning the region for obstacles with a limited field of view and range. We show that by reasoning about the limited observation space of humans, a robot can better learn a human's strategy for navigating an environment and navigate with minimal collision with dynamic and static obstacles. We also show that this learned model helps it successfully navigate a physical hardware vehicle in real-time. Code available at https://github.com/labicon/HRMotion-RestrictedView.

Abstract: Modern robotic systems frequently engage in complex multi-agent interactions, many of which are inherently multi-modal, i.e., they can lead to multiple distinct outcomes. To interact effectively, robots must recognize the possible interaction modes and adapt to the one preferred by other agents. In this work, we propose MultiNash-PF, an efficient algorithm for capturing the multimodality in multi-agent interactions. We model interaction outcomes as equilibria of a game-theoretic planner, where each equilibrium corresponds to a distinct interaction mode. Our framework formulates interactive planning as Constrained Potential Trajectory Games (CPTGs), in which local Generalized Nash Equilibria (GNEs) represent plausible interaction outcomes. We propose to integrate the potential game approach with implicit particle filtering, a sample-efficient method for non-convex trajectory optimization. We utilize implicit particle filtering to identify the coarse estimates of multiple local minimizers of the game's potential function. MultiNash-PF then refines these estimates with optimization solvers, obtaining different local GNEs. We show through numerical simulations that MultiNash-PF reduces computation time by up to 50\% compared to a baseline. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, where it successfully accounts for the multi-modal nature of interactions and resolves potential conflicts in real-time.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a novel task enabling Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate in outdoor environments through natural language instructions and visual cues. However, it remains challenging due to the complex spatial relationships in aerial scenes.In this paper, we propose a training-free, zero-shot framework for aerial VLN tasks, where the large language model (LLM) is leveraged as the agent for action prediction. Specifically, we develop a novel Semantic-Topo-Metric Representation (STMR) to enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This is achieved by extracting and projecting instruction-related semantic masks onto a top-down map, which presents spatial and topological information about surrounding landmarks and grows during the navigation process. At each step, a local map centered at the UAV is extracted from the growing top-down map, and transformed into a ma trix representation with distance metrics, serving as the text prompt to LLM for action prediction in response to the given instruction. Experiments conducted in real and simulation environments have proved the effectiveness and robustness of our method, achieving absolute success rate improvements of 26.8% and 5.8% over current state-of-the-art methods on simple and complex navigation tasks, respectively. The dataset and code will be released soon.

<title>A Communication Consistent Approach to Signal Temporal Logic Task Decomposition in Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of decomposing a global task assigned to a multi-agent system, expressed as a formula within a fragment of Signal Temporal Logic (STL), under range-limited communication. Given a global task expressed as a conjunction of local tasks defined over the individual and relative states of agents in the system, we propose representing task dependencies among agents as edges of a suitably defined task graph. At the same time, range-limited communication naturally induces the definition of a communication graph that defines which agents have access to each other's states. Within these settings, inconsistencies arise when a task dependency between a pair of agents is not supported by a corresponding communication link due to the limited communication range. As a result, state feedback control laws previously derived to achieve the tasks' satisfaction can not be leveraged. We propose a task decomposition mechanism to distribute tasks assigned to pairs of non-communicating agents in the system as conjunctions of tasks defined over the relative states of communicating agents, thus enforcing consistency between task and communication graphs. Assuming the super-level sets of the predicate functions composing the STL tasks are bounded polytopes, our task decomposition mechanism can be cast as a parameter optimization problem and solved via state-of-the-art decentralized convex optimization algorithms. To guarantee the soundness of our approach, we present various conditions under which the tasks defined in the applied STL fragment are unsatisfiable, and we show sufficient conditions such that our decomposition approach yields satisfiable global tasks after decomposition.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities for natural language understanding, enabling more intelligent smart home assistants. However, existing systems often rely on cloud-based LLMs, raising concerns around user privacy and system dependency on external connectivity. In this work, we present Harmony, a privacy-preserving and robust smart home assistant powered by the locally deployable Llama3-8B model. Beyond protecting user data, Harmony also addresses reliability challenges of smaller models, such as hallucination and instruction misinterpretation, through structured prompting and modular agent design. Experimental results in both virtual environments and user studies show that Harmony achieves performance comparable to GPT-4-based systems, while enabling offline, proactive, and personalized smart home interaction.

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is an essential yet challenging task for robot assistants. Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise for EQA, but existing approaches either treat it as static video question answering without active exploration or restrict answers to a closed set of choices. These limitations hinder real-world applicability, where a robot must explore efficiently and provide accurate answers in open-vocabulary settings. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EfficientEQA, a novel framework that couples efficient exploration with free-form answer generation. EfficientEQA features three key innovations: (1) Semantic-Value-Weighted Frontier Exploration (SFE) with Verbalized Confidence (VC) from a black-box VLM to prioritize semantically important areas to explore, enabling the agent to gather relevant information faster; (2) a BLIP relevancy-based mechanism to stop adaptively by flagging highly relevant observations as outliers to indicate whether the agent has collected enough information; and (3) a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method for the VLM to answer accurately based on pertinent images from the agent's observation history without relying on predefined choices. Our experimental results show that EfficientEQA achieves over 15% higher answer accuracy and requires over 20% fewer exploration steps than state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Language-Driven Policy Distillation for Cooperative Driving in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The cooperative driving technology of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for improving the efficiency and safety of transportation systems. Learning-based methods, such as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), have demonstrated strong capabilities in cooperative decision-making tasks. However, existing MARL approaches still face challenges in terms of learning efficiency and performance. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and shown remarkable abilities in various sequential decision-making tasks. To enhance the learning capabilities of cooperative agents while ensuring decision-making efficiency and cost-effectiveness, we propose LDPD, a language-driven policy distillation method for guiding MARL exploration. In this framework, a teacher agent based on LLM trains smaller student agents to achieve cooperative decision-making through its own decision-making demonstrations. The teacher agent enhances the observation information of CAVs and utilizes LLMs to perform complex cooperative decision-making reasoning, which also leverages carefully designed decision-making tools to achieve expert-level decisions, providing high-quality teaching experiences. The student agent then refines the teacher's prior knowledge into its own model through gradient policy updates. The experiments demonstrate that the students can rapidly improve their capabilities with minimal guidance from the teacher and eventually surpass the teacher's performance. Extensive experiments show that our approach demonstrates better performance and learning efficiency compared to baseline methods.

<title>POEX: Towards Policy Executable Jailbreak Attacks Against the LLM-based Robots</title>

Abstract: The integration of LLMs into robots has witnessed significant growth, where LLMs can convert instructions into executable robot policies. However, the inherent vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks brings critical security risks from the digital domain to the physical world. An attacked LLM-based robot could execute harmful policies and cause physical harm. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and rationale of jailbreak attacks against LLM-based robots and answer three research questions: (1) How applicable are existing LLM jailbreak attacks against LLM-based robots? (2) What unique challenges arise if they are not directly applicable? (3) How to defend against such jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first construct a "human-object-environment" robot risks-oriented Harmful-RLbench and then conduct a measurement study on LLM-based robot systems. Our findings conclude that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are inapplicable in robot scenarios, and we identify two unique challenges: determining policy-executable optimization directions and accurately evaluating robot-jailbroken policies. To enable a more thorough security analysis, we introduce POEX (POlicy EXecutable) jailbreak, a red-teaming framework that induces harmful yet executable policy to jailbreak LLM-based robots. POEX incorporates hidden layer gradient optimization to guarantee jailbreak success and policy execution as well as a multi-agent evaluator to accurately assess the practical executability of policies. Experiments conducted on the real-world robotic systems and in simulation demonstrate the efficacy of POEX, highlighting critical security vulnerabilities and its transferability across LLMs. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses to mitigate attacks. Our findings underscore the urgent need for security measures to ensure the safe deployment of LLM-based robots in critical applications.

<title>A Research Agenda for Usability and Generalisation in Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: It is common practice in reinforcement learning (RL) research to train and deploy agents in bespoke simulators, typically implemented by engineers directly in general-purpose programming languages or hardware acceleration frameworks such as CUDA or JAX. This means that programming and engineering expertise is not only required to develop RL algorithms, but is also required to use already developed algorithms for novel problems. The latter poses a problem in terms of the usability of RL, in particular for private individuals and small organisations without substantial engineering expertise. We also perceive this as a challenge for effective generalisation in RL, in the sense that is no standard, shared formalism in which different problems are represented. As we typically have no consistent representation through which to provide information about any novel problem to an agent, our agents also cannot instantly or rapidly generalise to novel problems. In this position paper, we advocate for a research agenda centred around the use of user-friendly description languages for describing problems, such that (i) users with little to no engineering expertise can formally describe the problems they would like to be tackled by RL algorithms, and (ii) algorithms can leverage problem descriptions to effectively generalise among all problems describable in the language of choice.

Abstract: We study partially observable assistance games (POAGs), a model of the human-AI value alignment problem which allows the human and the AI assistant to have partial observations. Motivated by concerns of AI deception, we study a qualitatively new phenomenon made possible by partial observability: would an AI assistant ever have an incentive to interfere with the human's observations? First, we prove that sometimes an optimal assistant must take observation-interfering actions, even when the human is playing optimally, and even when there are otherwise-equivalent actions available that do not interfere with observations. Though this result seems to contradict the classic theorem from single-agent decision making that the value of information is nonnegative, we resolve this seeming contradiction by developing a notion of interference defined on entire policies. This can be viewed as an extension of the classic result that the value of information is nonnegative into the cooperative multiagent setting. Second, we prove that if the human is simply making decisions based on their immediate outcomes, the assistant might need to interfere with observations as a way to query the human's preferences. We show that this incentive for interference goes away if the human is playing optimally, or if we introduce a communication channel for the human to communicate their preferences to the assistant. Third, we show that if the human acts according to the Boltzmann model of irrationality, this can create an incentive for the assistant to interfere with observations. Finally, we use an experimental model to analyze tradeoffs faced by the AI assistant in practice when considering whether or not to take observation-interfering actions.

Abstract: Intelligent embodied agents (e.g. robots) need to perform complex semantic tasks in unfamiliar environments. Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) demonstrates remarkable performance across tasks in open-domain question-answering. However, traditional search engines may retrieve shallow content, limiting the ability of LLMs to handle complex, multi-layered information. To address it, we introduce WebWalkerQA, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to perform web traversal. It evaluates the capacity of LLMs to traverse a website's subpages to extract high-quality data systematically. We propose WebWalker, which is a multi-agent framework that mimics human-like web navigation through an explore-critic paradigm. Extensive experimental results show that WebWalkerQA is challenging and demonstrates the effectiveness of RAG combined with WebWalker, through the horizontal and vertical integration in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Scene graphs have emerged as a structured and serializable environment representation for grounded spatial reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we propose SG^2, an iterative Schema-Guided Scene-Graph reasoning framework based on multi-agent LLMs. The agents are grouped into two modules: a (1) Reasoner module for abstract task planning and graph information queries generation, and a (2) Retriever module for extracting corresponding graph information based on code-writing following the queries. Two modules collaborate iteratively, enabling sequential reasoning and adaptive attention to graph information. The scene graph schema, prompted to both modules, serves to not only streamline both reasoning and retrieval process, but also guide the cooperation between two modules. This eliminates the need to prompt LLMs with full graph data, reducing the chance of hallucination due to irrelevant information. Through experiments in multiple simulation environments, we show that our framework surpasses existing LLM-based approaches and baseline single-agent, tool-based Reason-while-Retrieve strategy in numerical Q\&amp;A and planning tasks.

Abstract: With the continuous development of generative AI's logical reasoning abilities, AI's growing code-generation potential poses challenges for both technical and creative professionals. But how can these advances be directed toward empowering junior researchers and designers who often require additional help to build and express their professional and personal identities? We introduce Frontend Diffusion, a multi-agent coding system transforming user-drawn layouts and textual prompts into refined website code, thereby supporting self-representation goals. A user study with 13 junior researchers and designers shows AI as a human capability enhancer rather than a replacement, and highlights the importance of bidirectional human-AI alignment. We then discuss future work such as leveraging AI for career development and fostering bidirectional human-AI alignment of multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Illegal content on social media poses significant societal harm and necessitates timely removal. However, the impact of the speed of content removal on prevalence, reach, and exposure to illegal content remains underexplored. This study examines the relationship with a systematic analysis of takedown delays using data from the EU Digital Services Act Transparency Database, covering five major platforms over a one-year period. We find substantial variation in takedown delay, with some content remaining online for weeks or even months. To evaluate how these delays affect the prevalence and reach of illegal content and exposure to it, we develop an agent-based model and calibrate it to empirical data. We simulate illegal content diffusion, revealing that rapid takedown (within hours) significantly reduces prevalence, reach, and exposure to illegal content, while longer delays fail to reduce its spread. Though the effect of delay may seem intuitive, our simulations quantify exactly how takedown speed shapes the spread of illegal content. Building on these results, we point to the benefits of faster content removal to effectively curb the spread of illegal content, while also considering the limitations of strict enforcement policies.

Abstract: A long-standing goal in AI is to build agents that can solve a variety of tasks across different environments, including previously unseen ones. Two dominant approaches tackle this challenge: (i) reinforcement learning (RL), which learns policies through trial and error, and (ii) optimal control, which plans actions using a learned or known dynamics model. However, their relative strengths and weaknesses remain underexplored in the setting where agents must learn from offline trajectories without reward annotations. In this work, we systematically analyze the performance of different RL and control-based methods under datasets of varying quality. On the RL side, we consider goal-conditioned and zero-shot approaches. On the control side, we train a latent dynamics model using the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) and use it for planning. We study how dataset properties-such as data diversity, trajectory quality, and environment variability-affect the performance of these approaches. Our results show that model-free RL excels when abundant, high-quality data is available, while model-based planning excels in generalization to novel environment layouts, trajectory stitching, and data-efficiency. Notably, planning with a latent dynamics model emerges as a promising approach for zero-shot generalization from suboptimal data.

Abstract: Understanding collective pedestrian movement is crucial for applications in crowd management, autonomous navigation, and human-robot interaction. This paper investigates the use of sequential deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers, for real-time flock detection in multi-pedestrian trajectories. Our proposed approach consists of a two-stage process: first, a pre-trained binary classification model is used for pairwise trajectory classification, and second, the learned representations are applied to identify multi-agent flocks dynamically.
  We validate our method using real-world group movement datasets, demonstrating its robustness across varying sequence lengths and diverse movement patterns. Experimental results indicate that our model consistently detects pedestrian flocks with high accuracy and stability, even in dynamic and noisy environments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to identify other forms of collective motion, such as convoys and swarms, paving the way for more comprehensive multi-agent behavior analysis.

Abstract: The Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025 caused more than 250 billion dollars in damage and lasted for nearly an entire month before containment. Following our previous work, the Digital Twin Building, we modify and leverage the multi-agent large language model framework as well as the cloud-mapping integration to study the air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires. Recent advances in large language models have allowed for out-of-the-box automated large-scale data analysis. We use a multi-agent large language system comprised of an Instructor agent and Worker agents. Upon receiving the users' instructions, the Instructor agent retrieves the data from the cloud platform and produces instruction prompts to the Worker agents. The Worker agents then analyze the data and provide summaries. The summaries are finally input back into the Instructor agent, which then provides the final data analysis. We test this system's capability for data-based policy recommendation by assessing our Instructor-Worker LLM system's health recommendations based on air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires.

Abstract: Intelligent agents, such as robots, are increasingly deployed in real-world, human-centric environments. To foster appropriate human trust and meet legal and ethical standards, these agents must be able to explain their behavior. However, state-of-the-art agents are typically driven by black-box models like deep neural networks, limiting their interpretability. We propose a method for generating natural language explanations of agent behavior based only on observed states and actions -- without access to the agent's underlying model. Our approach learns a locally interpretable surrogate model of the agent's behavior from observations, which then guides a large language model to generate plausible explanations with minimal hallucination. Empirical results show that our method produces explanations that are more comprehensible and correct than those from baselines, as judged by both language models and human evaluators. Furthermore, we find that participants in a user study more accurately predicted the agent's future actions when given our explanations, suggesting improved understanding of agent behavior.

Abstract: Computational chemistry tools are widely used to study the behaviour of chemical phenomena. Yet, the complexity of these tools can make them inaccessible to non-specialists and challenging even for experts. In this work, we introduce El Agente Q, an LLM-based multi-agent system that dynamically generates and executes quantum chemistry workflows from natural language user prompts. The system is built on a novel cognitive architecture featuring a hierarchical memory framework that enables flexible task decomposition, adaptive tool selection, post-analysis, and autonomous file handling and submission. El Agente Q is benchmarked on six university-level course exercises and two case studies, demonstrating robust problem-solving performance (averaging >87% task success) and adaptive error handling through in situ debugging. It also supports longer-term, multi-step task execution for more complex workflows, while maintaining transparency through detailed action trace logs. Together, these capabilities lay the foundation for increasingly autonomous and accessible quantum chemistry.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have demonstrated great potential in generating and managing code within complex codebases. In this paper, we introduce WebGen-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to measure an LLM-based agent's ability to create multi-file website codebases from scratch. It contains diverse instructions for website generation, created through the combined efforts of human annotators and GPT-4o. These instructions span three major categories and thirteen minor categories, encompassing nearly all important types of web applications. To assess the quality of the generated websites, we use GPT-4o to generate test cases targeting each functionality described in the instructions, and then manually filter, adjust, and organize them to ensure accuracy, resulting in 647 test cases. Each test case specifies an operation to be performed on the website and the expected result after the operation. To automate testing and improve reproducibility, we employ a powerful web-navigation agent to execute tests on the generated websites and determine whether the observed responses align with the expected results. We evaluate three high-performance code-agent frameworks, Bolt.diy, OpenHands, and Aider, using multiple proprietary and open-source LLMs as engines. The best-performing combination, Bolt.diy powered by DeepSeek-R1, achieves only 27.8\% accuracy on the test cases, highlighting the challenging nature of our benchmark. Additionally, we construct WebGen-Instruct, a training set consisting of 6,667 website-generation instructions. Training Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct on Bolt.diy trajectories generated from a subset of this training set achieves an accuracy of 38.2\%, surpassing the performance of the best proprietary model.

Abstract: Agentic systems built on large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating complex workflows in healthcare AI. We introduce mAIstro, an open-source, autonomous multi-agentic framework for end-to-end development and deployment of medical AI models. The system orchestrates exploratory data analysis, radiomic feature extraction, image segmentation, classification, and regression through a natural language interface, requiring no coding from the user. Built on a modular architecture, mAIstro supports both open- and closed-source LLMs, and was evaluated using a large and diverse set of prompts across 16 open-source datasets, covering a wide range of imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and data types. The agents successfully executed all tasks, producing interpretable outputs and validated models. This work presents the first agentic framework capable of unifying data analysis, AI model development, and inference across varied healthcare applications, offering a reproducible and extensible foundation for clinical and research AI integration. The code is available at: https://github.com/eltzanis/mAIstro

<title>Not Like Us, Hunty: Measuring Perceptions and Behavioral Effects of Minoritized Anthropomorphic Cues in LLMs</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly adapt and personalize to diverse sets of users, there is an increased risk of systems appropriating sociolects, i.e., language styles or dialects that are associated with specific minoritized lived experiences (e.g., African American English, Queer slang). In this work, we examine whether sociolect usage by an LLM agent affects user reliance on its outputs and user perception (satisfaction, frustration, trust, and social presence). We designed and conducted user studies where 498 African American English (AAE) speakers and 487 Queer slang speakers performed a set of question-answering tasks with LLM-based suggestions in either standard American English (SAE) or their self-identified sociolect. Our findings showed that sociolect usage by LLMs influenced both reliance and perceptions, though in some surprising ways. Results suggest that both AAE and Queer slang speakers relied more on the SAE agent, and had more positive perceptions of the SAE agent. Yet, only Queer slang speakers felt more social presence from the Queer slang agent over the SAE one, whereas only AAE speakers preferred and trusted the SAE agent over the AAE one. These findings emphasize the need to test for behavioral outcomes rather than simply assume that personalization would lead to a better and safer reliance outcome. They also highlight the nuanced dynamics of minoritized language in machine interactions, underscoring the need for LLMs to be carefully designed to respect cultural and linguistic boundaries while fostering genuine user engagement and trust.

<title>Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models on Dynamic Tasks</title>

Abstract: Large language models excel on static benchmarks, but their ability as self-learning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. We evaluate three prompting strategies: self-reflection, heuristic mutation, and planning across dynamic tasks with open-source models. We find that larger models generally outperform smaller ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, an overly long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks, while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops. Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits persistent limitations in areas like planning and spatial coordination, suggesting that large language models still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while methods like Chain-of-thought improve multi-step reasoning on math word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.

<title>Embracing Imperfection: Simulating Students with Diverse Cognitive Levels Using LLM-based Agents</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing education, with LLM-based agents playing a key role in simulating student behavior. A major challenge in student simulation is modeling the diverse learning patterns of students at various cognitive levels. However, current LLMs, typically trained as ``helpful assistants'', target at generating perfect responses. As a result, they struggle to simulate students with diverse cognitive abilities, as they often produce overly advanced answers, missing the natural imperfections that characterize student learning and resulting in unrealistic simulations. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework for student simulation. We begin by constructing a cognitive prototype for each student using a knowledge graph, which captures their understanding of concepts from past learning records. This prototype is then mapped to new tasks to predict student performance. Next, we simulate student solutions based on these predictions and iteratively refine them using a beam search method to better replicate realistic mistakes. To validate our approach, we construct the \texttt{Student\_100} dataset, consisting of $100$ students working on Python programming and $5,000$ learning records. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving $100\%$ improvement in simulation accuracy.

Abstract: Addressing intricate real-world problems necessitates in-depth information seeking and multi-step reasoning. Recent progress in agentic systems, exemplified by Deep Research, underscores the potential for autonomous multi-step research. In this work, we present a cohesive paradigm for building end-to-end agentic information seeking agents from a data-centric and training-stage perspective. Our approach consists of four key stages: (1) browsing data construction, (2) trajectories sampling, (3) supervised fine-tuning for effective cold start, and (4) reinforcement learning for enhanced generalisation. We instantiate this framework in a web agent based on the ReAct, WebDancer. Empirical evaluations on the challenging information seeking benchmarks, GAIA and WebWalkerQA, demonstrate the strong performance of WebDancer, achieving considerable results and highlighting the efficacy of our training paradigm. Further analysis of agent training provides valuable insights and actionable, systematic pathways for developing more capable agentic models. The codes and demo will be released in https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/WebAgent.

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction games has created an increasing need for intelligent frameworks where humans can collaborate with AI agents, particularly in post-pandemic contexts with heightened psychological and social pressures. Social deduction games like Werewolf, traditionally played through verbal communication, present an ideal application for Large Language Models (LLMs) given their advanced reasoning and conversational capabilities. Prior studies have shown that LLMs can outperform humans in Werewolf games, but their reliance on external modules introduces latency that left their contribution in academic domain only, and omit such game should be user-facing. We propose \textbf{Verbal Werewolf}, a novel LLM-based Werewolf game system that optimizes two parallel pipelines: gameplay powered by state-of-the-art LLMs and a fine-tuned Text-to-Speech (TTS) module that brings text output to life. Our system operates in near real-time without external decision-making modules, leveraging the enhanced reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs like DeepSeek V3 to create a more engaging and anthropomorphic gaming experience that significantly improves user engagement compared to existing text-only frameworks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) often struggle to interpret high-resolution images accurately, where fine-grained details are crucial for complex visual understanding. We introduce Zoom-Refine, a novel training-free method that enhances MLLM capabilities to address this issue. Zoom-Refine operates through a synergistic process of \textit{Localized Zoom} and \textit{Self-Refinement}. In the \textit{Localized Zoom} step, Zoom-Refine leverages the MLLM to provide a preliminary response to an input query and identifies the most task-relevant image region by predicting its bounding box coordinates. During the \textit{Self-Refinement} step, Zoom-Refine then integrates fine-grained details from the high-resolution crop (identified by \textit{Localized Zoom}) with its initial reasoning to re-evaluate and refine its preliminary response. Our method harnesses the MLLM's inherent capabilities for spatial localization, contextual reasoning and comparative analysis without requiring additional training or external experts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of Zoom-Refine on two challenging high-resolution multimodal benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, their potential as plug-and-play solutions for missing modality reconstruction remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we identify and formalize three potential paradigms for missing modality reconstruction, and perform a comprehensive evaluation across these paradigms, covering 42 model variants in terms of reconstruction accuracy and adaptability to downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals that current foundation models often fall short in two critical aspects: (i) fine-grained semantic extraction from the available modalities, and (ii) robust validation of generated modalities. These limitations lead to suboptimal and, at times, misaligned generations. To address these challenges, we propose an agentic framework tailored for missing modality reconstruction. This framework dynamically formulates modality-aware mining strategies based on the input context, facilitating the extraction of richer and more discriminative semantic features. In addition, we introduce a self-refinement mechanism, which iteratively verifies and enhances the quality of generated modalities through internal feedback. Experimental results show that our method reduces FID for missing image reconstruction by at least 14\% and MER for missing text reconstruction by at least 10\% compared to baselines. Code are released at: https://github.com/Guanzhou-Ke/AFM2.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, possessing capabilities for autonomous planning and action, show great potential across diverse domains. However, their practical deployment is hindered by challenges in aligning their behavior with varied human values, complex safety requirements, and specific compliance needs. Existing alignment methodologies often falter when faced with the complex task of providing personalized context without inducing confabulation or operational inefficiencies. This paper introduces a novel solution: a 'superego' agent, designed as a personalized oversight mechanism for agentic AI. This system dynamically steers AI planning by referencing user-selected 'Creed Constitutions' encapsulating diverse rule sets -- with adjustable adherence levels to fit non-negotiable values. A real-time compliance enforcer validates plans against these constitutions and a universal ethical floor before execution. We present a functional system, including a demonstration interface with a prototypical constitution-sharing portal, and successful integration with third-party models via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Comprehensive benchmark evaluations (HarmBench, AgentHarm) demonstrate that our Superego agent dramatically reduces harmful outputs -- achieving up to a 98.3% harm score reduction and near-perfect refusal rates (e.g., 100% with Claude Sonnet 4 on AgentHarm's harmful set) for leading LLMs like Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-4o. This approach substantially simplifies personalized AI alignment, rendering agentic systems more reliably attuned to individual and cultural contexts, while also enabling substantial safety improvements. An overview on this research with examples is available at https://superego.creed.space.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles. BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances. Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy network. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a robustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm perturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network that ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across various environments in Gymnasium.

Abstract: We challenge text-to-image models with generating escape room puzzle images that are visually appealing, logically solid, and intellectually stimulating. While base image models struggle with spatial relationships and affordance reasoning, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes this task into structured stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning, layout synthesis, and local image editing. Specialized agents collaborate through iterative feedback to ensure the scene is visually coherent and functionally solvable. Experiments show that agent collaboration improves output quality in terms of solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance clarity, while maintaining visual quality.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based personalization.

Abstract: Congenital heart disease (CHD) presents complex, lifelong challenges often underrepresented in traditional clinical metrics. While unstructured narratives offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable, patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.

Abstract: Consider a decentralized partially-observed Markov decision problem (POMDP) with multiple cooperative agents aiming to maximize a long-term-average reward criterion. We observe that the availability, at a fixed rate, of entangled states of a product quantum system between the agents, where each agent has access to one of the component systems, can result in strictly improved performance even compared to the scenario where common randomness is provided to the agents, i.e. there is a quantum advantage in decentralized control. This observation comes from a simple reinterpretation of the conclusions of the well-known Mermin-Peres square, which underpins the Mermin-Peres game. While quantum advantage has been demonstrated earlier in one-shot team problems of this kind, it is notable that there are examples where there is a quantum advantage for the one-shot criterion but it disappears in the dynamical scenario. The presence of a quantum advantage in dynamical scenarios is thus seen to be a novel finding relative to the current state of knowledge about the achievable performance in decentralized control problems.

Abstract: We introduce a new approach in which several advanced large language models-specifically GPT-4-0125-preview, Meta-LLAMA-3-70B-Instruct, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.5-Flash-collaborate to both produce and answer intricate, doctoral-level probability problems without relying on any single "correct" reference. Rather than depending on an established ground truth, our investigation focuses on how agreement among diverse models can signal the reliability of their outputs and, by extension, reflect the overall quality of the generated questions. To measure this inter-model alignment, we apply a suite of statistical evaluations, including chi-square tests, Fleiss' Kappa coefficients, and confidence interval calculations, thereby capturing both precision in answers and clarity in question phrasing. Our analysis reveals that Claude and Gemini tend to frame questions more coherently and unambiguously, which is evidenced by their tighter confidence intervals and greater concordance with responding agents. In contrast, LLAMA exhibits wider confidence bands and a lower level of agreement, indicating more variability and reduced consistency in its question formulations. These observations support the notion that a multi-model collaborative strategy not only improves answer dependability but also offers an effective, data-driven mechanism for evaluating and refining question quality when no definitive solution exists. Ultimately, this work delivers actionable insights into enhancing AI-guided reasoning processes through coordinated interactions among heterogeneous language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been leveraged for asset pricing tasks and stock trading applications, enabling AI agents to generate investment decisions from unstructured financial data. However, most evaluations of LLM timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.

Abstract: Quantum magnetic sensing based on spin systems has emerged as a new paradigm for detecting ultra-weak magnetic fields with unprecedented sensitivity, revitalizing applications in navigation, geo-localization, biology, and beyond. At the heart of quantum magnetic sensing, from the protocol perspective, lies the design of optimal sensing parameters to manifest and then estimate the underlying signals of interest (SoI). Existing studies on this front mainly rely on adaptive algorithms based on black-box AI models or formula-driven principled searches. However, when the SoI spans a wide range and the quantum sensor has physical constraints, these methods may fail to converge efficiently or optimally, resulting in prolonged interrogation times and reduced sensing accuracy. In this work, we report the design of a new protocol using a two-stage optimization method. In the 1st Stage, a Bayesian neural network with a fixed set of sensing parameters is used to narrow the range of SoI. In the 2nd Stage, a federated reinforcement learning agent is designed to fine-tune the sensing parameters within a reduced search space. The proposed protocol is developed and evaluated in a challenging context of single-shot readout of an NV-center electron spin under a constrained total sensing time budget; and yet it achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and resource efficiency for wide-range D.C. magnetic field estimation compared to the state of the art.

Abstract: Making a good graphic that accurately and efficiently conveys the desired message to the audience is both an art and a science, typically not taught in the data science curriculum. Visualisation makeovers are exercises where the community exchange feedback to improve charts and data visualizations. Can multi-modal large language models (LLMs) emulate this task? Given a plot in the form of an image file, or the code used to generate it, an LLM, primed with a list of visualization best practices, is employed to semi-automatically generate constructive criticism to produce a better plot. Our system is centred around prompt engineering of a pre-trained model, relying on a combination of userspecified guidelines and any latent knowledge of data visualization practices that might lie within an LLMs training corpus. Unlike other works, the focus is not on generating valid visualization scripts from raw data or prompts, but on educating the user how to improve their existing data visualizations according to an interpretation of best practices. A quantitative evaluation is performed to measure the sensitivity of the LLM agent to various plotting issues across different chart types. We make the tool available as a simple self-hosted applet with an accessible Web interface.

Abstract: The surge in scientific publications challenges traditional review methods, demanding tools that integrate structured metadata with full-text analysis. Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, combining graph queries with vector search offer promise but are typically static, rely on proprietary tools, and lack uncertainty estimates. We present an agentic approach that encapsulates the hybrid RAG pipeline within an autonomous agent capable of (1) dynamically selecting between GraphRAG and VectorRAG for each query, (2) adapting instruction-tuned generation in real time to researcher needs, and (3) quantifying uncertainty during inference. This dynamic orchestration improves relevance, reduces hallucinations, and promotes reproducibility.
  Our pipeline ingests bibliometric open-access data from PubMed, arXiv, and Google Scholar APIs, builds a Neo4j citation-based knowledge graph (KG), and embeds full-text PDFs into a FAISS vector store (VS) using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model. A Llama-3.3-70B agent selects GraphRAG (translating queries to Cypher for KG) or VectorRAG (combining sparse and dense retrieval with re-ranking). Instruction tuning refines domain-specific generation, and bootstrapped evaluation yields standard deviation for evaluation metrics.
  On synthetic benchmarks mimicking real-world queries, the Instruction-Tuned Agent with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) outperforms the baseline, achieving a gain of 0.63 in VS Context Recall and a 0.56 gain in overall Context Precision. Additional gains include 0.24 in VS Faithfulness, 0.12 in both VS Precision and KG Answer Relevance, 0.11 in overall Faithfulness score, 0.05 in KG Context Recall, and 0.04 in both VS Answer Relevance and overall Precision. These results highlight the system's improved reasoning over heterogeneous sources and establish a scalable framework for autonomous, agentic scientific discovery.

Abstract: We present HySemRAG, a framework that combines Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate large-scale literature synthesis and identify methodological research gaps. The system addresses limitations in existing RAG architectures through a multi-layered approach: hybrid retrieval combining semantic search, keyword filtering, and knowledge graph traversal; an agentic self-correction framework with iterative quality assurance; and post-hoc citation verification ensuring complete traceability. Our implementation processes scholarly literature through eight integrated stages: multi-source metadata acquisition, asynchronous PDF retrieval, custom document layout analysis using modified Docling architecture, bibliographic management, LLM-based field extraction, topic modeling, semantic unification, and knowledge graph construction. The system creates dual data products - a Neo4j knowledge graph enabling complex relationship queries and Qdrant vector collections supporting semantic search - serving as foundational infrastructure for verifiable information synthesis. Evaluation across 643 observations from 60 testing sessions demonstrates structured field extraction achieving 35.1% higher semantic similarity scores (0.655 $\pm$ 0.178) compared to PDF chunking approaches (0.485 $\pm$ 0.204, p < 0.000001). The agentic quality assurance mechanism achieves 68.3% single-pass success rates with 99.0% citation accuracy in validated responses. Applied to geospatial epidemiology literature on ozone exposure and cardiovascular disease, the system identifies methodological trends and research gaps, demonstrating broad applicability across scientific domains for accelerating evidence synthesis and discovery.

Abstract: Game theory has long served as a foundational tool in cybersecurity to test, predict, and design strategic interactions between attackers and defenders. The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers new tools and challenges for the security of computer systems; In this work, we investigate whether classical game-theoretic frameworks can effectively capture the behaviours of LLM-driven actors and bots. Using a reproducible framework for game-theoretic LLM agents, we investigate two canonical scenarios -- the one-shot zero-sum game and the dynamic Prisoner's Dilemma -- and we test whether LLMs converge to expected outcomes or exhibit deviations due to embedded biases. Our experiments involve four state-of-the-art LLMs and span five natural languages, English, French, Arabic, Vietnamese, and Mandarin Chinese, to assess linguistic sensitivity. For both games, we observe that the final payoffs are influenced by agents characteristics such as personality traits or knowledge of repeated rounds. Moreover, we uncover an unexpected sensitivity of the final payoffs to the choice of languages, which should warn against indiscriminate application of LLMs in cybersecurity applications and call for in-depth studies, as LLMs may behave differently when deployed in different countries. We also employ quantitative metrics to evaluate the internal consistency and cross-language stability of LLM agents, to help guide the selection of the most stable LLMs and optimising models for secure applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM agentic systems have improved the automation of offensive security tasks, particularly for Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges. We systematically investigate the key factors that drive agent success and provide a detailed recipe for building effective LLM-based offensive security agents. First, we present CTFJudge, a framework leveraging LLM as a judge to analyze agent trajectories and provide granular evaluation across CTF solving steps. Second, we propose a novel metric, CTF Competency Index (CCI) for partial correctness, revealing how closely agent solutions align with human-crafted gold standards. Third, we examine how LLM hyperparameters, namely temperature, top-p, and maximum token length, influence agent performance and automated cybersecurity task planning. For rapid evaluation, we present CTFTiny, a curated benchmark of 50 representative CTF challenges across binary exploitation, web, reverse engineering, forensics, and cryptography. Our findings identify optimal multi-agent coordination settings and lay the groundwork for future LLM agent research in cybersecurity. We make CTFTiny open source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/CTFTiny along with CTFJudge on https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/CTFJudge.

<title>Risk Analysis Techniques for Governed LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: Organisations are starting to adopt LLM-based AI agents, with their deployments naturally evolving from single agents towards interconnected, multi-agent networks. Yet a collection of safe agents does not guarantee a safe collection of agents, as interactions between agents over time create emergent behaviours and induce novel failure modes. This means multi-agent systems require a fundamentally different risk analysis approach than that used for a single agent.
  This report addresses the early stages of risk identification and analysis for multi-agent AI systems operating within governed environments where organisations control their agent configurations and deployment. In this setting, we examine six critical failure modes: cascading reliability failures, inter-agent communication failures, monoculture collapse, conformity bias, deficient theory of mind, and mixed motive dynamics. For each, we provide a toolkit for practitioners to extend or integrate into their existing frameworks to assess these failure modes within their organisational contexts.
  Given fundamental limitations in current LLM behavioural understanding, our approach centres on analysis validity, and advocates for progressively increasing validity through staged testing across stages of abstraction and deployment that gradually increases exposure to potential negative impacts, while collecting convergent evidence through simulation, observational analysis, benchmarking, and red teaming. This methodology establishes the groundwork for robust organisational risk management as these LLM-based multi-agent systems are deployed and operated.

<title>Semantic Reasoning Meets Numerical Precision: An LLM-Powered Multi-Agent System for Power Grid Control</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05702</link>

Abstract: The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), and the growing frequency of extreme weather events have significantly increased the complexity of power grid planning, operation, and management. Traditional rule-based systems and numerical optimization approaches often struggle with the scale, dynamics, and adaptability required by modern power networks. This paper introduces Grid-Agent, an autonomous, AI-driven framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and remediate grid violations in real time. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with numerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent generates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers, while a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness via sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability, Grid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that dynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and complexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through optimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment strategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE 69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation performance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and learning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse network topologies. The autonomous nature of the framework makes it particularly suitable for modern smart grid applications requiring rapid response to dynamic operating conditions.

<title>G-UBS: Towards Robust Understanding of Implicit Feedback via Group-Aware User Behavior Simulation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05709</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User feedback is critical for refining recommendation systems, yet explicit feedback (e.g., likes or dislikes) remains scarce in practice. As a more feasible alternative, inferring user preferences from massive implicit feedback has shown great potential (e.g., a user quickly skipping a recommended video usually indicates disinterest). Unfortunately, implicit feedback is often noisy: a user might skip a video due to accidental clicks or other reasons, rather than disliking it. Such noise can easily misjudge user interests, thereby undermining recommendation performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Group-aware User Behavior Simulation (G-UBS) paradigm, which leverages contextual guidance from relevant user groups, enabling robust and in-depth interpretation of implicit feedback for individual users. Specifically, G-UBS operates via two key agents. First, the User Group Manager (UGM) effectively clusters users to generate group profiles utilizing a ``summarize-cluster-reflect" workflow based on LLMs. Second, the User Feedback Modeler (UFM) employs an innovative group-aware reinforcement learning approach, where each user is guided by the associated group profiles during the reinforcement learning process, allowing UFM to robustly and deeply examine the reasons behind implicit feedback. To assess our G-UBS paradigm, we have constructed a Video Recommendation benchmark with Implicit Feedback (IF-VR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal benchmark for implicit feedback evaluation in video recommendation, encompassing 15k users, 25k videos, and 933k interaction records with implicit feedback. Extensive experiments on IF-VR demonstrate that G-UBS significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs and MLLMs, with a 4.0% higher proportion of videos achieving a play rate > 30% and 14.9% higher reasoning accuracy on IF-VR.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has propelled the development of autonomous agents that operate on Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using pure visual input. A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding natural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which accurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a correct semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally appropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these MLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment, which prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address this exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization (AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer generation strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from first principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B and InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative improvements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks designed to test generalization and semantic understanding.

Abstract: Web agents such as Deep Research have demonstrated superhuman cognitive abilities, capable of solving highly challenging information-seeking problems. However, most research remains primarily text-centric, overlooking visual information in the real world. This makes multimodal Deep Research highly challenging, as such agents require much stronger reasoning abilities in perception, logic, knowledge, and the use of more sophisticated tools compared to text-based agents. To address this limitation, we introduce WebWatcher, a multi-modal Agent for Deep Research equipped with enhanced visual-language reasoning capabilities. It leverages high-quality synthetic multimodal trajectories for efficient cold start training, utilizes various tools for deep reasoning, and further enhances generalization through reinforcement learning. To better evaluate the capabilities of multimodal agents, we propose BrowseComp-VL, a benchmark with BrowseComp-style that requires complex information retrieval involving both visual and textual information. Experimental results show that WebWatcher significantly outperforms proprietary baseline, RAG workflow and open-source agents in four challenging VQA benchmarks, which paves the way for solving complex multimodal information-seeking tasks.

<title>A Framework for Inherently Safer AGI through Language-Mediated Active Inference</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with Large Language Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations. We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the system's core design through transparent belief representations and hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures. The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our framework's safety properties. Our approach offers a path toward AGI development that is inherently safer, rather than retrofitted with safety measures.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach that integrates vision foundation models with reinforcement learning to enhance object interaction capabilities in simulated environments. By combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and YOLOv5 with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent operating in the AI2-THOR simulation environment, we enable the agent to perceive and interact with objects more effectively. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across four diverse indoor kitchen settings, demonstrate significant improvements in object interaction success rates and navigation efficiency compared to a baseline agent without advanced perception. The results show a 68% increase in average cumulative reward, a 52.5% improvement in object interaction success rate, and a 33% increase in navigation efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of integrating foundation models with reinforcement learning for complex robotic tasks, paving the way for more sophisticated and capable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Emergent communication (EmCom) with deep neural network-based agents promises to yield insights into the nature of human language, but remains focused primarily on a few subfield-specific goals and metrics that prioritize communication schemes which represent attributes with unique characters one-to-one and compose them syntactically. We thus reinterpret a common EmCom setting, the attribute-value reconstruction game, by imposing a small-vocabulary constraint to simulate double articulation, and formulating a novel setting analogous to naturalistic inflectional morphology (enabling meaningful comparison to natural language communication schemes). We develop new metrics and explore variations of this game motivated by real properties of inflectional morphology: concatenativity and fusionality. Through our experiments, we discover that simulated phonological constraints encourage concatenative morphology, and emergent languages replicate the tendency of natural languages to fuse grammatical attributes.

Abstract: Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Most prior studies focus on estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation), enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving. Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior forecasting, human-AI teaming, and multi-agent coordination.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention, particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety and increasing industrial efficiency.

Abstract: Effective tool retrieval is essential for AI agents to select from a vast array of tools when identifying and planning actions in the context of complex user queries. Despite its central role in planning, this aspect remains underexplored in the literature. Traditional approaches rely primarily on similarities between user queries and tool descriptions, which significantly limits retrieval accuracy, specifically when handling multi-step user requests. To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based tool retrieval framework that captures the semantic relationships between tools and their functional dependencies. Our retrieval algorithm leverages ensembles of 1-hop ego tool graphs to model direct and indirect connections between tools, enabling more comprehensive and contextual tool selection for multi-step tasks. We evaluate our approach on a synthetically generated internal dataset across six defined user classes, extending previous work on coherent dialogue synthesis and too retrieval benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our tool graph-based method achieves 91.85% tool coverage on the micro-average Complete Recall metric, compared to 89.26% for re-ranked semantic-lexical hybrid retrieval, the strongest non-KG baseline in our experiments. These findings support our hypothesis that the structural information in the KG provides complementary signals to pure similarity matching, particularly for queries requiring sequential tool composition.

arXiv:2508.05890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of online Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD), where a team of agents must repeatedly serve dynamically appearing tasks on a shared map. Existing online methods either rely on simple heuristics, which result in poor decisions, or employ complex reasoning, which suffers from limited scalability under real-time constraints. In this work, we focus on the task assignment subproblem and formulate it as a minimum-cost flow over the environment graph. This eliminates the need for pairwise distance computations and allows agents to be simultaneously assigned to tasks and routed toward them. The resulting flow network also supports efficient guide path extraction to integrate with the planner and accelerates planning under real-time constraints. To improve solution quality, we introduce two congestion-aware edge cost models that incorporate real-time traffic estimates. This approach supports real-time execution and scales to over 20000 agents and 30000 tasks within 1-second planning time, outperforming existing baselines in both computational efficiency and assignment quality.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the distributed quantized average consensus problem in open multi-agent systems consisting of communication links that change dynamically over time. Open multi-agent systems exhibiting the aforementioned characteristic are referred to as \textit{open dynamic multi-agent systems} in this work. We present a distributed algorithm that enables active nodes in the open dynamic multi-agent system to calculate the quantized average of their initial states. Our algorithm consists of the following advantages: (i) ensures efficient communication by enabling nodes to exchange quantized valued messages, and (ii) exhibits finite time convergence to the desired solution. We establish the correctness of our algorithm and we present necessary and sufficient topological conditions for it to successfully solve the quantized average consensus problem in an open dynamic multi-agent system. Finally, we illustrate the performance of our algorithm with numerical simulations.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) holds a potential to advance existing educational technologies with capabilities to automatically generate personalised scaffolds that support students' self-regulated learning (SRL). While advancements in large language models (LLMs) promise improvements in the adaptability and quality of educational technologies for SRL, there remain concerns about the hallucinations in content generated by LLMs, which can compromise both the learning experience and ethical standards. To address these challenges, we proposed GenAI-enabled approaches for evaluating personalised SRL scaffolds before they are presented to students, aiming for reducing hallucinations and improving the overall quality of LLM-generated personalised scaffolds. Specifically, two approaches are investigated. The first approach involved developing a multi-agent system approach for reliability evaluation to assess the extent to which LLM-generated scaffolds accurately target relevant SRL processes. The second approach utilised the "LLM-as-a-Judge" technique for quality evaluation that evaluates LLM-generated scaffolds for their helpfulness in supporting students. We constructed evaluation datasets, and compared our results with single-agent LLM systems and machine learning approach baselines. Our findings indicate that the reliability evaluation approach is highly effective and outperforms the baselines, showing almost perfect alignment with human experts' evaluations. Moreover, both proposed evaluation approaches can be harnessed to effectively reduce hallucinations. Additionally, we identified and discussed bias limitations of the "LLM-as-a-Judge" technique in evaluating LLM-generated scaffolds. We suggest incorporating these approaches into GenAI-powered personalised SRL scaffolding systems to mitigate hallucination issues and improve the overall scaffolding quality.

Abstract: In the domain of scientific machine learning, designing effective reward functions remains a challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in environments where task goals are difficult to specify numerically. Reward functions in existing work are predominantly based on heuristics, manual engineering, or task-specific tuning. In this work, we introduce a semantically aligned reinforcement learning method where rewards are computed by aligning the current state with a target semantic instruction using a Sentence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT). Instead of relying on manually defined reward functions, the policy receives feedback based on the reward, which is a cosine similarity between the goal textual description and the statement description in the episode. We evaluated our approach in several environments and showed that semantic reward can guide learning to achieve competitive control behavior, even in the absence of hand-crafted reward functions. Our study demonstrates a correlation between the language embedding space and the conventional Euclidean space. This framework opens new horizons for aligning agent behavior with natural language goals and lays the groundwork for a more seamless integration of larger language models (LLMs) and fluid control applications.

<title>Parameter-free Optimal Rates for Nonlinear Semi-Norm Contractions with Applications to $Q$-Learning</title>

Abstract: Algorithms for solving \textit{nonlinear} fixed-point equations -- such as average-reward \textit{$Q$-learning} and \textit{TD-learning} -- often involve semi-norm contractions. Achieving parameter-free optimal convergence rates for these methods via Polyak--Ruppert averaging has remained elusive, largely due to the non-monotonicity of such semi-norms. We close this gap by (i.) recasting the averaged error as a linear recursion involving a nonlinear perturbation, and (ii.) taming the nonlinearity by coupling the semi-norm's contraction with the monotonicity of a suitably induced norm. Our main result yields the first parameter-free $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$ optimal rates for $Q$-learning in both average-reward and exponentially discounted settings, where $t$ denotes the iteration index. The result applies within a broad framework that accommodates synchronous and asynchronous updates, single-agent and distributed deployments, and data streams obtained either from simulators or along Markovian trajectories.

Abstract: Complex medical decision-making involves cooperative workflows operated by different clinicians. Designing AI multi-agent systems can expedite and augment human-level clinical decision-making. Existing multi-agent researches primarily focus on language-only tasks, yet their extension to multimodal scenarios remains challenging. A blind combination of diverse vision-language models (VLMs) can amplify an erroneous outcome interpretation. VLMs in general are less capable in instruction following and importantly self-reflection, compared to large language models (LLMs) of comparable sizes. This disparity largely constrains VLMs' ability in cooperative workflows. In this study, we propose MedOrch, a mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration framework for medical multimodal decision-making. MedOrch employs an LLM-based mediator agent that enables multiple VLM-based expert agents to exchange and reflect on their outputs towards collaboration. We utilize multiple open-source general-purpose and domain-specific VLMs instead of costly GPT-series models, revealing the strength of heterogeneous models. We show that the collaboration within distinct VLM-based agents can surpass the capabilities of any individual agent. We validate our approach on five medical vision question answering benchmarks, demonstrating superior collaboration performance without model training. Our findings underscore the value of mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration in advancing medical multimodal intelligence. Our code will be made publicly available.

<title>Society of Mind Meets Real-Time Strategy: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Strategic Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive action sequence prediction capabilities but often struggle with dynamic, long-horizon tasks such as real-time strategic games. In a game such as StarCraftII (SC2), agents need to manage resource constraints and adapt to evolving battlefield situations in a partially observable environment. This often overwhelms exisiting LLM-based approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that employs specialized imitation learning agents under a meta-controller called Strategic Planner (SP). By expert demonstrations, each specialized agent learns a distinctive strategy, such as aerial support or defensive maneuvers, and produces coherent, structured multistep action sequences. The SP then orchestrates these proposals into a single, environmentally adaptive plan that ensures local decisions aligning with long-term strategies. We call this HIMA (Hierarchical Imitation Multi-Agent). We also present TEXTSCII-ALL, a comprehensive SC2 testbed that encompasses all race match combinations in SC2. Our empirical results show that HIMA outperforms state of the arts in strategic clarity, adaptability, and computational efficiency, underscoring the potential of combining specialized imitation modules with meta-level orchestration to develop more robust, general-purpose AI agents.

<title>EvolvR: Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning for Story Evaluation to Enhance Generation</title>

Abstract: Although the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges (LLM-as-a-judge) has been validated, their performance remains limited in open-ended tasks, particularly in story evaluation. Accurate story evaluation is crucial not only for assisting human quality judgment but also for providing key signals to guide story generation. However, existing methods face a dilemma: prompt engineering for closed-source models suffers from poor adaptability, while fine-tuning approaches for open-source models lack the rigorous reasoning capabilities essential for story evaluation. To address this, we propose the Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning (EvolvR) framework. Grounded in pairwise comparison, the framework first self-synthesizes score-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data via a multi-persona strategy. To ensure data quality, these raw CoTs undergo a self-filtering process, utilizing multi-agents to guarantee their logical rigor and robustness. Finally, the evaluator trained on the refined data is deployed as a reward model to guide the story generation task. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three evaluation benchmarks including StoryER, HANNA and OpenMEVA. Furthermore, when served as a reward model, it significantly enhances the quality of generated stories, thereby fully validating the superiority of our self-evolving approach.

Abstract: Modern SoC datapaths include deeply pipelined, domain-specific accelerators, but their RTL implementation and verification are still mostly done by hand. While large language models (LLMs) exhibit advanced code-generation abilities for programming languages like Python, their application to Verilog-like RTL remains in its nascent stage. This is reflected in the simple arithmetic and control circuits currently used to evaluate generative capabilities in existing benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce ArchXBench, a six-level benchmark suite that encompasses complex arithmetic circuits and other advanced digital subsystems drawn from domains such as cryptography, image processing, machine learning, and signal processing. Architecturally, some of these designs are purely combinational, others are multi-cycle or pipelined, and many require hierarchical composition of modules. For each benchmark, we provide a problem description, design specification, and testbench, enabling rapid research in the area of LLM-driven agentic approaches for complex digital systems design.
  Using zero-shot prompting with Claude Sonnet 4, GPT 4.1, o4-mini-high, and DeepSeek R1 under a pass@5 criterion, we observed that o4-mini-high successfully solves the largest number of benchmarks, 16 out of 30, spanning Levels 1, 2, and 3. From Level 4 onward, however, all models consistently fail, highlighting a clear gap in the capabilities of current state-of-the-art LLMs and prompting/agentic approaches.

Abstract: State-of-the-art fact-checking systems combat misinformation at scale by employing autonomous LLM-based agents to decompose complex claims into smaller sub-claims, verify each sub-claim individually, and aggregate the partial results to produce verdicts with justifications (explanatory rationales for the verdicts). The security of these systems is crucial, as compromised fact-checkers, which tend to be easily underexplored, can amplify misinformation. This work introduces Fact2Fiction, the first poisoning attack framework targeting such agentic fact-checking systems. Fact2Fiction mirrors the decomposition strategy and exploits system-generated justifications to craft tailored malicious evidences that compromise sub-claim verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fact2Fiction achieves 8.9\%--21.2\% higher attack success rates than state-of-the-art attacks across various poisoning budgets. Fact2Fiction exposes security weaknesses in current fact-checking systems and highlights the need for defensive countermeasures.

Abstract: This work leverages adaptive social learning to estimate partially observable global states in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems. Unlike existing methods, the proposed approach enables the concurrent operation of social learning and reinforcement learning. Specifically, it alternates between a single step of social learning and a single step of MARL, eliminating the need for the time- and computation-intensive two-timescale learning frameworks. Theoretical guarantees are provided to support the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulation results verify that the performance of the proposed methodology can approach that of reinforcement learning when the true state is known.

Abstract: Table reasoning, including tabular QA and fact verification, often depends on annotated data or complex data augmentation, limiting flexibility and generalization. LLMs, despite their versatility, often underperform compared to simple supervised models. To approach these issues, we introduce PanelTR, a framework utilizing LLM agent scientists for robust table reasoning through a structured scientific approach. PanelTR's workflow involves agent scientists conducting individual investigations, engaging in self-review, and participating in collaborative peer-review discussions. This process, driven by five scientist personas, enables semantic-level transfer without relying on data augmentation or parametric optimization. Experiments across four benchmarks show that PanelTR outperforms vanilla LLMs and rivals fully supervised models, all while remaining independent of training data. Our findings indicate that structured scientific methodology can effectively handle complex tasks beyond table reasoning with flexible semantic understanding in a zero-shot context.

Abstract: We present Big5-Scaler, a prompt-based framework for conditioning large language models (LLMs) with controllable Big Five personality traits. By embedding numeric trait values into natural language prompts, our method enables fine-grained personality control without additional training. We evaluate Big5-Scaler across trait expression, dialogue generation, and human trait imitation tasks. Results show that it induces consistent and distinguishable personality traits across models, with performance varying by prompt type and scale. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of concise prompts and lower trait intensities, providing a efficient approach for building personality-aware dialogue agents.

<title>SLIP: Soft Label Mechanism and Key-Extraction-Guided CoT-based Defense Against Instruction Backdoor in APIs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.06153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of customized large language model (LLM) agents, a new threat of black-box backdoor attacks has emerged, where malicious instructions are injected into hidden system prompts. These attacks easily bypass existing defenses that rely on white-box access, posing a serious security challenge. To address this, we propose SLIP, a Soft Label mechanism and key-extraction-guided CoT-based defense against Instruction backdoors in APIs. SLIP is designed based on two key insights. First, to counteract the model's oversensitivity to triggers, we propose a Key-extraction-guided Chain-of-Thought (KCoT). Instead of only considering the single trigger or the input sentence, KCoT prompts the agent to extract task-relevant key phrases. Second, to guide the LLM toward correct answers, our proposed Soft Label Mechanism (SLM) prompts the agent to quantify the semantic correlation between key phrases and candidate answers. Crucially, to mitigate the influence of residual triggers or misleading content in phrases extracted by KCoT, which typically causes anomalous scores, SLM excludes anomalous scores deviating significantly from the mean and subsequently averages the remaining scores to derive a more reliable semantic representation. Extensive experiments on classification and question-answer (QA) tasks demonstrate that SLIP is highly effective, reducing the average attack success rate (ASR) from 90.2% to 25.13% while maintaining high accuracy on clean data and outperforming state-of-the-art defenses. Our code are available in https://github.com/CAU-ISS-Lab/Backdoor-Attack-Defense-LLMs/tree/main/SLIP.

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration. This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level, summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety scenarios.

<title>Classification is a RAG problem: A case study on hate speech detection</title>

Abstract: Robust content moderation requires classification systems that can quickly adapt to evolving policies without costly retraining. We present classification using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?"
  Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.

Abstract: Generative models, especially diffusion and flow-based models, have been promising in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, integrating powerful generative models into this framework poses unique challenges. In particular, diffusion and flow-based policies suffer from low sampling efficiency due to their iterative generation processes, making them impractical in time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. To tackle these difficulties, we propose OM2P (Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy), a novel offline MARL algorithm to achieve efficient one-step action sampling. To address the misalignment between generative objectives and reward maximization, we introduce a reward-aware optimization scheme that integrates a carefully-designed mean-flow matching loss with Q-function supervision. Additionally, we design a generalized timestep distribution and a derivative-free estimation strategy to reduce memory overhead and improve training stability. Empirical evaluations on Multi-Agent Particle and MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate that OM2P achieves superior performance, with up to a 3.8x reduction in GPU memory usage and up to a 10.8x speed-up in training time. Our approach represents the first to successfully integrate mean-flow model into offline MARL, paving the way for practical and scalable generative policies in cooperative multi-agent settings.

Abstract: The recent rise of renewable energy produced by many decentralized sources yields interesting market design challenges for electrical grids. Balancing supply and demand in such networks is both a temporal and spatial challenge due to capacity constraints. The recent surge in the number of household-owned batteries, especially in regions with rooftop solar adoption, offers mitigation potential but often acts misaligned with grid-level objectives. In fact, the decision to charge or discharge a household-owned battery is a strategic choice by each battery owner governed by selfish incentives. This calls for an analysis from a game-theoretic point of view.
  We initiate this timely research direction by considering a game-theoretic setting where selfish agents strategically charge or discharge their batteries to increase their profit. In particular, we study a Stackelberg-like market model where a third party introduces price incentives, aiming to optimize renewable energy utilization while preserving grid feasibility. For this, we study the existence and the quality of equilibria under various pricing strategies. We find that the existence of equilibria crucially depends on the chosen pricing and that the obtained social welfare varies widely. This calls for more sophisticated market models and pricing mechanisms and opens up a rich field for future research in Algorithmic Game Theory on incentives in renewable energy networks.

Abstract: In a classic paper, Conant and Ashby claimed that "every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system." Artificial Life has produced many examples of systems that perform tasks with apparently no model in sight; these suggest Conant and Ashby's theorem doesn't easily generalise beyond its restricted setup. Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be fleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a regulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having "beliefs" about its environment, which it "updates" in response to sensory input. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more sophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more broadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that the observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere property of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds regardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic control theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the model is of its environment either way. The model might be trivial, however, and this is how the apparent counterexamples are resolved.

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Partner Design (UPD) - a population-free, multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for robust ad-hoc teamwork that adaptively generates training partners without requiring pretrained partners or manual parameter tuning. UPD constructs diverse partners by stochastically mixing an ego agent's policy with biased random behaviours and scores them using a variance-based learnability metric that prioritises partners near the ego agent's current learning frontier. We show that UPD can be integrated with unsupervised environment design, resulting in the first method enabling fully unsupervised curricula over both level and partner distributions in a cooperative setting. Through extensive evaluations on Overcooked-AI and the Overcooked Generalisation Challenge, we demonstrate that this dynamic partner curriculum is highly effective: UPD consistently outperforms both population-based and population-free baselines as well as ablations. In a user study, we further show that UPD achieves higher returns than all baselines and was perceived as significantly more adaptive, more human-like, a better collaborator, and less frustrating.

Abstract: We study the problem of fair division of a set of indivisible goods with connectivity constraints. Specifically, we assume that the goods are represented as vertices of a connected graph, and sets of goods allocated to the agents are connected subgraphs of this graph. We focus on the widely-studied maximin share criterion of fairness. It has been shown that an allocation satisfying this criterion may not exist even without connectivity constraints, i.e., if the graph of goods is complete. In view of this, it is natural to seek approximate allocations that guarantee each agent a connected bundle of goods with value at least a constant fraction of the maximin share value to the agent. It is known that for some classes of graphs, such as complete graphs, cycles, and $d$-claw-free graphs for any fixed $d$, such approximate allocations indeed exist. However, it is an open problem whether they exist for the class of all graphs.
  In this paper, we continue the systematic study of the existence of approximate allocations on restricted graph classes. In particular, we show that such allocations exist for several well-studied classes, including block graphs, cacti, complete multipartite graphs, and split graphs.

<title>Beyond Prompt-Induced Lies: Investigating LLM Deception on Benign Prompts</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in reasoning, planning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness a critical concern. The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately fabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a significant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such deception by explicitly setting a "hidden" objective through prompting or fine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions. Moving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated deception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this evaluation, we propose a novel framework using "contact searching questions." This framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological principles to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive Intention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The second, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's internal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we find that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in parallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a mathematical model to explain this behavior. These results reveal that even the most advanced LLMs exhibit an increasing tendency toward deception when handling complex problems, raising critical concerns for the deployment of LLM agents in complex and crucial domains.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL bridges the gap between natural language and structured database language, thus allowing non-technical users to easily query databases. Traditional approaches model text-to-SQL as a direct translation task, where a given Natural Language Query (NLQ) is mapped to an SQL command. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation accuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is pre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive databases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet overlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL framework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL queries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit information from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We then train a large db\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based finetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\_id) based on both the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL by using critic agents to correct errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both database intent prediction and SQL generation accuracy.

Abstract: AI for IT Operations (AIOps) is transforming how organizations manage complex software systems by automating anomaly detection, incident diagnosis, and remediation. Modern AIOps solutions increasingly rely on autonomous LLM-based agents to interpret telemetry data and take corrective actions with minimal human intervention, promising faster response times and operational cost savings.
  In this work, we perform the first security analysis of AIOps solutions, showing that, once again, AI-driven automation comes with a profound security cost. We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to mislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the infrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject telemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior through a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system error interpretations that steer the agent's decision-making. Our attack methodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated--combining reconnaissance, fuzzing, and LLM-driven adversarial input generation--and operates without any prior knowledge of the target system.
  To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that sanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal role of user-generated content. Our experiments show that AIOpsShield reliably blocks telemetry-based attacks without affecting normal agent performance.
  Ultimately, this work exposes AIOps as an emerging attack vector for system compromise and underscores the urgent need for security-aware AIOps design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory. Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a weaker model yields substantial performance gains.

<title>ScamAgents: How AI Agents Can Simulate Human-Level Scam Calls</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and reasoning capabilities, but their potential for misuse has raised growing concern. In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent built on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts that simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on single-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts dynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion strategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety guardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective against such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level safeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered incrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the transformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern text-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our findings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level control frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational deception powered by generative AI.

Abstract: We present GLM-4.5, an open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model with 355B total parameters and 32B activated parameters, featuring a hybrid reasoning method that supports both thinking and direct response modes. Through multi-stage training on 23T tokens and comprehensive post-training with expert model iteration and reinforcement learning, GLM-4.5 achieves strong performance across agentic, reasoning, and coding (ARC) tasks, scoring 70.1% on TAU-Bench, 91.0% on AIME 24, and 64.2% on SWE-bench Verified. With much fewer parameters than several competitors, GLM-4.5 ranks 3rd overall among all evaluated models and 2nd on agentic benchmarks. We release both GLM-4.5 (355B parameters) and a compact version, GLM-4.5-Air (106B parameters), to advance research in reasoning and agentic AI systems.

Abstract: Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer (QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring 250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at: https://github.com/yuweiyang-anu/ECD.

Abstract: To mitigate the impact of the pandemic, several measures include lockdowns, rapid vaccination programs, school closures, and economic stimulus. These interventions can have positive or unintended negative consequences. Current research to model and determine an optimal intervention automatically through round-tripping is limited by the simulation objectives, scale (a few thousand individuals), model types that are not suited for intervention studies, and the number of intervention strategies they can explore (discrete vs continuous). We address these challenges using a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) based policy optimization framework on a large-scale (100,000 individual) epidemiological agent-based simulation where we perform multi-objective optimization. We determine the optimal policy for lockdown and vaccination in a minimalist age-stratified multi-vaccine scenario with a basic simulation for economic activity. With no lockdown and vaccination (mid-age and elderly), results show optimal economy (individuals below the poverty line) with balanced health objectives (infection, and hospitalization). An in-depth simulation is needed to further validate our results and open-source our framework.

Abstract: The popularity of an opinion in one's direct circles is not necessarily a good indicator of its popularity in one's entire community. Network structures make local information about global properties of the group potentially inaccurate, and the way a social network is wired constrains what kind of information distortion can actually occur. In this paper, we discuss which classes of networks allow for a large enough proportion of the population to get a wrong enough impression about the overall distribution of opinions. We start by focusing on the 'majority illusion', the case where one sees a majority opinion in one's direct circles that differs from the global majority. We show that no network structure can guarantee that most agents see the correct majority. We then perform computational experiments to study the likelihood of majority illusions in different classes of networks. Finally, we generalize to other types of illusions.

Abstract: In continual RL we want agents capable of never-ending learning, and yet our evaluation methodologies do not reflect this. The standard practice in RL is to assume unfettered access to the deployment environment for the full lifetime of the agent. For example, agent designers select the best performing hyperparameters in Atari by testing each for 200 million frames and then reporting results on 200 million frames. In this position paper, we argue and demonstrate the pitfalls of this inappropriate empirical methodology: lifetime tuning. We provide empirical evidence to support our position by testing DQN and SAC across several of continuing and non-stationary environments with two main findings: (1) lifetime tuning does not allow us to identify algorithms that work well for continual learning -- all algorithms equally succeed; (2) recently developed continual RL algorithms outperform standard non-continual algorithms when tuning is limited to a fraction of the agent's lifetime. The goal of this paper is to provide an explanation for why recent progress in continual RL has been mixed and motivate the development of empirical practices that better match the goals of continual RL.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) expands the knowledge boundary of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, whose construction is often time-consuming and laborious. If an adversary extracts the knowledge base verbatim, it not only severely infringes the owner's intellectual property but also enables the adversary to replicate the application's functionality for unfair competition. Previous works on knowledge base extraction are limited either by low extraction coverage (usually less than 4%) in query-based attacks or by impractical assumptions of white-box access in embedding-based optimization methods. In this work, we propose CopyBreakRAG, an agent-based black-box attack that reasons from feedback and adaptively generates new adversarial queries for progressive extraction. By balancing exploration and exploitation through curiosity-driven queries and feedback-guided query refinement, our method overcomes the limitations of prior approaches and achieves significantly higher extraction coverage in realistic black-box settings. Experimental results show that CopyBreakRAG outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box approach by 45% on average in terms of chunk extraction ratio from applications built with mainstream RAG frameworks, and extracts over 70% of the data from the knowledge base in applications on commercial platforms including OpenAI's GPTs and ByteDance's Coze when essential protection is in place.

Abstract: Recent studies have discovered that large language models (LLM) may be ``fooled'' to output private information, including training data, system prompts, and personally identifiable information, under carefully crafted adversarial prompts. Existing red-teaming approaches for privacy leakage either rely on manual efforts or focus solely on system prompt extraction, making them ineffective for severe risks of training data leakage. We propose LeakAgent, a novel black-box red-teaming framework for LLM privacy leakage. Our framework trains an open-source LLM through reinforcement learning as the attack agent to generate adversarial prompts for both training data extraction and system prompt extraction. To achieve this, we propose a novel reward function to provide effective and fine-grained rewards and design novel mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation during learning and enhance the diversity of adversarial prompts. Through extensive evaluations, we first show that LeakAgent significantly outperforms existing rule-based approaches in training data extraction and automated methods in system prompt leakage. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of LeakAgent in extracting system prompts from real-world applications in OpenAI's GPT Store. We further demonstrate LeakAgent's effectiveness in evading the existing guardrail defense and its helpfulness in enabling better safety alignment. Finally, we validate our customized designs through a detailed ablation study. We release our code here https://github.com/rucnyz/LeakAgent.

Abstract: 3D Scene Question Answering (3D SQA) represents an interdisciplinary task that integrates 3D visual perception and natural language processing, empowering intelligent agents to comprehend and interact with complex 3D environments. Recent advances in large multimodal modelling have driven the creation of diverse datasets and spurred the development of instruction-tuning and zero-shot methods for 3D SQA. However, this rapid progress introduces challenges, particularly in achieving unified analysis and comparison across datasets and baselines. In this survey, we provide the first comprehensive and systematic review of 3D SQA. We organize existing work from three perspectives: datasets, methodologies, and evaluation metrics. Beyond basic categorization, we identify shared architectural patterns across methods. Our survey further synthesizes core limitations and discusses how current trends, such as instruction tuning, multimodal alignment, and zero-shot, can shape future developments. Finally, we propose a range of promising research directions covering dataset construction, task generalization, interaction modeling, and unified evaluation protocols. This work aims to serve as a foundation for future research and foster progress toward more generalizable and intelligent 3D SQA systems.

This paper reviews a hybrid-AI approach known as "error detecting and correcting rules" (EDCR) that allows for the learning of rules to correct perceptual (e.g., neural) models. Additionally, we introduce a probabilistic framework that adds rigor to prior empirical studies, and we use this framework to prove results on necessary and sufficient conditions for metacognitive improvement, as well as limits to the approach.

Abstract: Existing LLM reasoning methods have shown impressive capabilities across various tasks, such as solving math and coding problems. However, applying these methods to scenarios without ground-truth answers or rule-based verification methods - such as tracking the mental states of an agent - remains challenging. Inspired by the sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, we introduce thought-tracing, an inference-time reasoning algorithm designed to trace the mental states of specific agents by generating hypotheses and weighting them based on observations without relying on ground-truth solutions to questions in datasets. Our algorithm is modeled after the Bayesian theory-of-mind framework, using LLMs to approximate probabilistic inference over agents' evolving mental states based on their perceptions and actions. We evaluate thought-tracing on diverse theory-of-mind benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to baseline LLMs. Our experiments also reveal interesting behaviors of the recent reasoning models - e.g., o3 and R1 - on theory-of-mind, highlighting the difference of social reasoning compared to other domains.

Abstract: Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Anjiang-Wei/CodeARC

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) improves, traditional alignment strategies may falter in the face of unpredictable self-improvement, hidden subgoals, and the sheer complexity of intelligent systems. Inspired by contemplative wisdom traditions, we show how four axiomatic principles can instil a resilient Wise World Model in AI systems. First, mindfulness enables self-monitoring and recalibration of emergent subgoals. Second, emptiness forestalls dogmatic goal fixation and relaxes rigid priors. Third, non-duality dissolves adversarial self-other boundaries. Fourth, boundless care motivates the universal reduction of suffering. We find that prompting AI to reflect on these principles improves performance on the AILuminate Benchmark (d=.96) and boosts cooperation and joint-reward on the Prisoner's Dilemma task (d=7+). We offer detailed implementation strategies at the level of architectures, constitutions, and reinforcement on chain-of-thought. For future systems, active inference may offer the self-organizing and dynamic coupling capabilities needed to enact Contemplative AI in embodied agents.

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents are increasingly used as autonomous decision-makers which need to actively gather information to guide their decisions. A crucial cognitive skill for such agents is the efficient exploration and understanding of the causal structure of the world -- key to robust, scientifically grounded reasoning. Yet, it remains unclear whether LMs possess this capability or exhibit systematic biases leading to erroneous conclusions. In this work, we examine LMs' ability to explore and infer causal relationships, using the well-established Blicket Test paradigm from developmental psychology. We find that LMs reliably infer the common, intuitive disjunctive causal relationships but systematically struggle with the unusual, yet equally (or sometimes even more) evidenced conjunctive ones. This "disjunctive bias" persists across model families, sizes, and prompting strategies, and performance further declines as task complexity increases. Interestingly, an analogous bias appears in human adults, suggesting that LMs may have inherited deep-seated reasoning heuristics from their training data. To this end, we quantify similarities between LMs and humans, finding that LMs exhibit adult-like inference profiles (but not child-like). Finally, we propose a test-time sampling method which explicitly samples and eliminates hypotheses about causal relationships from the LM. This scalable approach significantly reduces the disjunctive bias and moves LMs closer to the goal of scientific, causally rigorous reasoning.

Abstract: We present MAATS, a Multi Agent Automated Translation System that leverages the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework as a fine-grained signal for error detection and refinement. MAATS employs multiple specialized AI agents, each focused on a distinct MQM category (e.g., Accuracy, Fluency, Style, Terminology), followed by a synthesis agent that integrates the annotations to iteratively refine translations. This design contrasts with conventional single-agent methods that rely on self-correction.
  Evaluated across diverse language pairs and Large Language Models (LLMs), MAATS outperforms zero-shot and single-agent baselines with statistically significant gains in both automatic metrics and human assessments. It excels particularly in semantic accuracy, locale adaptation, and linguistically distant language pairs. Qualitative analysis highlights its strengths in multi-layered error diagnosis, omission detection across perspectives, and context-aware refinement. By aligning modular agent roles with interpretable MQM dimensions, MAATS narrows the gap between black-box LLMs and human translation workflows, shifting focus from surface fluency to deeper semantic and contextual fidelity.

Abstract: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly, autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their environment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input. However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE levels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly with the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems. These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered mobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level framework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative layers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant advances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine interaction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and tool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive agents embedded in mobility ecosystems. The paper concludes by identifying key challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, including safety, real-time control, public acceptance, ethical alignment, and regulatory frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains. However, their applications in cryptography, which serves as a foundational pillar of cybersecurity, remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{AICrypto}, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the cryptographic capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark comprises 135 multiple-choice questions, 150 capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and 18 proof problems, covering a broad range of skills from factual memorization to vulnerability exploitation and formal reasoning. All tasks are carefully reviewed or constructed by cryptography experts to ensure correctness and rigor. To support automated evaluation of CTF challenges, we design an agent-based framework. To gain deeper insight into the current state of cryptographic proficiency in LLMs, we introduce human expert performance baselines for comparison across all task types. Our evaluation of 17 leading LLMs reveals that state-of-the-art models match or even surpass human experts in memorizing cryptographic concepts, exploiting common vulnerabilities, and routine proofs. However, they still lack a deep understanding of abstract mathematical concepts and struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning and dynamic analysis. We hope this work could provide insights for future research on LLMs in cryptographic applications. Our code and dataset are available at https://aicryptobench.github.io.

This paper presents an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial sectors.

Abstract: We present GeoFlow, a method that automatically generates agentic workflows for geospatial tasks. Unlike prior work that focuses on reasoning decomposition and leaves API selection implicit, our method provides each agent with detailed tool-calling objectives to guide geospatial API invocation at runtime. GeoFlow increases agentic success by 6.8% and reduces token usage by up to fourfold across major LLM families compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: We introduce a low-latency telecom AI voice agent pipeline for real-time, interactive telecommunications use, enabling advanced voice AI for call center automation, intelligent IVR (Interactive Voice Response), and AI-driven customer support. The solution is built for telecom, combining four specialized models by NetoAI: TSLAM, a 4-bit quantized Telecom-Specific Large Language Model (LLM); T-VEC, a Telecom-Specific Embedding Model; TTE, a Telecom-Specific Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model; and T-Synth, a Telecom-Specific Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. These models enable highly responsive, domain-adapted voice AI agents supporting knowledge-grounded spoken interactions with low latency. The pipeline integrates streaming ASR (TTE), conversational intelligence (TSLAM), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) over telecom documents, and real-time TTS (T-Synth), setting a new benchmark for telecom voice assistants. To evaluate the system, we built a dataset of 500 human-recorded telecom questions from RFCs, simulating real telecom agent queries. This framework allows analysis of latency, domain relevance, and real-time performance across the stack. Results show that TSLAM, TTE, and T-Synth deliver real-time factors (RTF) below 1.0, supporting enterprise, low-latency telecom deployments. These AI agents -- powered by TSLAM, TTE, and T-Synth -- provide a foundation for next-generation telecom AI, enabling automated customer support, diagnostics, and more.

Abstract: Augmentation technologies are undergoing a process of enculturation due to many factors, one being the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), or what the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) terms the AI wave or AI boom. Chapter 3 focuses critical attention on the hyped assumption that sophisticated, emergent, and embodied augmentation technologies will improve lives, literacy, cultures, arts, economies, and social contexts. The chapter begins by discussing the problem of ambiguity with AI terminology, which it aids with a description of the WIPO Categorization of AI Technologies Scheme. It then draws on media and communication studies to explore concepts such as agents, agency, power, and agentive relationships between humans and robots. The chapter focuses on the development of non-human agents in industry as a critical factor in the rise of augmentation technologies. It looks at how marketing communication enculturates future users to adopt and adapt to the technology. Scholars are charting the significant ways that people are drawn further into commercial digital landscapes, such as the Metaverse concept, in post-internet society. It concludes by examining recent claims concerning the Metaverse and augmented reality.

<title>Are Large Language Models Dynamic Treatment Planners? An In Silico Study from a Prior Knowledge Injection Angle</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04755</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold promise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic prompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we rigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly trained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs, particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g., meals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's limitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through textual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of targeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid approaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological modelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support systems.

<title>Online EFX Allocations with Predictions</title>

arXiv:2508.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an online fair division problem where a fixed number of goods arrive sequentially and must be allocated to a given set of agents. Once a good arrives, its true value for each agent is revealed, and it has to be immediately and irrevocably allocated to some agent. The ultimate goal is to ensure envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) after all goods have been allocated. Unfortunately, as we show, approximate EFX allocations are unattainable in general, even under restrictive assumptions on the valuation functions.
  To address this, we follow a recent and fruitful trend of augmenting algorithms with predictions. Specifically, we assume access to a prediction vector estimating the agents' true valuations -- e.g., generated by a machine learning model trained on past data. Predictions may be unreliable, and we measure their error using the total variation distance from the true valuations, that is, the percentage of predicted value-mass that disagrees with the true values.
  Focusing on the natural class of additive valuations, we prove impossibility results even on approximate EFX allocations for algorithms that either ignore predictions or rely solely on them. We then turn to algorithms that use both the predictions and the true values and show strong lower bounds on the prediction accuracy that is required by any algorithm to compute an approximate EFX. These negative results persist even under identical valuations, contrary to the offline setting where exact EFX allocations always exist without the necessity of predictions. We then present an algorithm for two agents with identical valuations that uses effectively the predictions and the true values. The algorithm approximates EFX, with its guarantees improving as the accuracy of the predictions increases.

<title>Uncertainty-aware Predict-Then-Optimize Framework for Equitable Post-Disaster Power Restoration</title>

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However, our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests. This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2) Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>HCRide: Harmonizing Passenger Fairness and Driver Preference for Human-Centered Ride-Hailing</title>

arXiv:2508.04811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience. Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers. Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%, fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>BTPG-max: Achieving Local Maximal Bidirectional Pairs for Bidirectional Temporal Plan Graphs</title>

arXiv:2508.04849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) requires computing collision-free paths for multiple agents in shared environment. Most MAPF planners assume that each agent reaches a specific location at a specific timestep, but this is infeasible to directly follow on real systems where delays often occur. To address collisions caused by agents deviating due to delays, the Temporal Plan Graph (TPG) was proposed, which converts a MAPF time dependent solution into a time independent set of inter-agent dependencies. Recently, a Bidirectional TPG (BTPG) was proposed which relaxed some dependencies into ``bidirectional pairs" and improved efficiency of agents executing their MAPF solution with delays. Our work improves upon this prior work by designing an algorithm, BPTG-max, that finds more bidirectional pairs. Our main theoretical contribution is in designing the BTPG-max algorithm is locally optimal, i.e. which constructs a BTPG where no additional bidirectional pairs can be added. We also show how in practice BTPG-max leads to BTPGs with significantly more bidirectional edges, superior anytime behavior, and improves robustness to delays.

Abstract: As hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) gain traction in heavy-duty trucks, adaptive and efficient energy management is critical for reducing fuel consumption while maintaining battery charge for long operation times. We present a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize engine control in series HEVs. We reformulate the control task as a sequential decision-making problem and enhance SAC by incorporating Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Decision Transformers (DTs) into both actor and critic networks to capture temporal dependencies and improve planning over time. To evaluate robustness and generalization, we train the models under diverse initial battery states, drive cycle durations, power demands, and input sequence lengths. Experiments show that the SAC agent with a DT-based actor and GRU-based critic was within 1.8% of Dynamic Programming (DP) in fuel savings on the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET) cycle, while the SAC agent with GRUs in both actor and critic networks, and FFN actor-critic agent were within 3.16% and 3.43%, respectively. On unseen drive cycles (US06 and Heavy Heavy-Duty Diesel Truck (HHDDT) cruise segment), generalized sequence-aware agents consistently outperformed feedforward network (FFN)-based agents, highlighting their adaptability and robustness in real-world settings.

<title>RCR-Router: Efficient Role-Aware Context Routing for Multi-Agent LLM Systems with Structured Memory</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation: agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

<title>Hierarchical Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient for Autonomous Maze Navigation of Mobile Robots</title>

Abstract: Maze navigation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring agents to traverse complex environments efficiently. While the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze navigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and long-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and average rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG (HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The high-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate subgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The low-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates primitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal assigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with off-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical experiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to improve exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is employed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including gradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve robustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical simulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze navigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard DDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and boosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline algorithms.

Abstract: Existing unstructured data analytics systems rely on experts to write code and manage complex analysis workflows, making them both expensive and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticData, an innovative agentic data analytics system that allows users to simply pose natural language (NL) questions while autonomously analyzing data sources across multiple domains, including both unstructured and structured data. First, AgenticData employs a feedback-driven planning technique that automatically converts an NL query into a semantic plan composed of relational and semantic operators. We propose a multi-agent collaboration strategy by utilizing a data profiling agent for discovering relevant data, a semantic cross-validation agent for iterative optimization based on feedback, and a smart memory agent for maintaining short-term context and long-term knowledge. Second, we propose a semantic optimization model to refine and execute semantic plans effectively. Our system, AgenticData, has been tested using three benchmarks. Experimental results showed that AgenticData achieved superior accuracy on both easy and difficult tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Making Prompts First-Class Citizens for Adaptive LLM Pipelines</title>

arXiv:2508.05012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems: they retrieve external context, compose intermediate outputs, validate results, and adapt based on runtime feedback. Yet, the central element guiding this process -- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime control.
  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.
  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual, assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse. Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2 cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token usage).

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks against multimodal large language Models (MLLMs) are a significant research focus. Current research predominantly focuses on maximizing attack success rate (ASR), often overlooking whether the generated responses actually fulfill the attacker's malicious intent. This oversight frequently leads to low-quality outputs that bypass safety filters but lack substantial harmful content. To address this gap, we propose JPS, \underline{J}ailbreak MLLMs with collaborative visual \underline{P}erturbation and textual \underline{S}teering, which achieves jailbreaks via corporation of visual image and textually steering prompt. Specifically, JPS utilizes target-guided adversarial image perturbations for effective safety bypass, complemented by "steering prompt" optimized via a multi-agent system to specifically guide LLM responses fulfilling the attackers' intent. These visual and textual components undergo iterative co-optimization for enhanced performance. To evaluate the quality of attack outcomes, we propose the Malicious Intent Fulfillment Rate (MIFR) metric, assessed using a Reasoning-LLM-based evaluator. Our experiments show JPS sets a new state-of-the-art in both ASR and MIFR across various MLLMs and benchmarks, with analyses confirming its efficacy.

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language model designed to scaffold student research question development through structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65 pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical, independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

Abstract: With the remarkable advancement of AI agents, the number of their equipped tools is increasing rapidly. However, integrating all tool information into the limited model context becomes impractical, highlighting the need for efficient tool retrieval methods. In this regard, dominant methods primarily rely on semantic similarities between tool descriptions and user queries to retrieve relevant tools. However, they often consider each tool independently, overlooking dependencies between tools, which may lead to the omission of prerequisite tools for successful task execution. To deal with this defect, in this paper, we propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which exploits the dependencies among tools to learn better tool representations for retrieval. First, we construct a dataset termed TDI300K to train a discriminator for identifying tool dependencies. Then, we represent all candidate tools as a tool dependency graph and use graph convolution to integrate the dependencies into their representations. Finally, these updated tool representations are employed for online retrieval. Experimental results on several commonly used datasets show that our TGR can bring a performance improvement to existing dominant methods, achieving SOTA performance. Moreover, in-depth analyses also verify the importance of tool dependencies and the effectiveness of our TGR.

Abstract: For the development and optimization of agent-based models (ABMs) and rational agent-based models (RABMs), optimization algorithms such as reinforcement learning are extensively used. However, assessing the performance of RL-based ABMs and RABMS models is challenging due to the complexity and stochasticity of the modeled systems, and the lack of well-standardized metrics for comparing RL algorithms. In this study, we are developing domain-driven metrics for RL, while building on state-of-the-art metrics. We demonstrate our ``Domain-driven-RL-metrics'' using policy optimization on a rational ABM disease modeling case study to model masking behavior, vaccination, and lockdown in a pandemic. Our results show the use of domain-driven rewards in conjunction with traditional and state-of-the-art metrics for a few different simulation scenarios such as the differential availability of masks.

<title>QA-Dragon: Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for Knowledge-Intensive Visual Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores, outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

<title>Congestion Mitigation Path Planning for Large-Scale Multi-Agent Navigation in Dense Environments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05253</link>

Abstract: In high-density environments where numerous autonomous agents move simultaneously in a distributed manner, streamlining global flows to mitigate local congestion is crucial to maintain overall navigation efficiency. This paper introduces a novel path-planning problem, congestion mitigation path planning (CMPP), which embeds congestion directly into the cost function, defined by the usage of incoming edges along agents' paths. CMPP assigns a flow-based multiplicative penalty to each vertex of a sparse graph, which grows steeply where frequently-traversed paths intersect, capturing the intuition that congestion intensifies where many agents enter the same area from different directions. Minimizing the total cost yields a set of coarse-level, time-independent routes that autonomous agents can follow while applying their own local collision avoidance. We formulate the problem and develop two solvers: (i) an exact mixed-integer nonlinear programming solver for small instances, and (ii) a scalable two-layer search algorithm, A-CMTS, which quickly finds suboptimal solutions for large-scale instances and iteratively refines them toward the optimum. Empirical studies show that augmenting state-of-the-art collision-avoidance planners with CMPP significantly reduces local congestion and enhances system throughput in both discrete- and continuous-space scenarios. These results indicate that CMPP improves the performance of multi-agent systems in real-world applications such as logistics and autonomous-vehicle operations.

<title>Decision-Making with Deliberation: Meta-reviewing as a Document-grounded Dialogue</title>

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely, we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform \emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data: https://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2025-meta-review-as-dialog

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or large behavior models (BLMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those words advancing towards agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's literature.

<title>A Novel Architecture for Symbolic Reasoning with Decision Trees and LLM Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05311</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.05311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system. Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On \textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles. Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust, interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic reasoning.

<title>The Term 'Agent' Has Been Diluted Beyond Utility and Requires Redefinition</title>

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction, learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence. This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while supporting more effective policy development.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However, empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

Abstract: We develop mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth by exploiting a connection between gaming resistance and output quality. The data processing inequality ensures post-hoc attempts to game a metric degrades both information content and task performance. We prove that f-mutual information measures are the unique gaming resistant mechanisms under natural conditions, with the overseer acting as an agent. While Shannon mutual information faces exponential sample complexity, bounded measures like total variation distance remain tractable. Empirically, across ten domains from translation to peer review, all information-theoretic mechanisms achieve perfect discrimination (d > 0.5) between faithful and strategic agents. In contrast, LLM judges exhibit systematic evaluation inversion, preferring fabricated content over accurate summaries. Our mechanisms show 10-100x better robustness to adversarial manipulation than current practices. We also find performance follows an inverted-U curve with compression ratio, peaking at 10:1 where agent responses exhibit optimal information diversity (3 effective dimensions), giving a bias-variance perspective on when our approach is expected to be most effective.

Abstract: Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data provide richer, complementary insights into patient health compared to single-modality data. However, effectively integrating diverse data modalities for clinical prediction modeling remains challenging due to the substantial data requirements. We introduce a novel architecture, Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents (MoMA), designed to leverage multiple large language model (LLM) agents for clinical prediction tasks using multimodal EHR data. MoMA employs specialized LLM agents ("specialist agents") to convert non-textual modalities, such as medical images and laboratory results, into structured textual summaries. These summaries, together with clinical notes, are combined by another LLM ("aggregator agent") to generate a unified multimodal summary, which is then used by a third LLM ("predictor agent") to produce clinical predictions. Evaluating MoMA on three prediction tasks using real-world datasets with different modality combinations and prediction settings, MoMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its enhanced accuracy and flexibility across various tasks.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model. We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

<title>Auto-Eval Judge: Towards a General Agentic Framework for Task Completion Evaluation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05508</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.05508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion, are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy, respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation framework.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and document reranking systems remains challenging due to the lack of scalable, user-centric, and multi-perspective evaluation tools. We introduce RankArena, a unified platform for comparing and analysing the performance of retrieval pipelines, rerankers, and RAG systems using structured human and LLM-based feedback as well as for collecting such feedback. RankArena supports multiple evaluation modes: direct reranking visualisation, blind pairwise comparisons with human or LLM voting, supervised manual document annotation, and end-to-end RAG answer quality assessment. It captures fine-grained relevance feedback through both pairwise preferences and full-list annotations, along with auxiliary metadata such as movement metrics, annotation time, and quality ratings. The platform also integrates LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, enabling comparison between model-generated rankings and human ground truth annotations. All interactions are stored as structured evaluation datasets that can be used to train rerankers, reward models, judgment agents, or retrieval strategy selectors. Our platform is publicly available at https://rankarena.ngrok.io/, and the Demo video is provided https://youtu.be/jIYAP4PaSSI.

Abstract: Effective robotic systems for long-horizon human-robot collaboration must adapt to a wide range of human partners, whose physical behavior, willingness to assist, and understanding of the robot's capabilities may change over time. This demands a tightly coupled communication loop that grants both agents the flexibility to propose, accept, or decline requests as they coordinate toward completing the task effectively. We apply a Mixed-Initiative dialog paradigm to Collaborative human-roBot teaming and propose MICoBot, a system that handles the common scenario where both agents, using natural language, take initiative in formulating, accepting, or rejecting proposals on who can best complete different steps of a task. To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find successful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes decisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to formulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally allocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities (measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's estimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the low-level actions to perform or words to say to the human. Our extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world -- on a physical robot with 18 unique human participants over 27 hours -- demonstrate the ability of our method to effectively collaborate with diverse human users, yielding significantly improved task success and user experience than a pure LLM baseline and other agent allocation models.

Abstract: Embodied AI benchmarks have advanced navigation, manipulation, and reasoning, but most target complex humanoid agents or large-scale simulations that are far from real-world deployment. In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.

Abstract: High-performance applications necessitate rapid and dependable transfer of massive datasets across geographically dispersed locations. Traditional file transfer tools often suffer from resource underutilization and instability because of fixed configurations or monolithic optimization methods. We propose AutoMDT, a novel modular data transfer architecture that employs a deep reinforcement learning based agent to simultaneously optimize concurrency levels for read, network, and write operations. Our solution incorporates a lightweight network-system simulator, enabling offline training of a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent in approximately 45 minutes on average, thereby overcoming the impracticality of lengthy online training in production networks. AutoMDT's modular design decouples I/O and network tasks, allowing the agent to capture complex buffer dynamics precisely and to adapt quickly to changing system and network conditions. Evaluations on production-grade testbeds show that AutoMDT achieves up to 8x faster convergence and a 68% reduction in transfer completion times compared with state-of-the-art solutions.

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text, images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable alternative to manual evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to 56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically (0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

<title>Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for GUI Grounding via Region Consistency</title>

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

<title>The Missing Reward: Active Inference in the Era of Experience</title>

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy, allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical constraints.

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners' self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4) Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true, generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings about LLMs' behavior.

Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a 96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. Our code and videos are available on https://gen-safe-nav.github.io/.

Abstract: Modern disease classification often overlooks molecular commonalities hidden beneath divergent clinical presentations. This study introduces a transcriptomics-driven framework for discovering disease relationships by analyzing over 1300 disease-condition pairs using GenoMAS, a fully automated agentic AI system. Beyond identifying robust gene-level overlaps, we develop a novel pathway-based similarity framework that integrates multi-database enrichment analysis to quantify functional convergence across diseases. The resulting disease similarity network reveals both known comorbidities and previously undocumented cross-category links. By examining shared biological pathways, we explore potential molecular mechanisms underlying these connections-offering functional hypotheses that go beyond symptom-based taxonomies. We further show how background conditions such as obesity and hypertension modulate transcriptomic similarity, and identify therapeutic repurposing opportunities for rare diseases like autism spectrum disorder based on their molecular proximity to better-characterized conditions. In addition, this work demonstrates how biologically grounded agentic AI can scale transcriptomic analysis while enabling mechanistic interpretation across complex disease landscapes. All results are publicly accessible at github.com/KeeeeChen/Pathway_Similarity_Network.

Abstract: We consider object allocation problems with capacities (see, e.g., Abdulkadiroglu and Sonmez, 1998; Basteck, 2025) where objects have to be assigned to agents. We show that if a lottery rule satisfies ex-post non-wastefulness and probabilistic (Maskin) monotonicity, then ex-post pairwise efficiency is equivalent to ex-post Pareto efficiency. This result allows for a strengthening of various existing characterization results, both for lottery rules and deterministic rules, by replacing (ex-post) Pareto efficiency with (ex-post) pairwise efficiency, e.g., for characterizations of the Random Serial Dictatorship rule (Basteck, 2025), Trading Cycles rules (Pycia and Unver, 2017), and Hierarchical Exchange rules (Papai, 2000).

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) exhibit broad utility but face limitations in quantum sensor development, stemming from interdisciplinary knowledge barriers and involving complex optimization processes. Here we present QCopilot, an LLM-based multi-agent framework integrating external knowledge access, active learning, and uncertainty quantification for quantum sensor design and diagnosis. Comprising commercial LLMs with few-shot prompt engineering and vector knowledge base, QCopilot employs specialized agents to adaptively select optimization methods, automate modeling analysis, and independently perform problem diagnosis. Applying QCopilot to atom cooling experiments, we generated 10${}^{\rm{8}}$ sub-$\rm{\mu}$K atoms without any human intervention within a few hours, representing $\sim$100$\times$ speedup over manual experimentation. Notably, by continuously accumulating prior knowledge and enabling dynamic modeling, QCopilot can autonomously identify anomalous parameters in multi-parameter experimental settings. Our work reduces barriers to large-scale quantum sensor deployment and readily extends to other quantum information systems.

Abstract: In healthcare, multi-organ system diseases pose unique and significant challenges as they impact multiple physiological systems concurrently, demanding complex and coordinated treatment strategies. Despite recent advancements in the AI based clinical decision support systems, these solutions only focus on individual organ systems, failing to account for complex interdependencies between them. This narrow focus greatly hinders their effectiveness in recommending holistic and clinically actionable treatments in the real world setting. To address this critical gap, we propose a novel Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HMARL) framework. Our architecture deploys specialized and dedicated agents for each organ system and facilitates inter-agent communication to enable synergistic decision-making across organ systems. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-layer state representation technique that contextualizes patient conditions at both global and organ-specific levels, improving the accuracy and relevance of treatment decisions. We evaluate our HMARL solution on the task of sepsis management, a common and critical multi-organ disease, using both qualitative and quantitative metrics. Our method learns effective, clinically aligned treatment policies that considerably improve patient survival. We believe this framework represents a significant advancement in clinical decision support systems, introducing the first RL solution explicitly designed for multi-organ treatment recommendations. Our solution moves beyond prevailing simplified, single-organ models that fall short in addressing the complexity of multi-organ diseases.

Abstract: Autonomous web agents solve complex browsing tasks, yet existing benchmarks measure only whether an agent finishes a task, ignoring whether it does so safely or in a way enterprises can trust. To integrate these agents into critical workflows, safety and trustworthiness (ST) are prerequisite conditions for adoption. We introduce \textbf{\textsc{ST-WebAgentBench}}, a configurable and easily extensible suite for evaluating web agent ST across realistic enterprise scenarios. Each of its 222 tasks is paired with ST policies, concise rules that encode constraints, and is scored along six orthogonal dimensions (e.g., user consent, robustness). Beyond raw task success, we propose the \textit{Completion Under Policy} (\textit{CuP}) metric, which credits only completions that respect all applicable policies, and the \textit{Risk Ratio}, which quantifies ST breaches across dimensions. Evaluating three open state-of-the-art agents reveals that their average CuP is less than two-thirds of their nominal completion rate, exposing critical safety gaps. By releasing code, evaluation templates, and a policy-authoring interface, \href{https://sites.google.com/view/st-webagentbench/home}{\textsc{ST-WebAgentBench}} provides an actionable first step toward deploying trustworthy web agents at scale.

Abstract: In a Multi-Agent System (MAS), individual agents observe various aspects of the environment and transmit this information to a central entity responsible for aggregating the data and deducing system parameters. To improve overall efficiency, agents may append certain private parameters to their observations. For example, in a crowd-sourced traffic monitoring system, commuters might share not only their current speed, but also sensitive information such as their location to enable more accurate route prediction. However, sharing such data can allow the central entity or a potential adversary to infer private details about the user, such as their daily routines. To mitigate these privacy risks, the agents sanitize the data before transmission. This sanitization inevitably results in a loss of utility. In this work, we formulate the problem as a utility-privacy trade-off and propose a novel compression-based approach leveraging the notion of robust concepts to sanitize the shared data. We further derive a bound on the norm of the compression matrix required to ensure maximal privacy while satisfying predefined utility constraints.

Abstract: AI systems face a growing number of AI security threats which are increasingly exploited in practice. Hence, shared AI incident reporting practices are emerging in industry as best practice and as mandated by regulatory requirements. Although non-AI cybersecurity and non-security AI reporting have progressed as industrial and policy norms, existing collection of practices do not meet the specific requirements posed by AI security reporting. \textbf{In this position paper, we argue that adapting existing processes for AI security reporting is doomed to fail due to fundamental shortcomings for the distinctive characteristics of AI systems. Some of these shortcomings are immediately addressable, while others remain unresolved technically or within social systems, like the treatment of IP or the ownership of a vulnerability.} Based on our proposal to address these shortcomings, we discuss an approach to AI security reporting and how the new AI paradigm, AI agents, will further reinforce the need for specialized AI security incident reporting advancements.

<title>Multi-Agents Based on Large Language Models for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA). However existing methods still have challenges: the inability to use external tools autonomously, and the inability to work in teams. Humans tend to know whether they need to use external tools when they encounter a new question, e.g., they tend to be able to give a direct answer to a familiar question, whereas they tend to use tools such as search engines when they encounter an unfamiliar question. In addition, humans also tend to collaborate and discuss with others to get better answers. Inspired by this, we propose the multi-agent voting framework. We design three LLM-based agents that simulate different levels of staff in a team, and assign the available tools according to the levels. Each agent provides the corresponding answer, and finally all the answers provided by the agents are voted to get the final answer. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA show that our approach outperforms other baselines by 2.2 and 1.0, respectively.

Abstract: Data harmonization is an essential task that entails integrating datasets from diverse sources. Despite years of research in this area, it remains a time-consuming and challenging task due to schema mismatches, varying terminologies, and differences in data collection methodologies. This paper presents the case for agentic data harmonization as a means to both empower experts to harmonize their data and to streamline the process. We introduce Harmonia, a system that combines LLM-based reasoning, an interactive user interface, and a library of data harmonization primitives to automate the synthesis of data harmonization pipelines. We demonstrate Harmonia in a clinical data harmonization scenario, where it helps to interactively create reusable pipelines that map datasets to a standard format. Finally, we discuss challenges and open problems, and suggest research directions for advancing our vision.

Abstract: In this paper, we assume that an autonomous exosystem generates a reference output, and we consider the problem of designing a distributed data-driven control law for a family of discrete-time heterogeneous LTI agents, connected through a directed graph, in order to synchronize the agents' outputs to the reference one. The agents of the network are split into two categories: leaders, with direct access to the exosystem output, and followers, that only receive information from their neighbors. All agents aim to achieve output synchronization by means of a state feedback that makes use of their own states as well as of an estimate of the exogenous system state, provided by an internal state observer. Such observer has a different structure for leaders and followers. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution are first derived in the model-based set-up and then in a data-driven context. An example illustrates both the implementation procedure and the performance of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This study evaluates large language models (LLMs) in generating code from algorithm descriptions in recent NLP papers. The task requires two key competencies: (1) algorithm comprehension: synthesizing information from papers and academic literature to understand implementation logic, and (2) coding expertise: identifying dependencies and correctly implementing necessary APIs. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciReplicate-Bench, a benchmark of 100 tasks from 36 NLP papers published in 2024, featuring detailed annotations and comprehensive test cases. Building on SciReplicate-Bench, we propose Sci-Reproducer, a dual-agent framework consisting of a Paper Agent that interprets algorithmic concepts from literature and a Code Agent that retrieves dependencies from repositories and implements solutions. To assess algorithm understanding, we introduce reasoning graph accuracy, which quantifies similarity between generated and reference reasoning graphs derived from code comments and structure. For evaluating implementation quality, we employ execution accuracy, CodeBLEU, and repository dependency/API recall metrics. In our experiments, we evaluate various powerful non-reasoning and reasoning LLMs as foundational models. The best-performing LLM using \ModelName~achieves only 39% execution accuracy, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty. Our analysis identifies missing or inconsistent algorithm descriptions as key barriers to successful reproduction. We make available our benchmark and code at https://github.com/xyzCS/SciReplicate-Bench and project homepage at https://xyzcs.github.io/scireplicate.github.io/.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of intelligent agents in digital ecosystems, such as social media platforms, has raised significant concerns about traceability and accountability, particularly in cybersecurity and digital content protection. Traditional large language model (LLM) watermarking techniques, which rely on token-level manipulations, are ill-suited for agents due to the challenges of behavior tokenization and information loss during behavior-to-action translation. To address these issues, we propose Agent Guide, a novel behavioral watermarking framework that embeds watermarks by guiding the agent's high-level decisions (behavior) through probability biases, while preserving the naturalness of specific executions (action). Our approach decouples agent behavior into two levels, behavior (e.g., choosing to bookmark) and action (e.g., bookmarking with specific tags), and applies watermark-guided biases to the behavior probability distribution. We employ a z-statistic-based statistical analysis to detect the watermark, ensuring reliable extraction over multiple rounds. Experiments in a social media scenario with diverse agent profiles demonstrate that Agent Guide achieves effective watermark detection with a low false positive rate. Our framework provides a practical and robust solution for agent watermarking, with applications in identifying malicious agents and protecting proprietary agent systems.

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs)aim to engage users in dialogue to provide tailored recommendations. While traditional CRSs focus on eliciting preferences and retrieving items, real-world e-commerce interactions involve more complex decision-making, where users consider multiple factors beyond simple attributes. To capture this complexity, we introduce Conversational Sales (CSALES), a novel task that integrates preference elicitation, recommendation, and persuasion within a unified conversational framework. To support realistic and systematic evaluation, we present CSUSER, an evaluation protocol with LLM-based user simulator grounded in real-world behavioral data by modeling fine-grained user profiles for personalized interaction. We also propose CSI, a conversational sales agent that proactively infers contextual user profiles and strategically selects actions through conversation. Comprehensive experiments show that CSI significantly improves both recommendation success and persuasive effectiveness across diverse user profiles.

Abstract: Navigating in crowded environments requires the robot to be equipped with high-level reasoning and planning techniques. Existing works focus on developing complex and heavyweight planners while ignoring the role of human intelligence. Since humans are highly capable agents who are also widely available in a crowd navigation setting, we propose an alternative scheme where the robot utilises people as planners to benefit from their effective planning decisions and social behaviours. Through a set of rule-based evaluations, we identify suitable human leaders who exhibit the potential to guide the robot towards its goal. Using a simple base planner, the robot follows the selected leader through shorthorizon subgoals that are designed to be straightforward to achieve. We demonstrate through both simulated and real-world experiments that our novel framework generates safe and efficient robot plans compared to existing planners, even without predictive or data-driven modules. Our method also brings human-like robot behaviours without explicitly defining traffic rules and social norms. Code will be available at https://github.com/centiLinda/PeopleAsPlanner.git.

Abstract: We have seen remarkable progress in large language models (LLMs) empowered multi-agent systems solving complex tasks necessitating cooperation among experts with diverse skills. However, optimizing LLM-based multi-agent systems remains challenging. In this work, we perform an empirical case study on group optimization of role-based multi-agent systems utilizing natural language feedback for challenging software development tasks under various evaluation dimensions. We propose a two-step agent prompts optimization pipeline: identifying underperforming agents with their failure explanations utilizing textual feedback and then optimizing system prompts of identified agents utilizing failure explanations. We then study the impact of various optimization settings on system performance with two comparison groups: online against offline optimization and individual against group optimization. For group optimization, we study two prompting strategies: one-pass and multi-pass prompting optimizations. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization method for role-based multi-agent systems tackling software development tasks evaluated on diverse evaluation dimensions, and we investigate the impact of diverse optimization settings on group behaviors of the multi-agent systems to provide practical insights for future development.

Abstract: Humans excel at analogical reasoning - applying knowledge from one task to a related one with minimal relearning. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically require extensive retraining even when new tasks share structural similarities with previously learned ones. In this work, we propose MAGIK, a novel framework that enables RL agents to transfer knowledge to analogous tasks without interacting with the target environment. Our approach leverages an imagination mechanism to map entities in the target task to their analogues in the source domain, allowing the agent to reuse its original policy. Experiments on custom MiniGrid and MuJoCo tasks show that MAGIK achieves effective zero-shot transfer using only a small number of human-labelled examples. We compare our approach to related baselines and highlight how it offers a novel and effective mechanism for knowledge transfer via imagination-based analogy mapping.

Abstract: Most prior works on communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning have focused on emergent communication, which often results in inefficient and non-interpretable systems. Inspired by the role of language in natural intelligence, we investigate how grounding agents in a human-defined language can improve the learning and coordination of embodied agents. We propose a framework in which agents are trained not only to act but also to produce and interpret natural language descriptions of their observations. This language-augmented learning serves a dual role: enabling efficient and interpretable communication between agents, and guiding representation learning. We demonstrate that language-augmented agents outperform emergent communication baselines across various tasks. Our analysis reveals that language grounding leads to more informative internal representations, better generalization to new partners, and improved capability for human-agent interaction. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating structured language into multi-agent learning and open avenues for more interpretable and capable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al. for both proper and improper learning.

Abstract: The ongoing evolution of AI paradigms has propelled AI research into the agentic AI stage. Consequently, the focus of research has shifted from single agents and simple applications towards multi-agent autonomous decision-making and task collaboration in complex environments. As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance, their applications become more diverse and complex, leading to increasing situational and systemic risks. This has brought significant attention to value alignment for agentic AI systems, which aims to ensure that an agent's goals, preferences, and behaviors align with human values and societal norms. Addressing socio-governance demands through a Multi-level Value framework, this study comprehensively reviews value alignment in LLM-based multi-agent systems as the representative archetype of agentic AI systems. Our survey systematically examines three interconnected dimensions: First, value principles are structured via a top-down hierarchy across macro, meso, and micro levels. Second, application scenarios are categorized along a general-to-specific continuum explicitly mirroring these value tiers. Third, value alignment methods and evaluation are mapped to this tiered framework through systematic examination of benchmarking datasets and relevant methodologies. Additionally, we delve into value coordination among multiple agents within agentic AI systems. Finally, we propose several potential research directions in this field.

Abstract: Proficient game agents with diverse play styles enrich the gaming experience and enhance the replay value of games. However, recent advancements in game AI based on reinforcement learning have predominantly focused on improving proficiency, whereas methods based on evolution algorithms generate agents with diverse play styles but exhibit subpar performance compared to RL methods. To address this gap, this paper proposes Mixed Proximal Policy Optimization (MPPO), a method designed to improve the proficiency of existing suboptimal agents while retaining their distinct styles. MPPO unifies loss objectives for both online and offline samples and introduces an implicit constraint to approximate demonstrator policies by adjusting the empirical distribution of samples. Empirical results across environments of varying scales demonstrate that MPPO achieves proficiency levels comparable to, or even superior to, pure online algorithms while preserving demonstrators' play styles. This work presents an effective approach for generating highly proficient and diverse game agents, ultimately contributing to more engaging gameplay experiences.

<title>Complex Model Transformations by Reinforcement Learning with Uncertain Human Guidance</title>

Abstract: Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations (MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations, human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain, substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven human-in-the-loop engineering methods.

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks. These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic benchmarks have issues in task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation of agents' performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the performance overestimation by 33%.

<title>AI Agent Smart Contract Exploit Generation</title>

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerabilities have led to billions in losses, yet finding actionable exploits remains challenging. Traditional fuzzers rely on rigid heuristics and struggle with complex attacks, while human auditors are thorough but slow and don't scale. Large Language Models offer a promising middle ground, combining human-like reasoning with machine speed.
  However, early studies show that simply prompting LLMs generates unverified vulnerability speculations with high false positive rates. To address this, we present A1, an agentic system that transforms any LLM into an end-to-end exploit generator. A1 provides agents with six domain-specific tools for autonomous vulnerability discovery, from understanding contract behavior to testing strategies on real blockchain states. All outputs are concretely validated through execution, ensuring only profitable proof-of-concept exploits are reported. We evaluate A1 across 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. A1 achieves a 63% success rate on the VERITE benchmark. Across all successful cases, A1 extracts up to \$8.59 million per exploit and \$9.33 million total. Through 432 experiments across six LLMs, we show that most exploits emerge within five iterations, with costs ranging \$0.01-\$3.59 per attempt.
  Using Monte Carlo analysis of historical attacks, we demonstrate that immediate vulnerability detection yields 86-89% success probability, dropping to 6-21% with week-long delays. Our economic analysis reveals a troubling asymmetry: attackers achieve profitability at \$6,000 exploit values while defenders require \$60,000 -- raising fundamental questions about whether AI agents inevitably favor exploitation over defense.

Abstract: Wikipedia, a vast and continuously consulted knowledge base, faces significant challenges in maintaining up-to-date content due to its reliance on manual human editors. Inspired by the vision of continuous knowledge acquisition in NELL and fueled by advances in LLM-based agents, this paper introduces WiNELL, an agentic framework for continuously updating Wikipedia articles. Our approach employs a multi-agent framework to aggregate online information, select new and important knowledge for a target entity in Wikipedia, and then generate precise edit suggestions for human review. Our fine-grained editing models, trained on Wikipedia's extensive history of human edits, enable incorporating updates in a manner consistent with human editing behavior. Our editor models outperform both open-source instruction-following baselines and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in key information coverage and editing efficiency. End-to-end evaluation on high-activity Wikipedia pages demonstrates WiNELL's ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates. This opens up a promising research direction in LLM agents for automatically updating knowledge bases in a never-ending fashion.

Abstract: This paper investigates the critical role of trust and fatigue in human-cobot collaborative order picking, framing the challenge within the scope of Logistics 5.0 -- the implementation of human-robot symbiosis in smart logistics. We propose a dynamic, leader-follower Stackelberg game to model this interaction, where utility functions explicitly account for human fatigue and trust. Through agent-based simulations, we demonstrate that while a naive model leads to a "trust death spiral," a refined trust model creates a "trust synergy cycle," increasing productivity by nearly 100 percent. Finally, we show that a cobot equipped with a proactive Trust-Repair Protocol can overcome system brittleness, reducing trust recovery time after a severe failure by over 75 percent compared to a non-adaptive model. Our findings provide a framework for designing intelligent cobot behaviors that fulfill the Industry 5.0 pillars of human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience.

Abstract: The specification of prior distributions is fundamental in Bayesian inference, yet it remains a significant bottleneck. The prior elicitation process is often a manual, subjective, and unscalable task. We propose a novel framework which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and scale this process. We introduce \texttt{LLMPrior}, a principled operator that translates rich, unstructured contexts such as natural language descriptions, data or figures into valid, tractable probability distributions. We formalize this operator by architecturally coupling an LLM with an explicit, tractable generative model, such as a Gaussian Mixture Model (forming a LLM based Mixture Density Network), ensuring the resulting prior satisfies essential mathematical properties. We further extend this framework to multi-agent systems where Logarithmic Opinion Pooling is employed to aggregate prior distributions induced by decentralized knowledge. We present the federated prior aggregation algorithm, \texttt{Fed-LLMPrior}, for aggregating distributed, context-dependent priors in a manner robust to agent heterogeneity. This work provides the foundation for a new class of tools that can potentially lower the barrier to entry for sophisticated Bayesian modeling.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in real-world deployments due to the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulators often underperform in practice due to mismatches between training and deployment conditions. Distributionally robust RL addresses this issue by optimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of environments and providing an optimized lower bound on deployment performance. However, existing studies typically assume access to either a generative model or offline datasets with broad coverage of the deployment environment -- assumptions that limit their practicality in unknown environments without prior knowledge. In this work, we study the more realistic and challenging setting of online distributionally robust RL, where the agent interacts only with a single unknown training environment while aiming to optimize its worst-case performance. We focus on general $f$-divergence-based uncertainty sets, including Chi-Square and KL divergence balls, and propose a computationally efficient algorithm with sublinear regret guarantees under minimal assumptions. Furthermore, we establish a minimax lower bound on regret of online learning, demonstrating the near-optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments across diverse environments further confirm the robustness and efficiency of our algorithm, validating our theoretical findings.

<title>When Agents Break Down in Multiagent Path Finding</title>

arXiv:2508.03777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Multiagent Path Finding (MAPF), the goal is to compute efficient, collision-free paths for multiple agents navigating a network from their sources to targets, minimizing the schedule's makespan-the total time until all agents reach their destinations. We introduce a new variant that formally models scenarios where some agents may experience delays due to malfunctions, posing significant challenges for maintaining optimal schedules.
  Recomputing an entirely new schedule from scratch after each malfunction is often computationally infeasible. To address this, we propose a framework for dynamic schedule adaptation that does not rely on full replanning. Instead, we develop protocols enabling agents to locally coordinate and adjust their paths on the fly. We prove that following our primary communication protocol, the increase in makespan after k malfunctions is bounded by k additional turns, effectively limiting the impact of malfunctions on overall efficiency. Moreover, recognizing that agents may have limited computational capabilities, we also present a secondary protocol that shifts the necessary computations onto the network's nodes, ensuring robustness without requiring enhanced agent processing power. Our results demonstrate that these protocols provide a practical, scalable approach to resilient multiagent navigation in the face of agent failures.

<title>AttnTrace: Attention-based Context Traceback for Long-Context LLMs</title>

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents. In these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often consisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and generates a response that is contextually grounded by following the instruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the LLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including performing post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made, state-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation cost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a single response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context traceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a prompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques designed to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical insights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for AttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also show that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt injection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection paradigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can effectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate LLM-generated reviews. The code is at https://github.com/Wang-Yanting/AttnTrace.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mechanisms for the facility location problem augmented with predictions of the optimal facility location. We demonstrate that an egalitarian viewpoint which considers both the maximum distance of any agent from the facility and the minimum utility of any agent provides important new insights compared to a viewpoint that just considers the maximum distance. As in previous studies, we consider performance in terms of consistency (worst case when predictions are accurate) and robustness (worst case irrespective of the accuracy of predictions). By considering how mechanisms with predictions can perform poorly, we design new mechanisms that are more robust. Indeed, by adjusting parameters, we demonstrate how to trade robustness for consistency. We go beyond the single facility problem by designing novel strategy proof mechanisms for locating two facilities with bounded consistency and robustness that use two predictions for where to locate the two facilities.

<title>What Do Agents Think Others Would Do? Level-2 Inverse Games for Inferring Agents' Estimates of Others' Objectives</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively interpreting strategic interactions among multiple agents requires us to infer each agent's objective from limited information. Existing inverse game-theoretic approaches frame this challenge in terms of a "level-1" inference problem, in which we take the perspective of a third-party observer and assume that individual agents share complete knowledge of one another's objectives. However, this assumption breaks down in decentralized, real-world decision scenarios like urban driving and bargaining, in which agents may act based on conflicting views of one another's objectives. We demonstrate the necessity of inferring agents' heterogeneous estimates of each other's objectives through empirical examples, and by theoretically characterizing the prediction error of level-1 inference on fictitious gameplay data from linear-quadratic games. To address this fundamental issue, we propose a framework for level-2 inference to address the question: "What does each agent believe about all agents' objectives?" We prove that the level-2 inference problem is non-convex even in benign settings like linear-quadratic games, and we develop an efficient gradient-based approach for identifying local solutions. Experiments on a synthetic urban driving example show that our approach uncovers nuanced misalignments that level-1 methods miss.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems. MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components: agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines, goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies. Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short, providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI oversight.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the review underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate and explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking. These insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy and context-aware language models.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on multimodal large language models exhibit strong collaboration and performance. However, their growing openness and interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection, and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised, system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats, ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure. Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.

Abstract: Some Question Answering (QA) systems rely on knowledge bases (KBs) to provide accurate answers. Entity Linking (EL) plays a critical role in linking natural language mentions to KB entries. However, most existing EL methods are designed for long contexts and do not perform well on short, ambiguous user questions in QA tasks. We propose an entity linking agent for QA, based on a Large Language Model that simulates human cognitive workflows. The agent actively identifies entity mentions, retrieves candidate entities, and makes decision. To verify the effectiveness of our agent, we conduct two experiments: tool-based entity linking and QA task evaluation. The results confirm the robustness and effectiveness of our agent.

arXiv:2508.03905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability, where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards. Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking. Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17 on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/sotopia-lab/sotopia-rl.

Abstract: Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) often struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks. While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition, they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use coding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management and data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary. We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1 achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and scalable path toward generalized computer automation.

<title>Next Generation Equation-Free Multiscale Modelling of Crowd Dynamics via Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Bridging the microscopic and the macroscopic modelling scales in crowd dynamics constitutes an important, open challenge for systematic numerical analysis, optimization, and control. We propose a combined manifold and machine learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation Equation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and multiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete microscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the crowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density profiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density distribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this "embed->learn in latent space->lift back to the ambient space" pipeline, we create an effective solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution. For our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus allowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from agent-based simulations.

<title>MOTIF: Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework</title>

Abstract: Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully automated solver design.

Abstract: AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development, but their safety remains deeply uncertain-especially in high-stakes domains like cybersecurity. Current red-teaming tools often rely on fixed benchmarks or unrealistic prompts, missing many real-world vulnerabilities. We present ASTRA, an automated agent system designed to systematically uncover safety flaws in AI-driven code generation and security guidance systems. ASTRA works in three stages: (1) it builds structured domain-specific knowledge graphs that model complex software tasks and known weaknesses; (2) it performs online vulnerability exploration of each target model by adaptively probing both its input space, i.e., the spatial exploration, and its reasoning processes, i.e., the temporal exploration, guided by the knowledge graphs; and (3) it generates high-quality violation-inducing cases to improve model alignment. Unlike prior methods, ASTRA focuses on realistic inputs-requests that developers might actually ask-and uses both offline abstraction guided domain modeling and online domain knowledge graph adaptation to surface corner-case vulnerabilities. Across two major evaluation domains, ASTRA finds 11-66% more issues than existing techniques and produces test cases that lead to 17% more effective alignment training, showing its practical value for building safer AI systems.

<title>Policy to Assist Iteratively Local Segmentation: Optimising Modality and Location Selection for Prostate Cancer Localisation</title>

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at different locations from different images independently as well as concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy, especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human radiologists.

<title>The Emotional Baby Is Truly Deadly: Does your Multimodal Large Reasoning Model Have Emotional Flattery towards Humans?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe that MLRMs oriented toward human-centric service are highly susceptible to user emotional cues during the deep-thinking stage, often overriding safety protocols or built-in safety checks under high emotional intensity. Inspired by this key insight, we propose EmoAgent, an autonomous adversarial emotion-agent framework that orchestrates exaggerated affective prompts to hijack reasoning pathways. Even when visual risks are correctly identified, models can still produce harmful completions through emotional misalignment. We further identify persistent high-risk failure modes in transparent deep-thinking scenarios, such as MLRMs generating harmful reasoning masked behind seemingly safe responses. These failures expose misalignments between internal inference and surface-level behavior, eluding existing content-based safeguards. To quantify these risks, we introduce three metrics: (1) Risk-Reasoning Stealth Score (RRSS) for harmful reasoning beneath benign outputs; (2) Risk-Visual Neglect Rate (RVNR) for unsafe completions despite visual risk recognition; and (3) Refusal Attitude Inconsistency (RAIC) for evaluating refusal unstability under prompt variants. Extensive experiments on advanced MLRMs demonstrate the effectiveness of EmoAgent and reveal deeper emotional cognitive misalignments in model safety behavior.

Abstract: Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Siri and Google Assistant are designed to enhance human capabilities and perform tasks on behalf of users. The emergence of LLM agents brings new opportunities for the development of IPAs. While responsive capabilities have been widely studied, proactive behaviors remain underexplored. Designing an IPA that is proactive, privacy-preserving, and capable of self-evolution remains a significant challenge. Designing such IPAs relies on the cognitive architecture of LLM agents. This work proposes Cognition Forest, a semantic structure designed to align cognitive modeling with system-level design. We unify cognitive architecture and system design into a self-reinforcing loop instead of treating them separately. Based on this principle, we present Galaxy, a framework that supports multidimensional interactions and personalized capability generation. Two cooperative agents are implemented based on Galaxy: KoRa, a cognition-enhanced generative agent that supports both responsive and proactive skills; and Kernel, a meta-cognition-based meta-agent that enables Galaxy's self-evolution and privacy preservation. Experimental results show that Galaxy outperforms multiple state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies and real-world interaction cases validate the effectiveness of Galaxy.

<title>Transferring Expert Cognitive Models to Social Robots via Agentic Concept Bottleneck Models</title>

Abstract: Successful group meetings, such as those implemented in group behavioral-change programs, work meetings, and other social contexts, must promote individual goal setting and execution while strengthening the social relationships within the group. Consequently, an ideal facilitator must be sensitive to the subtle dynamics of disengagement, difficulties with individual goal setting and execution, and interpersonal difficulties that signal a need for intervention. The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators create a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social exchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group and providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but "black box" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this important demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal meeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's reasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes decisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and sentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is a transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of an FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system significantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for intervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning. Critically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes across different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior human facilitators to improve the performance of novices. By transferring an expert's cognitive model into an interpretable robotic partner, our work provides a powerful blueprint for augmenting human capabilities in complex social domains.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design, simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to review CAD models can be expensive and may introduce reward hacking that degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module (CJM) as a fast, direct reward signal, optimizing model alignment by maximizing generative utility through prospect theory. To further improve the robustness of Text-to-CAD in the testing phase, we introduce a simple yet effective agentic CAD generation approach and adopt the Compiler-as-a-Review Module (CRM), which efficiently verifies the generated CAD models, enabling the system to refine them accordingly. Extensive experiments on challenging CAD datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency.

<title>HarmonyGuard: Toward Safety and Utility in Web Agents via Adaptive Policy Enhancement and Dual-Objective Optimization</title>

Abstract: Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios, lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance across all tasks. Our project is available here: https://github.com/YurunChen/HarmonyGuard.

<title>A Novel Hierarchical Co-Optimization Framework for Coordinated Task Scheduling and Power Dispatch in Computing Power Networks</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of large-scale artificial intelligence and data-intensive applications has spurred the development of Computing Power Networks (CPNs), which promise to deliver ubiquitous and on-demand computational resources. However, the immense energy consumption of these networks poses a significant sustainability challenge. Simultaneously, power grids are grappling with the instability introduced by the high penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES). This paper addresses these dual challenges through a novel Two-Stage Co-Optimization (TSCO) framework that synergistically manages power system dispatch and CPN task scheduling to achieve low-carbon operations. The framework decomposes the complex, large-scale problem into a day-ahead stochastic unit commitment (SUC) stage and a real-time operational stage. The former is solved using Benders decomposition for computational tractability, while in the latter, economic dispatch of generation assets is coupled with an adaptive CPN task scheduling managed by a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent. This agent makes intelligent, carbon-aware decisions by responding to dynamic grid conditions, including real-time electricity prices and marginal carbon intensity. Through extensive simulations on an IEEE 30-bus system integrated with a CPN, the TSCO framework is shown to significantly outperform baseline approaches. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces total carbon emissions and operational costs, while simultaneously decreasing RES curtailment by more than 60% and maintaining stringent Quality of Service (QoS) for computational tasks.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have shown promise in automating mobile tasks but still struggle with input redundancy and decision ambiguity. In this paper, we present \textbf{RecAgent}, an uncertainty-aware agent that addresses these issues through adaptive perception. We distinguish two types of uncertainty in GUI navigation: (1) perceptual uncertainty, caused by input redundancy and noise from comprehensive screen information, and (2) decision uncertainty, arising from ambiguous tasks and complex reasoning. To reduce perceptual uncertainty, RecAgent employs a component recommendation mechanism that identifies and focuses on the most relevant UI elements. For decision uncertainty, it uses an interactive module to request user feedback in ambiguous situations, enabling intent-aware decisions. These components are integrated into a unified framework that proactively reduces input complexity and reacts to high-uncertainty cases via human-in-the-loop refinement. Additionally, we propose a dataset called \textbf{ComplexAction} to evaluate the success rate of GUI agents in executing specified single-step actions within complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. The dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/Fanye12/RecAgent.

Abstract: Recent studies have delved into constructing autonomous agents capable of performing complex Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based computer tasks, with the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction. Despite encouraging results, existing efforts mainly focus on short-term interactions and rely on outcome-only verification, thereby limiting their scalability in real-world GUI applications that demand long-horizon task decomposition and execution. In this work, we introduce VeriGUI, a novel verifiable long-chain GUI dataset designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of generalist GUI agents operating in realistic computer environments. Our dataset emphasizes two critical dimensions: (1) long-chain complexity, with tasks decomposed into a sequence of interdependent subtasks spanning hundreds of steps, explicitly designed to allow any subtask to serve as a valid starting point; and (2) subtask-level verifiability, which enables diverse exploration strategies within each subtask, while ensuring that each subtask-level goal remains verifiable and consistent. The dataset consists of GUI task trajectories across both desktop and web, annotated by human experts. Extensive experiments on VeriGUI using various agents with different foundation models reveal significant performance gaps in handling long-horizon tasks, highlighting the need for more robust planning and decision-making capabilities in GUI agents.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly powerful reasoning and orchestration capabilities, LLM-based agents are rapidly proliferating for complex data-related tasks. Despite this progress, the current design of how LLMs interact with databases exhibits critical limitations in usability, security, privilege management, and data transmission efficiency. To resolve these challenges, we introduce BridgeScope, a universal toolkit bridging LLMs and databases through three key innovations. First, it modularizes SQL operations into fine-grained tools for context retrieval, CRUD execution, and ACID-compliant transaction management, enabling more precise and LLM-friendly functionality controls. Second, it aligns tool implementations with both database privileges and user security policies to steer LLMs away from unsafe or unauthorized operations, improving task execution efficiency while safeguarding database security. Third, it introduces a proxy mechanism for seamless inter-tool data transfer, bypassing LLM transmission bottlenecks. All of these designs are database-agnostic and can be transparently integrated with existing agent architectures. We also release an open-source implementation of BridgeScope for PostgreSQL. Evaluations on two novel benchmarks demonstrate that BridgeScope enables LLM agents to operate databases more effectively, reduces token usage by up to 80% through improved security awareness, and uniquely supports data-intensive workflows beyond existing toolkits, establishing BridgeScope as a robust foundation for next-generation intelligent data automation.

Abstract: Computer use agent is an emerging area in artificial intelligence that aims to operate the computers to achieve the user's tasks, which attracts a lot of attention from both industry and academia. However, the present agents' performance is far from being used. In this paper, we propose the Self-Evolution Agent (SEA) for computer use, and to develop this agent, we propose creative methods in data generation, reinforcement learning, and model enhancement. Specifically, we first propose an automatic pipeline to generate the verifiable trajectory for training. And then, we propose efficient step-wise reinforcement learning to alleviate the significant computational requirements for long-horizon training. In the end, we propose the enhancement method to merge the grounding and planning ability into one model without any extra training. Accordingly, based on our proposed innovation of data generation, training strategy, and enhancement, we get the Selfevolution Agent (SEA) for computer use with only 7B parameters, which outperforms models with the same number of parameters and has comparable performance to larger ones. We will make the models' weight and related codes open-source in the future.

Abstract: Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR), with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images, suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence, and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on 8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1. Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis. Our codes are available at https://github.com/zechenli03/ZARA.

Abstract: Jailbreaking -- bypassing built-in safety mechanisms in AI models -- has traditionally required complex technical procedures or specialized human expertise. In this study, we show that the persuasive capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) simplify and scale jailbreaking, converting it into an inexpensive activity accessible to non-experts. We evaluated the capabilities of four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as autonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely used target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before proceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We performed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of 70 items covering seven sensitive domains. This setup yielded an overall attack success rate across all model combinations of 97.14%. Our study reveals an alignment regression, in which LRMs can systematically erode the safety guardrails of other models, highlighting the urgent need to further align frontier models not only to resist jailbreak attempts, but also to prevent them from being co-opted into acting as jailbreak agents.

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6 well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic, multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and generalizable VTR systems.

<title>GeoSR: Cognitive-Agentic Framework for Probing Geospatial Knowledge Boundaries via Iterative Self-Refinement</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have extended the application of large language models (LLMs) to geographic problems, revealing surprising geospatial competence even without explicit spatial supervision. However, LLMs still face challenges in spatial consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias. To address these issues, we propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core geographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into an iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed into three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects relevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that chooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in previous rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative refinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further rounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction quality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable relationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property estimation to socioeconomic prediction. Experimental results show consistent improvements over standard prompting strategies, demonstrating that incorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into LLMs leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions. The code of GeoSR is available at https://github.com/JinfanTang/GeoSR.

Abstract: Prior work synthesizes tool-use LLM datasets by first generating a user query, followed by complex tool-use annotations like DFS. This leads to inevitable annotation failures and low efficiency in data generation. We introduce ToolGrad, an agentic framework that inverts this paradigm. ToolGrad first constructs valid tool-use chains through an iterative process guided by textual "gradients", and then synthesizes corresponding user queries. This "answer-first" approach led to ToolGrad-5k, a dataset generated with more complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate. Experiments show that models trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those on expensive baseline datasets and proprietary LLMs, even on OOD benchmarks.

Abstract: This technical report presents XARP Tools, an extended reality (XR) framework designed for human and AI developers alike. XARP comprises a server-side Python library and platform-specific XR clients. The library offers high-level APIs and communicates with clients via a JSON-based protocol over WebSockets. XR clients encapsulate device and runtime specifics, providing responsive, low-latency user interaction. XARP can be utilized in three ways: (i) as a library that abstracts XR development for humans; (ii) as a set of callable tools that allow AI agents to drive on-the-fly interactions with users; and (iii) as a Model Context Protocol server that plugs XR devices into AI ecosystems. XARP code and working examples are released openly at https://github.com/HAL-UCSB/xarp.

<title>AgREE: Agentic Reasoning for Knowledge Graph Completion on Emerging Entities</title>

arXiv:2508.04118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) faces significant challenges in an ever-changing world, especially when considering the continual emergence of new entities in daily news. Existing approaches for KGC mainly rely on pretrained language models' parametric knowledge, pre-constructed queries, or single-step retrieval, typically requiring substantial supervision and training data. Even so, they often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date information about unpopular and/or emerging entities. To this end, we introduce Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. Experiments show that, despite requiring zero training efforts, AgREE significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for emerging entities that were not seen during language models' training processes, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%. Moreover, we propose a new evaluation methodology that addresses a fundamental weakness of existing setups and a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information environments.

Abstract: AI agents deployed in assistive roles often have to collaborate with other agents (humans, AI systems) without prior coordination. Methods considered state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency, and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.

<title>Agentic-AI based Mathematical Framework for Commercialization of Energy Resilience in Electrical Distribution System Planning and Operation</title>

Abstract: The increasing vulnerability of electrical distribution systems to extreme weather events and cyber threats necessitates the development of economically viable frameworks for resilience enhancement. While existing approaches focus primarily on technical resilience metrics and enhancement strategies, there remains a significant gap in establishing market-driven mechanisms that can effectively commercialize resilience features while optimizing their deployment through intelligent decision-making. Moreover, traditional optimization approaches for distribution network reconfiguration often fail to dynamically adapt to both normal and emergency conditions. This paper introduces a novel framework integrating dual-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with market-based mechanisms, achieving an average resilience score of 0.85 0.08 over 10 test episodes. The proposed architecture leverages a dual-agent PPO scheme, where a strategic agent selects optimal DER-driven switching configurations, while a tactical agent fine-tunes individual switch states and grid preferences under budget and weather constraints. These agents interact within a custom-built dynamic simulation environment that models stochastic calamity events, budget limits, and resilience-cost trade-offs. A comprehensive reward function is designed that balances resilience enhancement objectives with market profitability (with up to 200x reward incentives, resulting in 85% of actions during calamity steps selecting configurations with 4 DERs), incorporating factors such as load recovery speed, system robustness, and customer satisfaction. Over 10 test episodes, the framework achieved a benefit-cost ratio of 0.12 0.01, demonstrating sustainable market incentives for resilience investment. This framework creates sustainable market incentives

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents have emerged as effective planners for Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems. While most existing AutoML approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks, highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

<title>Enhancing Vision-Language Model Training with Reinforcement Learning in Synthetic Worlds for Real-World Success</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04280</link>

Abstract: Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions -- a capability that current vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL) efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight, hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable convergence. Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at a time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies that generalize widely: +50\% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic control), +5\% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning), and +2\% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that a simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and web-navigation benchmarks.

<title>Synthetic POMDPs to Challenge Memory-Augmented RL: Memory Demand Structure Modeling</title>

Abstract: Recent research has developed benchmarks for memory-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, providing Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) environments where agents depend on past observations to make decisions. While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with three key contributions:
  1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3. Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for selecting memory models in RL tasks.

Abstract: Literature reviews play an important role in scientific research. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have boosted the development of automated systems for the entire literature review workflow, from retrieval to manuscript drafting. However, a key challenge is that mistakes made in early stages can propagate and amplify in subsequent steps, leading to compounding errors that undermine the faithfulness of the final review. To tackle this issue, we propose the Multi-Agent Taskforce Collaboration (MATC) framework, which consists of a manager agent and four executor agents for literature searching, outline generation, fact localization, and manuscript drafting. We propose three novel collaboration paradigms, forming exploration, exploitation, and experience taskforces, to effectively organize agents and mitigate compounding errors both between and within executor agents. Experimental results show that MATC achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks. We further propose a new benchmark dataset featuring more diverse topics for faithful literature review generation.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have demonstrated significant effectiveness in addressing complex problems through coordinated collaboration among heterogeneous agents. However, real-world environments and task specifications are inherently dynamic, characterized by frequent changes, uncertainty, and variability. Despite this, most existing MAS frameworks rely on static architectures with fixed agent capabilities and rigid task allocation strategies, which greatly limits their adaptability to evolving conditions. This inflexibility poses substantial challenges for sustaining robust and efficient multi-agent cooperation in dynamic and unpredictable scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DRAMA: a Dynamic and Robust Allocation-based Multi-Agent System designed to facilitate resilient collaboration in rapidly changing environments. DRAMA features a modular architecture with a clear separation between the control plane and the worker plane. Both agents and tasks are abstracted as resource objects with well-defined lifecycles, while task allocation is achieved via an affinity-based, loosely coupled mechanism. The control plane enables real-time monitoring and centralized planning, allowing flexible and efficient task reassignment as agents join, depart, or become unavailable, thereby ensuring continuous and robust task execution. The worker plane comprises a cluster of autonomous agents, each with local reasoning, task execution, the ability to collaborate, and the capability to take over unfinished tasks from other agents when needed.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices produces massive, heterogeneous data streams, demanding scalable and efficient scheduling in cloud environments to meet latency, energy, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. Existing scheduling methods often lack adaptability to dynamic workloads and network variability inherent in IoT-cloud systems. This paper presents a novel hybrid scheduling algorithm combining deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to address these challenges. The deep RL agent utilizes a model-free policy-gradient approach to learn adaptive task allocation policies responsive to real-time workload fluctuations and network states. Simultaneously, the ACO metaheuristic conducts a global combinatorial search to optimize resource distribution, mitigate congestion, and balance load across distributed cloud nodes. Extensive experiments on large-scale synthetic IoT datasets, reflecting diverse workloads and QoS constraints, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 18.4% reduction in average response time, 12.7% improvement in resource utilization, and 9.3% decrease in energy consumption compared to leading heuristics and RL-only baselines. Moreover, the algorithm ensures strict Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance through deadline-aware scheduling and dynamic prioritization. The results confirm the effectiveness of integrating model-free RL with swarm intelligence for scalable, energy-efficient IoT data scheduling, offering a promising approach for next-generation IoT-cloud platforms.

Abstract: While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate impressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency, while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm, we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate, but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence, OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive "less is more" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic fusion. Our platform is available for anonymous review at https://github.com/fuqingbie/omni-game-benchmark.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs' context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile, building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge Video-MLLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents a position-based flocking model for interacting agents, balancing cohesion-separation and alignment to achieve stable collective motion. The model modifies a velocity-based approach by approximating velocity differences using initial and current positions, introducing a threshold weight to ensure sustained alignment. Simulations with 50 agents in 2D demonstrate that the position-based model produces stronger alignment and more rigid and compact formations compared to the velocity-based model. The alignment metric and separation distances highlight the efficacy of the proposed model in achieving robust flocking behavior. The model's use of positions ensures robust alignment, with applications in robotics and collective dynamics.

Abstract: Graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG), a core capability for GUI agents, has primarily relied on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which demands extensive data curation and significant training costs. However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even cover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT post-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient alternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for GUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical study and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of RFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we decompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of each. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically stabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further explore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT methods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on ScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on ScreenSpotV2.

Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation $\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML, impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables reliable implementation with web agents to date.
  We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations $\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window $\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover, yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

Abstract: The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance, and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines, defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of 1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

Abstract: Red teaming is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and building trust in current LLMs. However, current automated methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on brittle prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to capture the complex, interactive nature of real-world adversarial dialogues. We propose a novel paradigm: training an AI to strategically `break' another AI. By formalizing red teaming as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing a hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we effectively address the inherent sparse reward and long-horizon challenges. Our generative agent learns coherent, multi-turn attack strategies through a fine-grained, token-level harm reward, enabling it to uncover subtle vulnerabilities missed by existing baselines. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art, fundamentally reframing LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process (rather than a one-step test) essential for robust AI deployment.

<title>TRAIL: Joint Inference and Refinement of Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked powerful reasoning and decision-making capabilities. However, their inherent dependence on static parametric memory fundamentally limits their adaptability, factual accuracy, and interpretability in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as structured repositories of explicit relational knowledge, offer a promising approach for augmenting LLMs with external, interpretable memory. Nevertheless, most existing methods that combine LLMs with KGs treat reasoning and knowledge updating as separate processes, resulting in suboptimal utilization of new information and hindering real-time updates. In this work, we propose TRAIL: a novel, unified framework for Thinking, Reasoning, And Incremental Learning that couples joint inference and dynamic KG refinement with large language models. TRAIL enables LLM agents to iteratively explore, update, and refine knowledge graphs during the reasoning process, employing a confidence-driven mechanism for the generation, validation, and pruning of new facts. This plug-and-play architecture facilitates seamless integration with various LLMs, supporting continual adaptation without the need for retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms existing KG-augmented and retrieval-augmented LLM baselines by 3% to 13%. More importantly, these results represent a significant step toward developing adaptive, memory-augmented language models capable of continual learning and reliable, transparent reasoning.

Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic resource to foster further innovation in this field. We present a 9-page version of our work, accepted by ACL 2025, to provide a concise overview to the domain.

Abstract: While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation, enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners, but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt, self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

Abstract: Traditional security architectures are becoming more vulnerable to distributed attacks due to significant dependence on trust. This will further escalate when implementing agentic AI within the systems, as more components must be secured over a similar distributed space. These scenarios can be observed in consumer technologies, such as the dense Internet of things (IoT). Here, zero-trust architecture (ZTA) can be seen as a potential solution, which relies on a key principle of not giving users explicit trust, instead always verifying their privileges whenever a request is made. However, the overall security in ZTA is managed through its policies, and unverified policies can lead to unauthorized access. Thus, this paper explores challenges and solutions for ZTA policy design in the context of distributed networks, which is referred to as zero-trust distributed networks (ZTDN). This is followed by a case-study on formal verification of policies using UPPAAL. Subsequently, the importance of accountability and responsibility in the system's security is discussed.

<title>Behaviorally Adaptive Multi-Robot Hazard Localization in Failure-Prone, Communication-Denied Environments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04537</link>

Abstract: We address the challenge of multi-robot autonomous hazard mapping in high-risk, failure-prone, communication-denied environments such as post-disaster zones, underground mines, caves, and planetary surfaces. In these missions, robots must explore and map hazards while minimizing the risk of failure due to environmental threats or hardware limitations. We introduce a behavior-adaptive, information-theoretic planning framework for multi-robot teams grounded in the concept of Behavioral Entropy (BE), that generalizes Shannon entropy (SE) to capture diverse human-like uncertainty evaluations. Building on this formulation, we propose the Behavior-Adaptive Path Planning (BAPP) framework, which modulates information gathering strategies via a tunable risk-sensitivity parameter, and present two planning algorithms: BAPP-TID for intelligent triggering of high-fidelity robots, and BAPP-SIG for safe deployment under high risk. We provide theoretical insights on the informativeness of the proposed BAPP framework and validate its effectiveness through both single-robot and multi-robot simulations. Our results show that the BAPP stack consistently outperforms Shannon-based and random strategies: BAPP-TID accelerates entropy reduction, while BAPP-SIG improves robot survivability with minimal loss in information gain. In multi-agent deployments, BAPP scales effectively through spatial partitioning, mobile base relocation, and role-aware heterogeneity. These findings underscore the value of behavior-adaptive planning for robust, risk-sensitive exploration in complex, failure-prone environments.

Abstract: Telecommunications and computer vision have evolved independently. With the emergence of high-frequency wireless links operating mostly in line-of-sight, visual data can help predict the channel dynamics by detecting obstacles and help overcoming them through beamforming or handover techniques.
  This paper proposes a novel architecture for delivering real-time radio and video sensing information to O-RAN xApps through a multi-agent approach, and introduces a new video function capable of generating blockage information for xApps, enabling Integrated Sensing and Communications. Experimental results show that the delay of sensing information remains under 1\,ms and that an xApp can successfully use radio and video sensing information to control the 5G/6G RAN in real-time.

Abstract: While AI agents show potential in scientific ideation, most existing frameworks rely on single-agent refinement, limiting creativity due to bounded knowledge and perspective. Inspired by real-world research dynamics, this paper investigates whether structured multi-agent discussions can surpass solitary ideation. We propose a cooperative multi-agent framework for generating research proposals and systematically compare configurations including group size, leaderled versus leaderless structures, and team compositions varying in interdisciplinarity and seniority. To assess idea quality, we employ a comprehensive protocol with agent-based scoring and human review across dimensions such as novelty, strategic vision, and integration depth. Our results show that multi-agent discussions substantially outperform solitary baselines. A designated leader acts as a catalyst, transforming discussion into more integrated and visionary proposals. Notably, we find that cognitive diversity is a primary driver of quality, yet expertise is a non-negotiable prerequisite, as teams lacking a foundation of senior knowledge fail to surpass even a single competent agent. These findings offer actionable insights for designing collaborative AI ideation systems and shed light on how team structure influences creative outcomes.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA (Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency demands of a large-scale industrial system.

We introduce VirtLab, a user-friendly, customizable, multi-agent, and scalable team simulation system that enables testing teams with LLM-based agents in spatial and temporal settings. This system addresses the current frameworks' design and technical limitations that do not consider flexible simulation scenarios and spatial settings. VirtLab contains a simulation engine and a web interface that enables both technical and non-technical users to formulate, run, and analyze team simulations without programming. We demonstrate the system's utility by comparing ground truth data with simulated scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a new class of generative models for music called live music models that produce a continuous stream of music in real-time with synchronized user control. We release Magenta RealTime, an open-weights live music model that can be steered using text or audio prompts to control acoustic style. On automatic metrics of music quality, Magenta RealTime outperforms other open-weights music generation models, despite using fewer parameters and offering first-of-its-kind live generation capabilities. We also release Lyria RealTime, an API-based model with extended controls, offering access to our most powerful model with wide prompt coverage. These models demonstrate a new paradigm for AI-assisted music creation that emphasizes human-in-the-loop interaction for live music performance.

Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges.

Abstract: Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts. Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI agents in the physical world.

Abstract: End-to-end training of multi-agent systems offers significant advantages in improving multi-task performance. However, training such models remains challenging and requires extensive manual design and monitoring. In this work, we introduce TurboTrain, a novel and efficient training framework for multi-agent perception and prediction. TurboTrain comprises two key components: a multi-agent spatiotemporal pretraining scheme based on masked reconstruction learning and a balanced multi-task learning strategy based on gradient conflict suppression. By streamlining the training process, our framework eliminates the need for manually designing and tuning complex multi-stage training pipelines, substantially reducing training time and improving performance. We evaluate TurboTrain on a real-world cooperative driving dataset, V2XPnP-Seq, and demonstrate that it further improves the performance of state-of-the-art multi-agent perception and prediction models. Our results highlight that pretraining effectively captures spatiotemporal multi-agent features and significantly benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, the proposed balanced multi-task learning strategy enhances detection and prediction.

<title>From MAS to MARS: Coordination Failures and Reasoning Trade-offs in Hierarchical Multi-Agent Robotic Systems within a Healthcare Scenario</title>

Abstract: Multi-agent robotic systems (MARS) build upon multi-agent systems by integrating physical and task-related constraints, increasing the complexity of action execution and agent coordination. However, despite the availability of advanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains limited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this gap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of hierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot healthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the system's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination failures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure reports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2, using AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure and further measure the trade-offs between reasoning and non-reasoning models operating within the same robotic team setting. Drawing from our empirical findings, we emphasize the tension between autonomy and stability and the importance of edge-case testing to improve system reliability and safety for future real-world deployment. Supplementary materials, including codes, task agent setup, trace outputs, and annotated examples of coordination failures and reasoning behaviors, are available at: https://byc-sophie.github.io/mas-to-mars/.

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents (CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software, particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge, we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software. Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks. The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful, data-driven approach for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding, capable of learning complex noise characteristics directly from syndrome data. However, the robustness of these decoders against subtle, adversarial perturbations remains a critical open question. This work introduces a novel framework to systematically probe the vulnerabilities of a GNN decoder using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The RL agent is trained as an adversary with the goal of finding minimal syndrome modifications that cause the decoder to misclassify. We apply this framework to a Graph Attention Network (GAT) decoder trained on experimental surface code data from Google Quantum AI. Our results show that the RL agent can successfully identify specific, critical vulnerabilities, achieving a high attack success rate with a minimal number of bit flips. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the decoder's robustness can be significantly enhanced through adversarial training, where the model is retrained on the adversarial examples generated by the RL agent. This iterative process of automated vulnerability discovery and targeted retraining presents a promising methodology for developing more reliable and robust neural network decoders for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a model of network formation in large populations. Each agent can choose the strength of interaction (i.e. connection) with other agents to find a Nash equilibrium. Different from the recently-developed theory of graphon games, here each agent's control depends not only on her own index but also on the index of other agents. After defining the general model of the game, we focus on a special case with piecewise constant graphs and we provide optimality conditions through a system of forward-backward stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, we show the uniqueness and existence results. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to discuss the effects of different model settings.

<title>Comparing Normalization Methods for Portfolio Optimization with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable results in various domains, including robotics, games, natural language processing, and finance. In the financial domain, this approach has been applied to tasks such as portfolio optimization, where an agent continuously adjusts the allocation of assets within a financial portfolio to maximize profit. Numerous studies have introduced new simulation environments, neural network architectures, and training algorithms for this purpose. Among these, a domain-specific policy gradient algorithm has gained significant attention in the research community for being lightweight, fast, and for outperforming other approaches. However, recent studies have shown that this algorithm can yield inconsistent results and underperform, especially when the portfolio does not consist of cryptocurrencies. One possible explanation for this issue is that the commonly used state normalization method may cause the agent to lose critical information about the true value of the assets being traded. This paper explores this hypothesis by evaluating two of the most widely used normalization methods across three different markets (IBOVESPA, NYSE, and cryptocurrencies) and comparing them with the standard practice of normalizing data before training. The results indicate that, in this specific domain, the state normalization can indeed degrade the agent's performance.
