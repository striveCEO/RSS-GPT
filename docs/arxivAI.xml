Abstract: Agentic UAVs represent a new frontier in autonomous aerial intelligence, integrating perception, decision-making, memory, and collaborative planning to operate adaptively in complex, real-world environments. Driven by recent advances in Agentic AI, these systems surpass traditional UAVs by exhibiting goal-driven behavior, contextual reasoning, and interactive autonomy. We provide a comprehensive foundation for understanding the architectural components and enabling technologies that distinguish Agentic UAVs from traditional autonomous UAVs. Furthermore, a detailed comparative analysis highlights advancements in autonomy with AI agents, learning, and mission flexibility. This study explores seven high-impact application domains precision agriculture, construction & mining, disaster response, environmental monitoring, infrastructure inspection, logistics, security, and wildlife conservation, illustrating the broad societal value of agentic aerial intelligence. Furthermore, we identify key challenges in technical constraints, regulatory limitations, and data-model reliability, and we present emerging solutions across hardware innovation, learning architectures, and human-AI interaction. Finally, a future roadmap is proposed, outlining pathways toward self-evolving aerial ecosystems, system-level collaboration, and sustainable, equitable deployments. This survey establishes a foundational framework for the future development, deployment, and governance of agentic aerial systems (Agentic UAVs) across diverse societal and industrial domains.

Abstract: The emergence of capable large language model (LLM) based agents necessitates memory architectures that transcend mere data storage, enabling continuous learning, nuanced reasoning, and dynamic adaptation. Current memory systems often grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal awareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw interaction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory framework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph (STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles (IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and situational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving knowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive refinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of insight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived from identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental results demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing approaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering scenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence. The system achieves a notable 34% average improvement in task completion rates and a 42% reduction in mean query latency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, this paper explores the ethical considerations inherent in such advanced memory systems, discusses the implications for long-term memory in LLMs, and outlines promising future research trajectories.

<title>SOP-Bench: Complex Industrial SOPs for Evaluating LLM Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08119</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general-purpose reasoning and problem-solving abilities. However, they struggle with executing complex, long-horizon workflows that demand strict adherence to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), a critical requirement for real-world industrial automation. Despite this need, there is a lack of public benchmarks that reflect the complexity, structure, and domain-specific nuances of SOPs. To address this, we present three main contributions. First, we introduce a synthetic data generation framework to create realistic, industry-grade SOPs that rigorously test the planning, reasoning, and tool-use capabilities of LLM-based agents. Second, using this framework, we develop SOP-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,800 tasks across 10 industrial domains, each with APIs, tool interfaces, and human-validated test cases. Third, we evaluate two prominent agent architectures: Function-Calling and ReAct Agents, on SOP-Bench, observing average success rates of only 27% and 48%, respectively. Remarkably, when the tool registry is much larger than necessary, agents invoke incorrect tools nearly 100% of the time. These findings underscore a substantial gap between current agentic capabilities of LLMs and the demands of automating real-world SOPs. Performance varies significantly by task and domain, highlighting the need for domain-specific benchmarking and architectural choices before deployment. SOP-Bench is publicly available at http://sop-bench.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/. We also release the prompts underpinning the data generation framework to support new domain-specific SOP benchmarks. We invite the community to extend SOP-Bench with SOPs from their industrial domains.

<title>EconWebArena: Benchmarking Autonomous Agents on Economic Tasks in Realistic Web Environments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08136</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.08136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce EconWebArena, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents on complex, multimodal economic tasks in realistic web environments. The benchmark comprises 360 curated tasks from 82 authoritative websites spanning domains such as macroeconomics, labor, finance, trade, and public policy. Each task challenges agents to navigate live websites, interpret structured and visual content, interact with real interfaces, and extract precise, time-sensitive data through multi-step workflows. We construct the benchmark by prompting multiple large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate tasks, followed by rigorous human curation to ensure clarity, feasibility, and source reliability. Unlike prior work, EconWebArena emphasizes fidelity to authoritative data sources and the need for grounded web-based economic reasoning. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs as web agents, analyze failure cases, and conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of visual grounding, plan-based reasoning, and interaction design. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps and highlight persistent challenges in grounding, navigation, and multimodal understanding, positioning EconWebArena as a rigorous testbed for economic web intelligence.

Abstract: We study multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for tasks in complex high-dimensional environments, such as autonomous driving. MARL is known to suffer from the \textit{partial observability} and \textit{non-stationarity} issues. To tackle these challenges, information sharing is often employed, which however faces major hurdles in practice, including overwhelming communication overhead and scalability concerns. By making use of generative AI embodied in world model together with its latent representation, we develop {\it CALL}, \underline{C}ommunic\underline{a}tive Wor\underline{l}d Mode\underline{l}, for MARL, where 1) each agent first learns its world model that encodes its state and intention into low-dimensional latent representation with smaller memory footprint, which can be shared with other agents of interest via lightweight communication; and 2) each agent carries out ego-centric learning while exploiting lightweight information sharing to enrich her world model, and then exploits its generalization capacity to improve prediction for better planning. We characterize the gain on the prediction accuracy from the information sharing and its impact on performance gap. Extensive experiments are carried out on the challenging local trajectory planning tasks in the CARLA platform to demonstrate the performance gains of using \textit{CALL}.

<title>Interpreting Agent Behaviors in Reinforcement-Learning-Based Cyber-Battle Simulation Platforms</title>

Abstract: We analyze two open source deep reinforcement learning agents submitted to the CAGE Challenge 2 cyber defense challenge, where each competitor submitted an agent to defend a simulated network against each of several provided rules-based attack agents. We demonstrate that one can gain interpretability of agent successes and failures by simplifying the complex state and action spaces and by tracking important events, shedding light on the fine-grained behavior of both the defense and attack agents in each experimental scenario. By analyzing important events within an evaluation episode, we identify patterns in infiltration and clearing events that tell us how well the attacker and defender played their respective roles; for example, defenders were generally able to clear infiltrations within one or two timesteps of a host being exploited. By examining transitions in the environment's state caused by the various possible actions, we determine which actions tended to be effective and which did not, showing that certain important actions are between 40% and 99% ineffective. We examine how decoy services affect exploit success, concluding for instance that decoys block up to 94% of exploits that would directly grant privileged access to a host. Finally, we discuss the realism of the challenge and ways that the CAGE Challenge 4 has addressed some of our concerns.

<title>Scaling Laws of Motion Forecasting and Planning -- A Technical Report</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08228</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.08228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics. Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows, optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.

<title>From Debate to Equilibrium: Belief-Driven Multi-Agent LLM Reasoning via Bayesian Nash Equilibrium</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08292</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08292</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.08292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks can substantially boost the reasoning power of large language models (LLMs), but they typically incur heavy computational costs and lack convergence guarantees. To overcome these challenges, we recast multi-LLM coordination as an incomplete-information game and seek a Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE), in which each agent optimally responds to its probabilistic beliefs about the strategies of others. We introduce Efficient Coordination via Nash Equilibrium (ECON), a hierarchical reinforcement-learning paradigm that marries distributed reasoning with centralized final output. Under ECON, each LLM independently selects responses that maximize its expected reward, conditioned on its beliefs about co-agents, without requiring costly inter-agent exchanges. We mathematically prove that ECON attains a markedly tighter regret bound than non-equilibrium multi-agent schemes. Empirically, ECON outperforms existing multi-LLM approaches by 11.2% on average across six benchmarks spanning complex reasoning and planning tasks. Further experiments demonstrate ECON's ability to flexibly incorporate additional models, confirming its scalability and paving the way toward larger, more powerful multi-LLM ensembles. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/ECON.

<title>From Passive to Active Reasoning: Can Large Language Models Ask the Right Questions under Incomplete Information?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08295</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08295</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.08295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While existing benchmarks probe the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) across diverse domains, they predominantly assess passive reasoning, providing models with all the information needed to reach a solution. By contrast, active reasoning-where an LLM must interact with external systems to acquire missing evidence or data-has received little systematic attention. To address this shortfall, we present AR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed explicitly to evaluate an LLM's active reasoning skills. AR-Bench comprises three task families-detective cases, situation puzzles, and guessing numbers-that together simulate real-world, agentic scenarios and measure performance across commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoning challenges. Empirical evaluation on AR-Bench demonstrates that contemporary LLMs exhibit pronounced difficulties with active reasoning: they frequently fail to acquire or leverage the information needed to solve tasks. This gap highlights a stark divergence between their passive and active reasoning abilities. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that even advanced strategies, such as tree-based searching or post-training approaches, yield only modest gains and fall short of the levels required for real-world deployment. Collectively, these findings highlight the critical need to advance methodology for active reasoning, e.g., incorporating interactive learning, real-time feedback loops, and environment-aware objectives for training. The benchmark is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/AR-Bench.

<title>HiBerNAC: Hierarchical Brain-emulated Robotic Neural Agent Collective for Disentangling Complex Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal vision-language-action (VLA) models have revolutionized traditional robot learning, enabling systems to interpret vision, language, and action in unified frameworks for complex task planning. However, mastering complex manipulation tasks remains an open challenge, constrained by limitations in persistent contextual memory, multi-agent coordination under uncertainty, and dynamic long-horizon planning across variable sequences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{HiBerNAC}, a \textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{B}rain-\textbf{e}mulated \textbf{r}obotic \textbf{N}eural \textbf{A}gent \textbf{C}ollective, inspired by breakthroughs in neuroscience, particularly in neural circuit mechanisms and hierarchical decision-making. Our framework combines: (1) multimodal VLA planning and reasoning with (2) neuro-inspired reflection and multi-agent mechanisms, specifically designed for complex robotic manipulation tasks. By leveraging neuro-inspired functional modules with decentralized multi-agent collaboration, our approach enables robust and enhanced real-time execution of complex manipulation tasks. In addition, the agentic system exhibits scalable collective intelligence via dynamic agent specialization, adapting its coordination strategy to variable task horizons and complexity. Through extensive experiments on complex manipulation tasks compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, we demonstrate that \textbf{HiBerNAC} reduces average long-horizon task completion time by 23\%, and achieves non-zero success rates (12\textendash 31\%) on multi-path tasks where prior state-of-the-art VLA models consistently fail. These results provide indicative evidence for bridging biological cognition and robotic learning mechanisms.

Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), software engineering agents (SWE agents) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating a range of software tasks -- from code generation and repair to test case synthesis. These agents operate autonomously by interpreting user input and responding to environmental feedback. While various agent architectures have demonstrated strong empirical performance, the internal decision-making worfklows that drive their behavior remain poorly understood. Deeper insight into these workflows hold promise for improving both agent reliability and efficiency. In this work, we present the first systematic study of SWE agent behavior through the lens of execution traces. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose the first taxonomy of decision-making pathways across five representative agents; (2) using this taxonomy, we identify three core components essential to agent success -- bug localization, patch generation, and reproduction test generation -- and study each in depth; (3) we study the impact of test generation on successful patch production; and analyze strategies that can lead to successful test generation; (4) we further conduct the first large-scale code clone analysis comparing agent-generated and developer-written patches and provide a qualitative study revealing structural and stylistic differences in patch content. Together, these findings offer novel insights into agent design and open avenues for building agents that are both more effective and more aligned with human development practices.

Abstract: Machine learning has been widely used to optimize complex engineering workflows across numerous domains. In the context of integrated circuit design, modern flows (e.g., going from a register-transfer level netlist to physical layouts) involve extensive configuration via thousands of parameters, and small changes to these parameters can have large downstream impacts on desired outcomes - namely design performance, power, and area. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for learning and reasoning within such high-dimensional optimization tasks. In this work, we introduce ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent that automates parameter tuning in an open-source hardware design flow. ORFS-agent adaptively explores parameter configurations, demonstrating clear improvements over standard Bayesian optimization approaches in terms of resource efficiency and final design metrics. Our empirical evaluations on two different technology nodes and a range of circuit benchmarks indicate that ORFS-agent can improve both routed wirelength and effective clock period by over 13%, all while using 40% fewer optimization iterations. Moreover, by following natural language objectives to trade off certain metrics for others, ORFS-agent demonstrates a flexible and interpretable framework for multi-objective optimization. Crucially, RFS-agent is modular and model-agnostic, and can be plugged in to any frontier LLM without any further fine-tuning.

<title>Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks</title>

Abstract: Despite their growing adoption across domains, large language model (LLM)-powered agents face significant security risks from backdoor attacks during training and fine-tuning. These compromised agents can subsequently be manipulated to execute malicious operations when presented with specific triggers in their inputs or environments. To address this pressing risk, we present ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on LLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies among the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing on this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential backdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the agent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the agent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought trajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and the user's instruction. Extensive evaluation demonstrates ReAgent's effectiveness against various backdoor attacks across tasks. For instance, ReAgent reduces the attack success rate by up to 90\% in database operation tasks, outperforming existing defenses by large margins. This work reveals the potential of utilizing compromised agents themselves to mitigate backdoor risks.

<title>Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Reasoning towards Multi-Step Multi-Source Search in Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2506.08352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can face factual limitations when responding to time-sensitive queries about recent events that arise after their knowledge thresholds in the training corpus. Existing search-augmented approaches fall into two categories, each with distinct limitations: multi-agent search frameworks incur substantial computational overhead by separating search planning and response synthesis across multiple LLMs, while single-LLM tool-calling methods restrict themselves to sequential planned, single-query searches from sole search sources. We present Reasoning-Search (R-Search), a single-LLM search framework that unifies multi-step planning, multi-source search execution, and answer synthesis within one coherent inference process. Innovatively, it structure the output into four explicitly defined components, including reasoning steps that guide the search process (), a natural-language directed acyclic graph that represents the search plans with respect to diverse sources (), retrieved results from executing the search plans (), and synthesized final answers (). To enable effective generation of these structured outputs, we propose a specialized Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (ReFT) method based on GRPO, together with a multi-component reward function that optimizes LLM's answer correctness, structural validity of the generated DAG, and adherence to the defined output format. Experimental evaluation on FinSearchBench-24, SearchExpertBench-25, and seven Q and A benchmarks demonstrates that R-Search outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while achieving substantial efficiency gains through 70% reduction in context token usage and approximately 50% decrease in execution latency.

Abstract: Leveraging more test-time computation has proven to be an effective way to boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among various methods, the verify-and-improve paradigm stands out for enabling dynamic solution exploration and feedback incorporation. However, existing approaches often suffer from restricted feedback spaces and lack of coordinated training of different parties, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we model this multi-turn refinement process as a Markov Decision Process and introduce DPSDP (Direct Policy Search by Dynamic Programming), a reinforcement learning algorithm that trains an actor-critic LLM system to iteratively refine answers via direct preference learning on self-generated data. Theoretically, DPSDP can match the performance of any policy within the training distribution. Empirically, we instantiate DPSDP with various base models and show improvements on both in- and out-of-distribution benchmarks. For example, on benchmark MATH 500, majority voting over five refinement steps increases first-turn accuracy from 58.2% to 63.2% with Ministral-based models. An ablation study further confirms the benefits of multi-agent collaboration and out-of-distribution generalization.

Abstract: Machine translation has long been a central task in natural language processing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there has been remarkable progress in translation quality. However, fully realizing the translation potential of LLMs remains an open challenge. Recent studies have explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into collaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation quality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing multi-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from cognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators employ different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free translation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating outputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed multi-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with Cognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six functionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in human translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement, evaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering. By simulating an interactive and theory-grounded translation workflow, TACTIC effectively leverages the full capacity of LLMs for high-quality translation. Experimental results on diverse language pairs from the FLORES-200 and WMT24 benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the base model, TACTIC surpasses GPT-4.1 by an average of +0.6 XCOMET and +1.18 COMETKIWI-23. Compared to DeepSeek-R1, it further improves by +0.84 XCOMET and +2.99 COMETKIWI-23.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) have become mainstream methods in the field of sarcasm detection. However, existing LLM methods face challenges in irony detection, including: 1. single-perspective limitations, 2. insufficient comprehensive understanding, and 3. lack of interpretability. This paper introduces the Collaborative Agent Framework for Irony (CAF-I), an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to overcome these issues. CAF-I employs specialized agents for Context, Semantics, and Rhetoric, which perform multidimensional analysis and engage in interactive collaborative optimization. A Decision Agent then consolidates these perspectives, with a Refinement Evaluator Agent providing conditional feedback for optimization. Experiments on benchmark datasets establish CAF-I's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Achieving SOTA on the vast majority of metrics, CAF-I reaches an average Macro-F1 of 76.31, a 4.98 absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. This success is attained by its effective simulation of human-like multi-perspective analysis, enhancing detection accuracy and interpretability.

<title>Attention-based Learning for 3D Informative Path Planning</title>

arXiv:2506.08434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an attention-based deep reinforcement learning approach to address the adaptive informative path planning (IPP) problem in 3D space, where an aerial robot equipped with a downward-facing sensor must dynamically adjust its 3D position to balance sensing footprint and accuracy, and finally obtain a high-quality belief of an underlying field of interest over a given domain (e.g., presence of specific plants, hazardous gas, geological structures, etc.). In adaptive IPP tasks, the agent is tasked with maximizing information collected under time/distance constraints, continuously adapting its path based on newly acquired sensor data. To this end, we leverage attention mechanisms for their strong ability to capture global spatial dependencies across large action spaces, allowing the agent to learn an implicit estimation of environmental transitions. Our model builds a contextual belief representation over the entire domain, guiding sequential movement decisions that optimize both short- and long-term search objectives. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art planners demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces environmental uncertainty within constrained budgets, thus allowing the agent to effectively balance exploration and exploitation. We further show our model generalizes well to environments of varying sizes, highlighting its potential for many real-world applications.

Abstract: We study an online learning version of the generalized principal-agent model, where a principal interacts repeatedly with a strategic agent possessing private types, private rewards, and taking unobservable actions. The agent is non-myopic, optimizing a discounted sum of future rewards and may strategically misreport types to manipulate the principal's learning. The principal, observing only her own realized rewards and the agent's reported types, aims to learn an optimal coordination mechanism that minimizes strategic regret. We develop the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for this challenging setting. Our approach features a novel pipeline that combines (i) a delaying mechanism to incentivize approximately myopic agent behavior, (ii) an innovative reward angle estimation framework that uses sector tests and a matching procedure to recover type-dependent reward functions, and (iii) a pessimistic-optimistic LinUCB algorithm that enables the principal to explore efficiently while respecting the agent's incentive constraints. We establish a near optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ regret bound for learning the principal's optimal policy, where $\tilde{O}(\cdot) $ omits logarithmic factors. Our results open up new avenues for designing robust online learning algorithms for a wide range of game-theoretic settings involving private types and strategic agents.

<title>MasHost Builds It All: Autonomous Multi-Agent System Directed by Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Multi-agent systems (Mas) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex real-world tasks. However, existing Mas construction methods typically rely on manually crafted interaction mechanisms or heuristic rules, introducing human biases and constraining the autonomous ability. Even with recent advances in adaptive Mas construction, existing systems largely remain within the paradigm of semi-autonomous patterns. In this work, we propose MasHost, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based framework for autonomous and query-adaptive Mas design. By formulating Mas construction as a graph search problem, our proposed MasHost jointly samples agent roles and their interactions through a unified probabilistic sampling mechanism. Beyond the accuracy and efficiency objectives pursued in prior works, we introduce component rationality as an additional and novel design principle in Mas. To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we propose Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO), a novel RL strategy that collaboratively integrates group-relative advantages and action-wise rewards. To our knowledge, our proposed MasHost is the first RL-driven framework for autonomous Mas graph construction. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MasHost consistently outperforms most competitive baselines, validating its effectiveness, efficiency, and structure rationality.

<title>Generating Vision-Language Navigation Instructions Incorporated Fine-Grained Alignment Annotations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08566</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.08566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables intelligent agents to navigate environments by integrating visual perception and natural language instructions, yet faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of fine-grained cross-modal alignment annotations. Existing datasets primarily focus on global instruction-trajectory matching, neglecting sub-instruction-level and entity-level alignments critical for accurate navigation action decision-making. To address this limitation, we propose FCA-NIG, a generative framework that automatically constructs navigation instructions with dual-level fine-grained cross-modal annotations. In this framework, an augmented trajectory is first divided into sub-trajectories, which are then processed through GLIP-based landmark detection, crafted instruction construction, OFA-Speaker based R2R-like instruction generation, and CLIP-powered entity selection, generating sub-instruction-trajectory pairs with entity-landmark annotations. Finally, these sub-pairs are aggregated to form a complete instruction-trajectory pair. The framework generates the FCA-R2R dataset, the first large-scale augmentation dataset featuring precise sub-instruction-sub-trajectory and entity-landmark alignments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with FCA-R2R significantly improves the performance of multiple state-of-the-art VLN agents, including SF, EnvDrop, RecBERT, and HAMT. Incorporating sub-instruction-trajectory alignment enhances agents' state awareness and decision accuracy, while entity-landmark alignment further boosts navigation performance and generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness of FCA-NIG in generating high-quality, scalable training data without manual annotation, advancing fine-grained cross-modal learning in complex navigation tasks.

<title>HGFormer: A Hierarchical Graph Transformer Framework for Two-Stage Colonel Blotto Games via Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Two-stage Colonel Blotto game represents a typical adversarial resource allocation problem, in which two opposing agents sequentially allocate resources in a network topology across two phases: an initial resource deployment followed by multiple rounds of dynamic reallocation adjustments. The sequential dependency between game stages and the complex constraints imposed by the graph topology make it difficult for traditional approaches to attain a globally optimal strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical graph Transformer framework called HGformer. By incorporating an enhanced graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent hierarchical decision model, our approach enables efficient policy generation in large-scale adversarial environments. Moreover, we design a layer-by-layer feedback reinforcement learning algorithm that feeds the long-term returns from lower-level decisions back into the optimization of the higher-level strategy, thus bridging the coordination gap between the two decision-making stages. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing hierarchical decision-making or graph neural network methods, HGformer significantly improves resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, achieving superior overall performance in complex dynamic game scenarios.

Abstract: A universal controller for any robot morphology would greatly improve computational and data efficiency. By utilizing contextual information about the properties of individual robots and exploiting their modular structure in the architecture of deep reinforcement learning agents, steps have been made towards multi-robot control. Generalization to new, unseen robots, however, remains a challenge. In this paper we hypothesize that the relevant contextual information is partially observable, but that it can be inferred through interactions for better generalization to contexts that are not seen during training. To this extent, we implement a modular recurrent architecture and evaluate its generalization performance on a large set of MuJoCo robots. The results show a substantial improved performance on robots with unseen dynamics, kinematics, and topologies, in four different environments.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in reasoning and planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena, particularly within structured 3D environments, remains severely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhyBlock, a progressive benchmark designed to assess VLMs on physical understanding and planning through robotic 3D block assembly tasks. PhyBlock integrates a novel four-level cognitive hierarchy assembly task alongside targeted Visual Question Answering (VQA) samples, collectively aimed at evaluating progressive spatial reasoning and fundamental physical comprehension, including object properties, spatial relationships, and holistic scene understanding. PhyBlock includes 2600 block tasks (400 assembly tasks, 2200 VQA tasks) and evaluates models across three key dimensions: partial completion, failure diagnosis, and planning robustness. We benchmark 21 state-of-the-art VLMs, highlighting their strengths and limitations in physically grounded, multi-step planning. Our empirical findings indicate that the performance of VLMs exhibits pronounced limitations in high-level planning and reasoning capabilities, leading to a notable decline in performance for the growing complexity of the tasks. Error analysis reveals persistent difficulties in spatial orientation and dependency reasoning. Surprisingly, chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal improvements, suggesting spatial tasks heavily rely on intuitive model comprehension. We position PhyBlock as a unified testbed to advance embodied reasoning, bridging vision-language understanding and real-world physical problem-solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e., self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought) and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each other, and how this interaction affects their performance.

Abstract: Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents, i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.

Abstract: As AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly versatile and capable of addressing a broad spectrum of tasks, ensuring their security has become a critical challenge. Among the most pressing threats are prompt injection attacks, which exploit the agent's resilience on natural language inputs -- an especially dangerous threat when agents are granted tool access or handle sensitive information. In this work, we propose a set of principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to prompt injection. We systematically analyze these patterns, discuss their trade-offs in terms of utility and security, and illustrate their real-world applicability through a series of case studies.

<title>Agile Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Task Scheduling in Edge Computing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.08850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft real-time applications are becoming increasingly complex, posing significant challenges for scheduling offloaded tasks in edge computing environments while meeting task timing constraints. Moreover, the exponential growth of the search space, presence of multiple objectives and parameters, and highly dynamic nature of edge computing environments further exacerbate the complexity of task scheduling. As a result, schedulers based on heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms frequently encounter difficulties in generating optimal or near-optimal task schedules due to their constrained ability to adapt to the dynamic conditions and complex environmental characteristics of edge computing. Accordingly, reinforcement learning algorithms have been incorporated into schedulers to address the complexity and dynamic conditions inherent in task scheduling in edge computing. However, a significant limitation of reinforcement learning algorithms is the prolonged learning time required to adapt to new environments and to address medium- and large-scale problems. This challenge arises from the extensive global action space and frequent random exploration of irrelevant actions. Therefore, this study proposes Agile Reinforcement learning (aRL), in which the RL-agent performs informed exploration and executes only relevant actions. Consequently, the predictability of the RL-agent is enhanced, leading to rapid adaptation and convergence, which positions aRL as a suitable candidate for scheduling the tasks of soft real-time applications in edge computing. The experiments demonstrate that the combination of informed exploration and action-masking methods enables aRL to achieve a higher hit-ratio and converge faster than the baseline approaches.

<title>Deploying SICNav in the Field: Safe and Interactive Crowd Navigation using MPC and Bilevel Optimization</title>

Abstract: Safe and efficient navigation in crowded environments remains a critical challenge for robots that provide a variety of service tasks such as food delivery or autonomous wheelchair mobility. Classical robot crowd navigation methods decouple human motion prediction from robot motion planning, which neglects the closed-loop interactions between humans and robots. This lack of a model for human reactions to the robot plan (e.g. moving out of the way) can cause the robot to get stuck. Our proposed Safe and Interactive Crowd Navigation (SICNav) method is a bilevel Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that combines prediction and planning into one optimization problem, explicitly modeling interactions among agents. In this paper, we present a systems overview of the crowd navigation platform we use to deploy SICNav in previously unseen indoor and outdoor environments. We provide a preliminary analysis of the system's operation over the course of nearly 7 km of autonomous navigation over two hours in both indoor and outdoor environments.

Abstract: The paper considers the problem of finding the number of dominant voters in two-level voting procedures. At the first stage, voting is conducted among local groups of voters, and at the second stage, the results are aggregated to form a final decision. The goal is to determine the minimum proportion of voters supporting a proposal for it to be accepted. The paper uses the method of pairwise comparisons to analyze the structure of the problem and develop heuristic algorithms with guaranteed accuracy. Special cases are considered, including the agent communication graph as a tree, complete graph, or regular graph with an odd number of vertices. New heuristic algorithms are proposed for each case, along with pairwise comparison functions to estimate the accuracy of the solution. Results extend the use of polynomial algorithms to a broader class of problems, providing criteria for selecting the optimal algorithm during the post-processing stage.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training has fundamentally changed how machine learning research is done today: large foundation models are trained once, and then can be used by anyone in the community (including those without data or compute resources to train a model from scratch) to adapt and fine-tune to specific tasks. Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing because it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL, including sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a fundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions have long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across time is important. Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for modeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic model to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant future (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are often constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include in our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention increases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with generalized policy improvement. We call our proposed method intention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative methods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$ image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8 \times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\%$.

Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful tool for understanding self-organizing biological systems, but it is computationally intensive and often not analytically tractable. Equation learning (EQL) methods can derive continuum models from ABM data, but they typically require extensive simulations for each parameter set, raising concerns about generalizability. In this work, we extend EQL to Multi-experiment equation learning (ME-EQL) by introducing two methods: one-at-a-time ME-EQL (OAT ME-EQL), which learns individual models for each parameter set and connects them via interpolation, and embedded structure ME-EQL (ES ME-EQL), which builds a unified model library across parameters. We demonstrate these methods using a birth--death mean-field model and an on-lattice agent-based model of birth, death, and migration with spatial structure. Our results show that both methods significantly reduce the relative error in recovering parameters from agent-based simulations, with OAT ME-EQL offering better generalizability across parameter space. Our findings highlight the potential of equation learning from multiple experiments to enhance the generalizability and interpretability of learned models for complex biological systems.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, MLLM-based virtual agents have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, existing benchmarks face significant limitations, including uncontrollable task complexity, extensive manual annotation with limited scenarios, and a lack of multidimensional evaluation. In response to these challenges, we introduce OmniBench, a self-generating, cross-platform, graph-based benchmark with an automated pipeline for synthesizing tasks of controllable complexity through subtask composition. To evaluate the diverse capabilities of virtual agents on the graph, we further present OmniEval, a multidimensional evaluation framework that includes subtask-level evaluation, graph-based metrics, and comprehensive tests across 10 capabilities. Our synthesized dataset contains 36k graph-structured tasks across 20 scenarios, achieving a 91\% human acceptance rate. Training on our graph-structured data shows that it can more efficiently guide agents compared to manually annotated data. We conduct multidimensional evaluations for various open-source and closed-source models, revealing their performance across various capabilities and paving the way for future advancements.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks and robustness in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have been widely studied in various threat models; however, few consider environmental state perturbations, which are natural in embodied scenarios. To improve the robustness of DRL agents, we formulate the problem of environmental state perturbation, introducing a preliminary non-targeted attack method as a calibration adversary, and then propose a defense framework, named Boosted Adversarial Training (BAT), which first tunes the agents via supervised learning to avoid catastrophic failure and subsequently adversarially trains the agent with reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results substantiate the vulnerability of mainstream agents under environmental state perturbations and the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The defense results demonstrate that while existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms may not be suitable, our BAT framework can significantly enhance the robustness of agents against environmental state perturbations across various situations.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices. However, prior work has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation, Context Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in 20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online Chinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates with an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap. Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without significantly sacrificing inference overhead. The demo video, dataset, and code are available on the project page at https://ui-nexus.github.io.

Abstract: Performative Prediction addresses scenarios where deploying a model induces a distribution shift in the input data, such as individuals modifying their features and reapplying for a bank loan after rejection. Literature has had a theoretical perspective giving mathematical guarantees for convergence (either to the stable or optimal point). We believe that visualization of the loss landscape can complement this theoretical advances with practical insights. Therefore, (1) we introduce a simple decoupled risk visualization method inspired in the two-step process that performative prediction is. Our approach visualizes the risk landscape with respect to two parameter vectors: model parameters and data parameters. We use this method to propose new properties of the interest points, to examine how existing algorithms traverse the risk landscape and perform under more realistic conditions, including strategic classification with non-linear models. (2) Building on this decoupled risk visualization, we introduce a novel setting - extended Performative Prediction - which captures scenarios where the distribution reacts to a model different from the decision-making one, reflecting the reality that agents often lack full access to the deployed model.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan to open-source the entire framework.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

Abstract: How well do AI systems perform in algorithm engineering for hard optimization problems in domains such as package-delivery routing, crew scheduling, factory production planning, and power-grid balancing? We introduce ALE-Bench, a new benchmark for evaluating AI systems on score-based algorithmic programming contests. Drawing on real tasks from the AtCoder Heuristic Contests, ALE-Bench presents optimization problems that are computationally hard and admit no known exact solution. Unlike short-duration, pass/fail coding benchmarks, ALE-Bench encourages iterative solution refinement over long time horizons. Our software framework supports interactive agent architectures that leverage test-run feedback and visualizations. Our evaluation of frontier LLMs revealed that while they demonstrate high performance on specific problems, a notable gap remains compared to humans in terms of consistency across problems and long-horizon problem-solving capabilities. This highlights the need for this benchmark to foster future AI advancements.

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3 models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS) models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

Abstract: Microscopy is a primary source of information on materials structure and functionality at nanometer and atomic scales. The data generated is often well-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always consistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by major funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving insights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems, benchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient and analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new APIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics for automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation. Yet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the impact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization. Hackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML researchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel solutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for instrumentation, materials science, and applied ML. This hackathon produced benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes to support community growth and standardized workflows.

Abstract: In this work, we approach spoken Dialogue State Tracking (DST) by bridging the representation spaces of speech encoders and LLMs via a small connector module, with a focus on fully open-sourced and open-data components (WavLM-large, OLMo). We focus on ablating different aspects of such systems including full/LoRA adapter fine-tuning, the effect of agent turns in the dialogue history, as well as fuzzy matching-based output post-processing, which greatly improves performance of our systems on named entities in the dialogue slot values. We conduct our experiments on the SpokenWOZ dataset, and additionally utilize the Speech-Aware MultiWOZ dataset to augment our training data. Ultimately, our best-performing WavLM + connector + OLMo-1B aligned models achieve state of the art on the SpokenWOZ test set (34.66% JGA), and our system with Gemma-2-9B-instruct further surpasses this result, reaching 42.17% JGA on SpokenWOZ test.

Abstract: Resource allocation is fundamental to a variety of societal decision-making settings, ranging from the distribution of charitable donations to assigning limited public housing among interested families. A central challenge in this context is ensuring fair outcomes, which often requires balancing conflicting preferences of various stakeholders. While extensive research has been conducted on theoretical and algorithmic solutions within the fair division framework, much of this work neglects the subjective perception of fairness by individuals. This study focuses on the fairness notion of envy-freeness (EF), which ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent according to their own preferences. While the existence of exact EF allocations may not always be feasible, various approximate relaxations, such as counterfactual and epistemic EF, have been proposed. Through a series of experiments with human participants, we compare perceptions of fairness between three widely studied counterfactual and epistemic relaxations of EF. Our findings indicate that allocations based on epistemic EF are perceived as fairer than those based on counterfactual relaxations. Additionally, we examine a variety of factors, including scale, balance of outcomes, and cognitive effort involved in evaluating fairness and their role in the complexity of reasoning across treatments.

Abstract: In multi-agent systems (MAS), the dynamic interaction among multiple decision-makers is driven by their innate values, affecting the environment's state, and can cause specific behavioral patterns to emerge. On the other hand, innate values in cognitive modeling reflect individual interests and preferences for specific tasks and drive them to develop diverse skills and plans, satisfying their various needs and achieving common goals in cooperation. Therefore, building the awareness of AI agents to balance the group utilities and system costs and meet group members' needs in their cooperation is a crucial problem for individuals learning to support their community and even integrate into human society in the long term. However, the current MAS reinforcement learning domain lacks a general intrinsic model to describe agents' dynamic motivation for decision-making and learning from an individual needs perspective in their cooperation. To address the gap, this paper proposes a general MAS innate-values reinforcement learning (IVRL) architecture from the individual preferences angle. We tested the Multi-Agent IVRL Actor-Critic Model in different StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) settings, which demonstrated its potential to organize the group's behaviours to achieve better performance.

<title>Harnessing the Continuous Structure: Utilizing the First-order Approach in Online Contract Design</title>

Abstract: This work studies the online contract design problem. The principal's goal is to learn the optimal contract that maximizes her utility through repeated interactions, without prior knowledge of the agent's type (i.e., the agent's cost and production functions). We leverage the structure provided by continuous action spaces, which allows the application of first-order conditions (FOC) to characterize the agent's behavior. In some cases, we utilize conditions from the first-order approach (FOA) in economics, but in certain settings, we are able to apply FOC without additional assumptions, leading to simpler and more principled algorithms.
  We illustrate this approach in three problem settings. Firstly, we study the problem of learning the optimal contract when there can be many outcomes. In contrast to prior works that design highly specialized algorithms, we show that the problem can be directly reduced to Lipschitz bandits. Secondly, we study the problem of learning linear contracts. While the contracting problem involves hidden action (moral hazard) and the pricing problem involves hidden value (adverse selection), the two problems share a similar optimization structure, which enables direct reduction between the problem of learning linear contracts and dynamic pricing. Thirdly, we study the problem of learning contracts with many outcomes when agents are identical and provide an algorithm with polynomial sample complexity.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.

<title>Predictability Awareness for Efficient and Robust Multi-Agent Coordination</title>

Abstract: To safely and efficiently solve motion planning problems in multi-agent settings, most approaches attempt to solve a joint optimization that explicitly accounts for the responses triggered in other agents. This often results in solutions with an exponential computational complexity, making these methods intractable for complex scenarios with many agents. While sequential predict-and-plan approaches are more scalable, they tend to perform poorly in highly interactive environments. This paper proposes a method to improve the interactive capabilities of sequential predict-and-plan methods in multi-agent navigation problems by introducing predictability as an optimization objective. We interpret predictability through the use of general prediction models, by allowing agents to predict themselves and estimate how they align with these external predictions. We formally introduce this behavior through the free-energy of the system, which reduces under appropriate bounds to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between plan and prediction, and use this as a penalty for unpredictable trajectories.The proposed interpretation of predictability allows agents to more robustly leverage prediction models, and fosters a soft social convention that accelerates agreement on coordination strategies without the need of explicit high level control or communication. We show how this predictability-aware planning leads to lower-cost trajectories and reduces planning effort in a set of multi-robot problems, including autonomous driving experiments with human driver data, where we show that the benefits of considering predictability apply even when only the ego-agent uses this strategy.

Abstract: Innate values describe agents' intrinsic motivations, which reflect their inherent interests and preferences for pursuing goals and drive them to develop diverse skills that satisfy their various needs. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) is learning from interaction based on the feedback rewards of the environment. However, in real scenarios, the rewards are generated by agents' innate value systems, which differ vastly from individuals based on their needs and requirements. In other words, considering the AI agent as a self-organizing system, developing its awareness through balancing internal and external utilities based on its needs in different tasks is a crucial problem for individuals learning to support others and integrate community with safety and harmony in the long term. To address this gap, we propose a new RL model termed innate-values-driven RL (IVRL) based on combined motivations' models and expected utility theory to mimic its complex behaviors in the evolution through decision-making and learning. Then, we introduce two IVRL-based models: IV-DQN and IV-A2C. By comparing them with benchmark algorithms such as DQN, DDQN, A2C, and PPO in the Role-Playing Game (RPG) reinforcement learning test platform VIZDoom, we demonstrated that the IVRL-based models can help the agent rationally organize various needs, achieve better performance effectively.

Abstract: We present an Adversarially Pre-trained Transformer (APT) that is able to perform zero-shot meta-learning on tabular prediction tasks without pre-training on any real-world dataset, extending on the recent development of Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) and TabPFN. Specifically, APT is pre-trained with adversarial synthetic data agents, who continue to shift their underlying data generating distribution and deliberately challenge the model with different synthetic datasets. In addition, we propose a mixture block architecture that is able to handle classification tasks with arbitrary number of classes, addressing the class size limitation -- a crucial weakness of prior deep tabular zero-shot learners. In experiments, we show that our framework matches state-of-the-art performance on small classification tasks without filtering on dataset characteristics such as number of classes and number of missing values, while maintaining an average runtime under one second. On common benchmark dataset suites in both classification and regression, we show that adversarial pre-training was able to enhance TabPFN's performance. In our analysis, we demonstrate that the adversarial synthetic data agents were able to generate a more diverse collection of data compared to the ordinary random generator in TabPFN. In addition, we demonstrate that our mixture block neural design has improved generalizability and greatly accelerated pre-training.

Abstract: Memory is crucial for enabling agents to tackle complex tasks with temporal and spatial dependencies. While many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms incorporate memory, the field lacks a universal benchmark to assess an agent's memory capabilities across diverse scenarios. This gap is particularly evident in tabletop robotic manipulation, where memory is essential for solving tasks with partial observability and ensuring robust performance, yet no standardized benchmarks exist. To address this, we introduce MIKASA (Memory-Intensive Skills Assessment Suite for Agents), a comprehensive benchmark for memory RL, with three key contributions: (1) we propose a comprehensive classification framework for memory-intensive RL tasks, (2) we collect MIKASA-Base -- a unified benchmark that enables systematic evaluation of memory-enhanced agents across diverse scenarios, and (3) we develop MIKASA-Robo (pip install mikasa-robo-suite) -- a novel benchmark of 32 carefully designed memory-intensive tasks that assess memory capabilities in tabletop robotic manipulation. Our work introduces a unified framework to advance memory RL research, enabling more robust systems for real-world use. MIKASA is available at https://tinyurl.com/membenchrobots.

Abstract: In this paper, we adapt a two-species agent-based cancer model that describes the interaction between cancer cells and healthy cells on a uniform grid to include the interaction with a third species -- namely immune cells. We run six different scenarios to explore the competition between cancer and immune cells and the initial concentration of the immune cells on cancer dynamics. We then use coupled equation learning to construct a population-based reaction model for each scenario. We show how they can be unified into a single surrogate population-based reaction model, whose underlying three coupled ordinary differential equations are much easier to analyse than the original agent-based model. As an example, by finding the single steady state of the cancer concentration, we are able to find a linear relationship between this concentration and the initial concentration of the immune cells. This then enables us to estimate suitable values for the competition and initial concentration to reduce the cancer substantially without performing additional complex and expensive simulations from an agent-based stochastic model.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly gained popularity across all parts of society, including education. After initial skepticism and bans, many schools have chosen to embrace this new technology by integrating it into their curricula in the form of virtual tutors and teaching assistants. However, neither the companies developing this technology nor the public institutions involved in its implementation have set up a formal system to collect feedback from the stakeholders impacted by them. In this paper, we argue that understanding the perceptions of those directly or indirectly impacted by LLMs in the classroom, including parents and school staff, is essential for ensuring responsible use of AI in this critical domain.
  Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose the Contextualized Perceptions for the Adoption of LLMs in Education (Co-PALE) framework, which can be used to systematically elicit perceptions and inform whether and how LLM-based tools should be designed, developed, and deployed in the classroom. Second, we explain how our framework can be used to ground specific rubrics for eliciting perceptions of the relevant stakeholders in view of specific goals and context of implementation. Overall, Co-PALE is a practical step toward helping educational agents, policymakers, researchers, and technologists ensure the responsible and effective deployment of LLM-based systems across diverse learning contexts.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) browser assistants integrate powerful capabilities of GenAI in web browsers to provide rich experiences such as question answering, content summarization, and agentic navigation. These assistants, available today as browser extensions, can not only track detailed browsing activity such as search and click data, but can also autonomously perform tasks such as filling forms, raising significant privacy concerns. It is crucial to understand the design and operation of GenAI browser extensions, including how they collect, store, process, and share user data. To this end, we study their ability to profile users and personalize their responses based on explicit or inferred demographic attributes and interests of users. We perform network traffic analysis and use a novel prompting framework to audit tracking, profiling, and personalization by the ten most popular GenAI browser assistant extensions. We find that instead of relying on local in-browser models, these assistants largely depend on server-side APIs, which can be auto-invoked without explicit user interaction. When invoked, they collect and share webpage content, often the full HTML DOM and sometimes even the user's form inputs, with their first-party servers. Some assistants also share identifiers and user prompts with third-party trackers such as Google Analytics. The collection and sharing continues even if a webpage contains sensitive information such as health or personal information such as name or SSN entered in a web form. We find that several GenAI browser assistants infer demographic attributes such as age, gender, income, and interests and use this profile--which carries across browsing contexts--to personalize responses. In summary, our work shows that GenAI browser assistants can and do collect personal and sensitive information for profiling and personalization with little to no safeguards.

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are widely used for their strong asymptotic performance and training stability, but they struggle to scale with larger batch sizes, as additional parallel environments yield redundant data due to limited policy-induced diversity. In contrast, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) scale naturally and encourage exploration via randomized population-based search, but are often sample-inefficient. We propose Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO), a hybrid algorithm that combines the scalability and diversity of EAs with the performance and stability of policy gradients. EPO maintains a population of agents conditioned on latent variables, shares actor-critic network parameters for coherence and memory efficiency, and aggregates diverse experiences into a master agent. Across tasks in dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion, and classic control, EPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and scalability.

Abstract: As AI-driven agents become increasingly integrated into the digital ecosystem, they reshape how online advertising is perceived and processed. Particularly in the travel and hotel booking sector, these autonomous systems influence the effectiveness of traditional advertising formats. While visual cues and emotional appeals sway human users, AI agents prioritize structured data such as price, availability, and specifications. This study examines how different AI agents interact with online advertising, whether they incorporate ads into their decision-making processes, and which ad formats prove most effective. We analyze interaction patterns, click behavior, and decision-making strategies through experiments with multimodal language models such as OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our findings reveal that AI agents neither ignore nor systematically avoid advertisements but instead favor certain features-particularly keywords and structured data. These insights have significant implications for the future design of advertising strategies in AI-dominated digital environments.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is critical for autonomous driving, enabling unified modeling of static infrastructure and dynamic agents. In practice, autonomous vehicles may repeatedly traverse identical geographic locations under varying environmental conditions, such as weather fluctuations and illumination changes. Existing methods in 3D occupancy prediction predominantly integrate adjacent temporal contexts. However, these works neglect to leverage perceptual information, which is acquired from historical traversals of identical geographic locations. In this paper, we propose Longterm Memory Prior Occupancy (LMPOcc), the first 3D occupancy prediction methodology that exploits long-term memory priors derived from historical traversal perceptual outputs. We introduce a plug-and-play architecture that integrates long-term memory priors to enhance local perception while simultaneously constructing global occupancy representations. To adaptively aggregate prior features and current features, we develop an efficient lightweight Current-Prior Fusion module. Moreover, we propose a model-agnostic prior format to ensure compatibility across diverse occupancy prediction baselines. LMPOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance validated on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, especially on static semantic categories. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate LMPOcc's ability to construct global occupancy through multi-vehicle crowdsourcing.

Abstract: The allocation of resources among multiple agents is a fundamental problem in both economics and computer science. In these settings, fairness plays a crucial role in ensuring social acceptability and practical implementation of resource allocation algorithms. Traditional fair division solutions have given rise to a variety of approximate fairness notions, often as a response to the challenges posed by non-existence or computational intractability of exact solutions. However, the inherent incompatibility among these notions raises a critical question: which concept of fairness is most suitable for practical applications? In this paper, we examine two broad frameworks -- threshold-based and comparison-based fairness notions -- and evaluate their perceived fairness through a comprehensive human subject study. Our findings uncover novel insights into the interplay between perception of fairness, theoretical guarantees, the role of externalities and subjective valuations, and underlying cognitive processes, shedding light on the theory and practice of fair division.

Additionally, in games where bots are prohibited -- and even more so in non-game environments -- there is a need for methods capable of identifying whether digital interactions occur with bots or humans. This leads to two fundamental research questions: (1) how to model and implement human-like AI, and (2) how to measure its degree of human likeness.
  This article offers two contributions. The first one is a survey of the most significant challenges in implementing human-like AI in games (or any virtual environment featuring simulated agents, although this article specifically focuses on games). Thirteen such challenges, both conceptual and technical, are discussed in detail. The second is an empirical study performed in a tactical video game that addresses the research question: "Is it possible to distinguish human players from bots (AI agents) based on empirical data?" A machine-learning approach using a custom deep recurrent convolutional neural network is presented. We hypothesize that the more challenging it is to create human-like AI for a given game, the easier it becomes to develop a method for distinguishing humans from AI-driven players.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable progress across domains, yet their capabilities in the humanities, particularly history, remain underexplored. Historical reasoning poses unique challenges for AI, involving multimodal source interpretation, temporal inference, and cross-linguistic analysis. While general-purpose agents perform well on many existing benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage with historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce HistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate AI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert contributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual retrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and images, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or cultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and modern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world regions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we further present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully designed tools for OCR, translation, archival search, and image understanding in History. On HistBench, HistAgent based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of 27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, significantly outperforming LLMs with online search and generalist agents, including GPT-4o (18.60%), DeepSeek-R1(14.49%) and Open Deep Research-smolagents(20.29% pass@1 and 25.12% pass@2). These results highlight the limitations of existing LLMs and generalist agents and demonstrate the advantages of HistAgent for historical reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for simulating macroeconomic expectation formation using Large Language Model-Empowered Agents (LLM Agents). By constructing thousands of LLM Agents equipped with modules for personal characteristics, prior expectations, and knowledge, we replicate a survey experiment involving households and experts on inflation and unemployment. Our results show that although the expectations and thoughts generated by LLM Agents are more homogeneous than those of human participants, they still effectively capture key heterogeneity across agents and the underlying drivers of expectation formation. Furthermore, a module-ablation exercise highlights the critical role of prior expectations in simulating such heterogeneity. This approach complements traditional survey methods and offers new insights into AI behavioral science in macroeconomic research.

<title>Disentangling AI Alignment: A Structured Taxonomy Beyond Safety and Ethics</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in AI research make it increasingly plausible that artificial agents with consequential real-world impact will soon operate beyond tightly controlled environments. Ensuring that these agents are not only safe but that they adhere to broader normative expectations is thus an urgent interdisciplinary challenge. Multiple fields -- notably AI Safety, AI Alignment, and Machine Ethics -- claim to contribute to this task. However, the conceptual boundaries and interrelations among these domains remain vague, leaving researchers without clear guidance in positioning their work.
  To address this meta-challenge, we develop a structured conceptual framework for understanding AI alignment. Rather than focusing solely on alignment goals, we introduce a taxonomy distinguishing the alignment aim (safety, ethicality, legality, etc.), scope (outcome vs. execution), and constituency (individual vs. collective). This structural approach reveals multiple legitimate alignment configurations, providing a foundation for practical and philosophical integration across domains, and clarifying what it might mean for an agent to be aligned all-things-considered.

Abstract: Amongst the most common use cases of modern AI is LLM chat with web search enabled. However, no direct evaluations of the quality of web research agents exist that control for the continually-changing web. We introduce Deep Research Bench, consisting of 89 multi-step web research task instances of varying difficulty across 8 diverse task categories, with the answers carefully worked out by skilled humans. We provide a "RetroSearch" environment with a large frozen set of scraped web pages, and demonstrate that offline "RetroSearch" agents perform comparably to "live web" agents, enabling reliable evaluations of models over time. We provide robust agent tooling and scaffolding to benchmark major LLMs as they are released, including "thinking" models like o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro. We include automated evaluations of the lengthy agent traces to report progress over time in hallucinations, tool use, and forgetting. Finally, we evaluate the major web research products branded as "Deep Research", "Deep Search", "Search", or "Research." Results are available on a public leaderboard at https://drb.futuresearch.ai/.

<title>Mapping Human-Agent Co-Learning and Co-Adaptation: A Scoping Review</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06324</link>

Abstract: Several papers have delved into the challenges of human-AI-robot co-learning and co-adaptation. It has been noted that the terminology used to describe this collaborative relationship in existing studies needs to be more consistent. For example, the prefix "co" is used interchangeably to represent both "collaborative" and "mutual," and the terms "co-learning" and "co-adaptation" are sometimes used interchangeably. However, they can reflect subtle differences in the focus of the studies. The current scoping review's primary research question (RQ1) aims to gather existing papers discussing this collaboration pattern and examine the terms researchers use to describe this human-agent relationship. Given the relative newness of this area of study, we are also keen on exploring the specific types of intelligent agents and task domains that have been considered in existing research (RQ2). This exploration is significant as it can shed light on the diversity of human-agent interactions, from one-time to continuous learning/adaptation scenarios. It can also help us understand the dynamics of human-agent interactions in different task domains, guiding our expectations towards research situated in dynamic, complex domains. Our third objective (RQ3) is to investigate the cognitive theories and frameworks that have been utilized in existing studies to measure human-agent co-learning and co-adaptation. This investigation is crucial as it can help us understand the theoretical underpinnings of human-agent collaboration and adaptation, and it can also guide us in identifying any new frameworks proposed specifically for this type of relationship.

<title>Evolutionary model for energy trading in community microgrids using Hawk-Dove strategies</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06325</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06325</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.06325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized model of energy cooperation between microgrids, in which decisions are made locally, at the level of the microgrid community. Each microgrid is modeled as an autonomous agent that adopts a Hawk or Dove strategy, depending on the level of energy stored in the battery and its role in the energy trading process. The interactions between selling and buying microgrids are modeled through an evolutionary algorithm. An individual in the algorithm population is represented as an energy trading matrix that encodes the amounts of energy traded between the selling and buying microgrids. The population evolution is achieved by recombination and mutation operators. Recombination uses a specialized operator for matrix structures, and mutation is applied to the matrix elements according to a Gaussian distribution. The evaluation of an individual is made with a multi-criteria fitness function that considers the seller profit, the degree of energy stability at the community level, penalties for energy imbalance at the community level and for the degradation of microgrids batteries. The method was tested on a simulated scenario with 100 microgrids, each with its own selling and buying thresholds, to reflect a realistic environment with variable storage characteristics of microgrids batteries. By applying the algorithm on this scenario, 95 out of the 100 microgrids reached a stable energy state. This result confirms the effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving energy balance both at the individual level, for each microgrid, and at the level of the entire community.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a crucial challenge from fixed context windows and inadequate memory management, leading to a severe shortage of long-term memory capabilities and limited personalization in the interactive experience with AI agents. To overcome this challenge, we innovatively propose a Memory Operating System, i.e., MemoryOS, to achieve comprehensive and efficient memory management for AI agents. Inspired by the memory management principles in operating systems, MemoryOS designs a hierarchical storage architecture and consists of four key modules: Memory Storage, Updating, Retrieval, and Generation. Specifically, the architecture comprises three levels of storage units: short-term memory, mid-term memory, and long-term personal memory. Key operations within MemoryOS include dynamic updates between storage units: short-term to mid-term updates follow a dialogue-chain-based FIFO principle, while mid-term to long-term updates use a segmented page organization strategy. Our pioneering MemoryOS enables hierarchical memory integration and dynamic updating. Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo benchmark show an average improvement of 49.11% on F1 and 46.18% on BLEU-1 over the baselines on GPT-4o-mini, showing contextual coherence and personalized memory retention in long conversations. The implementation code is open-sourced at https://github.com/BAI-LAB/MemoryOS.

Abstract: This study explores strategies for optimizing news headline recommendations through preference-based learning. Using real-world data of user interactions with French-language online news posts, we learn a headline recommender agent under a contextual bandit setting. This allows us to explore the impact of translation on engagement predictions, as well as the benefits of different interactive strategies on user engagement during data collection. Our results show that explicit exploration may not be required in the presence of noisy contexts, opening the door to simpler but efficient strategies in practice.

<title>Optimized Local Updates in Federated Learning via Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed framework for collaborative model training over large-scale distributed data, enabling higher performance while maintaining client data privacy. However, the nature of model aggregation at the centralized server can result in a performance drop in the presence of non-IID data across different clients. We remark that training a client locally on more data than necessary does not benefit the overall performance of all clients. In this paper, we devise a novel framework that leverages a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to select an optimized amount of data necessary to train a client model without oversharing information with the server. Starting without awareness of the client's performance, the DRL agent utilizes the change in training loss as a reward signal and learns to optimize the amount of training data necessary for improving the client's performance. Specifically, after each aggregation round, the DRL algorithm considers the local performance as the current state and outputs the optimized weights for each class, in the training data, to be used during the next round of local training. In doing so, the agent learns a policy that creates an optimized partition of the local training dataset during the FL rounds. After FL, the client utilizes the entire local training dataset to further enhance its performance on its own data distribution, mitigating the non-IID effects of aggregation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that training FL clients through our algorithm results in superior performance on multiple benchmark datasets and FL frameworks. Our code is available at https://github.com/amuraddd/optimized_client_training.git.

<title>Will artificial agents pursue power by default?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.06352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers worried about catastrophic risks from advanced AI have argued that we should expect sufficiently capable AI agents to pursue power over humanity because power is a convergent instrumental goal, something that is useful for a wide range of final goals. Others have recently expressed skepticism of these claims. This paper aims to formalize the concepts of instrumental convergence and power-seeking in an abstract, decision-theoretic framework, and to assess the claim that power is a convergent instrumental goal. I conclude that this claim contains at least an element of truth, but might turn out to have limited predictive utility, since an agent's options cannot always be ranked in terms of power in the absence of substantive information about the agent's final goals. However, the fact of instrumental convergence is more predictive for agents who have a good shot at attaining absolute or near-absolute power.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) increasingly depend on advanced AI techniques to operate in critical applications. However, traditional verification and validation methods often struggle to handle the unpredictable and dynamic nature of AI components. In this paper, we introduce CPS-Guard, a novel framework that employs multi-role orchestration to automate the iterative assurance process for AI-powered CPS. By assigning specialized roles (e.g., safety monitoring, security assessment, fault injection, and recovery planning) to dedicated agents within a simulated environment, CPS-Guard continuously evaluates and refines AI behavior against a range of dependability requirements. We demonstrate the framework through a case study involving an autonomous vehicle navigating an intersection with an AI-based planner. Our results show that CPS-Guard effectively detects vulnerabilities, manages performance impacts, and supports adaptive recovery strategies, thereby offering a structured and extensible solution for rigorous V&amp;V in safety- and security-critical systems.

Abstract: Digital commerce thrives on advertising, with many of the largest technology companies relying on it as a significant source of revenue. However, in the context of information-seeking behavior, such as search, advertising may degrade the user experience by lowering search quality, misusing user data for inappropriate personalization, potentially misleading individuals, or even leading them toward harm. These challenges remain significant as conversational search technologies, such as ChatGPT, become widespread. This paper critically examines the future of advertising in conversational search, utilizing several speculative examples to illustrate the potential risks posed to users who seek guidance on sensitive topics. Additionally, it provides an overview of the forms that advertising might take in this space and introduces the "fake friend dilemma," the idea that a conversational agent may exploit unaligned user trust to achieve other objectives. This study presents a provocative discussion on the future of online advertising in the space of conversational search and ends with a call to action.

<title>BeliefMapNav: 3D Voxel-Based Belief Map for Zero-Shot Object Navigation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06487</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.06487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) allows robots to find target objects in unfamiliar environments using natural language instructions, without relying on pre-built maps or task-specific training. Recent general-purpose models, such as large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), equip agents with semantic reasoning abilities to estimate target object locations in a zero-shot manner. However, these models often greedily select the next goal without maintaining a global understanding of the environment and are fundamentally limited in the spatial reasoning necessary for effective navigation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D voxel-based belief map that estimates the target's prior presence distribution within a voxelized 3D space. This approach enables agents to integrate semantic priors from LLMs and visual embeddings with hierarchical spatial structure, alongside real-time observations, to build a comprehensive 3D global posterior belief of the target's location. Building on this 3D voxel map, we introduce BeliefMapNav, an efficient navigation system with two key advantages: i) grounding LLM semantic reasoning within the 3D hierarchical semantics voxel space for precise target position estimation, and ii) integrating sequential path planning to enable efficient global navigation decisions. Experiments on HM3D, MP3D, and HSSD benchmarks show that BeliefMapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), with a notable 46.4% SPL improvement over the previous best SR method, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Electronic design engineers often struggle to efficiently access relevant information for tasks like design verification and technology development. While large language models (LLMs) can enhance productivity as conversational agents, pre-trained open-source LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) context, LLMs rely on external context but may still produce inaccurate responses. Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) improves LLM performance, but acquiring labeled question/answer (Q/A) data in EDA is difficult. To address this, we propose using synthetic Q/A datasets to enhance LLMs with RAFT. Our results show that RAFT with synthetic data significantly boosts LLM performance for RAG-based EDA tasks. We also investigate the impact of using real user questions as Retrieval-Augmented Few-Shot (RAFS) examples for synthetic data generation. Additionally, we implement secure access control to ensure sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel. Finally, we assess the risk of data leakage and unintended memorization during fine-tuning with synthetic data, providing practical insights.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.06524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is much interest in using large pre-trained models in Automatic Game Design (AGD), whether via the generation of code, assets, or more abstract conceptualization of design ideas. But so far this interest largely stems from the ad hoc use of such generative models under persistent human supervision. Much work remains to show how these tools can be integrated into longer-time-horizon AGD pipelines, in which systems interface with game engines to test generated content autonomously. To this end, we introduce ScriptDoctor, a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven system for automatically generating and testing games in PuzzleScript, an expressive but highly constrained description language for turn-based puzzle games over 2D gridworlds. ScriptDoctor generates and tests game design ideas in an iterative loop, where human-authored examples are used to ground the system's output, compilation errors from the PuzzleScript engine are used to elicit functional code, and search-based agents play-test generated games. ScriptDoctor serves as a concrete example of the potential of automated, open-ended LLM-based workflows in generating novel game content.

Abstract: Constructing real-world data-to-insight pipelines often involves data extraction from data lakes, data integration across heterogeneous data sources, and diverse operations from data cleaning to analysis. The design and implementation of data science pipelines require domain knowledge, technical expertise, and even project-specific insights. AI systems have shown remarkable reasoning, coding, and understanding capabilities. However, it remains unclear to what extent these capabilities translate into successful design and execution of such complex pipelines. We introduce KRAMABENCH: a benchmark composed of 104 manually-curated real-world data science pipelines spanning 1700 data files from 24 data sources in 6 different domains. We show that these pipelines test the end-to-end capabilities of AI systems on data processing, requiring data discovery, wrangling and cleaning, efficient processing, statistical reasoning, and orchestrating data processing steps given a high-level task. Our evaluation tests 5 general models and 3 code generation models using our reference framework, DS-GURU, which instructs the AI model to decompose a question into a sequence of subtasks, reason through each step, and synthesize Python code that implements the proposed design. Our results on KRAMABENCH show that, although the models are sufficiently capable of solving well-specified data science code generation tasks, when extensive data processing and domain knowledge are required to construct real-world data science pipelines, existing out-of-box models fall short. Progress on KramaBench represents crucial steps towards developing autonomous data science agents for real-world applications. Our code, reference framework, and data are available at https://github.com/mitdbg/KramaBench.

arXiv:2506.06565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolving attacks are a critical challenge for the long-term success of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). The rise of these changing patterns has exposed the limitations of traditional network security methods. While signature-based methods are used to detect different types of attacks, they often fail to detect unknown attacks. Moreover, the system requires frequent updates with new signatures as the attackers are constantly changing their tactics. In this paper, we design an environment where two agents improve their policies over time. The adversarial agent, referred to as the red agent, perturbs packets to evade the intrusion detection mechanism, whereas the blue agent learns new defensive policies using drift adaptation techniques to counter the attacks. Both agents adapt iteratively: the red agent responds to the evolving NIDS, while the blue agent adjusts to emerging attack patterns. By studying the model's learned policy, we offer concrete insights into drift adaptation techniques with high utility. Experiments show that the blue agent boosts model accuracy by 30% with just 2 to 3 adaptation steps using only 25 to 30 samples each.

<title>Enhancing Robot Safety via MLLM-Based Semantic Interpretation of Failure Data</title>

arXiv:2506.06570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As robotic systems become increasingly integrated into real-world environments, ranging from autonomous vehicles to household assistants, they inevitably encounter diverse and unstructured scenarios that lead to failures. While such failures pose safety and reliability challenges, they also provide rich perceptual data for improving future performance. However, manually analyzing large-scale failure datasets is impractical. In this work, we present a method for automatically organizing large-scale robotic failure data into semantically meaningful clusters, enabling scalable learning from failure without human supervision. Our approach leverages the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), trained on internet-scale data, to infer high-level failure causes from raw perceptual trajectories and discover interpretable structure within uncurated failure logs. These semantic clusters reveal latent patterns and hypothesized causes of failure, enabling scalable learning from experience. We demonstrate that the discovered failure modes can guide targeted data collection for policy refinement, accelerating iterative improvement in agent policies and overall safety. Additionally, we show that these semantic clusters can be employed for online failure detection, offering a lightweight yet powerful safeguard for real-time adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework enhances robot learning and robustness by transforming real-world failures into actionable and interpretable signals for adaptation.

<title>The Optimization Paradox in Clinical AI Multi-Agent Systems</title>

arXiv:2506.06574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in clinical settings, yet the relationship between component-level optimization and system-wide performance remains poorly understood. We evaluated this relationship using 2,400 real patient cases from the MIMIC-CDM dataset across four abdominal pathologies (appendicitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis), decomposing clinical diagnosis into information gathering, interpretation, and differential diagnosis. We evaluated single agent systems (one model performing all tasks) against multi-agent systems (specialized models for each task) using comprehensive metrics spanning diagnostic outcomes, process adherence, and cost efficiency. Our results reveal a paradox: while multi-agent systems generally outperformed single agents, the component-optimized or Best of Breed system with superior components and excellent process metrics (85.5% information accuracy) significantly underperformed in diagnostic accuracy (67.7% vs. 77.4% for a top multi-agent system). This finding underscores that successful integration of AI in healthcare requires not just component level optimization but also attention to information flow and compatibility between agents. Our findings highlight the need for end to end system validation rather than relying on component metrics alone.

Abstract: The rapid rise of compound AI systems (a.k.a., AI agents) is reshaping the labor market, raising concerns about job displacement, diminished human agency, and overreliance on automation. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel auditing framework to assess which occupational tasks workers want AI agents to automate or augment, and how those desires align with the current technological capabilities. Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to capture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a shared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using this framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S. Department of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain workers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks spanning 104 occupations. Jointly considering the desire and technological capability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation "Green Light" Zone, Automation "Red Light" Zone, R&amp;D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone. This highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development. Moving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse HAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for human involvement. Moreover, our study offers early signals of how AI agent integration may reshape the core human competencies, shifting from information-focused skills to interpersonal ones. These findings underscore the importance of aligning AI agent development with human desires and preparing workers for evolving workplace dynamics.

Abstract: Insufficient data volume and quality are particularly pressing challenges in the adoption of modern subsymbolic AI. To alleviate these challenges, AI simulation uses virtual training environments in which AI agents can be safely and efficiently developed with simulated, synthetic data. Digital twins open new avenues in AI simulation, as these high-fidelity virtual replicas of physical systems are equipped with state-of-the-art simulators and the ability to further interact with the physical system for additional data collection. In this article, we report on our systematic survey of digital twin-enabled AI simulation. By analyzing 22 primary studies, we identify technological trends and derive a reference framework to situate digital twins and AI components. Based on our findings, we derive a reference framework and provide architectural guidelines by mapping it onto the ISO 23247 reference architecture for digital twins. Finally, we identify challenges and research opportunities for prospective researchers.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) policies trained on offline datasets often exhibit degraded task performance when deployed in unfamiliar navigation environments at test time, where agents are typically evaluated without access to external interaction or feedback. Entropy minimization has emerged as a practical solution for reducing prediction uncertainty at test time; however, it can suffer from accumulated errors, as agents may become overconfident in incorrect actions without sufficient contextual grounding. To tackle these challenges, we introduce ATENA (Active TEst-time Navigation Agent), a test-time active learning framework that enables a practical human-robot interaction via episodic feedback on uncertain navigation outcomes. In particular, ATENA learns to increase certainty in successful episodes and decrease it in failed ones, improving uncertainty calibration. Here, we propose mixture entropy optimization, where entropy is obtained from a combination of the action and pseudo-expert distributions-a hypothetical action distribution assuming the agent's selected action to be optimal-controlling both prediction confidence and action preference. In addition, we propose a self-active learning strategy that enables an agent to evaluate its navigation outcomes based on confident predictions. As a result, the agent stays actively engaged throughout all iterations, leading to well-grounded and adaptive decision-making. Extensive evaluations on challenging VLN benchmarks-REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE-demonstrate that ATENA successfully overcomes distributional shifts at test time, outperforming the compared baseline methods across various settings.

Abstract: Video generative models trained on expert demonstrations have been utilized as performant text-conditioned visual planners for solving robotic tasks. However, generalization to unseen tasks remains a challenge. Whereas improved generalization may be facilitated by leveraging learned prior knowledge from additional pre-collected offline data sources, such as web-scale video datasets, in the era of experience we aim to design agents that can continuously improve in an online manner from self-collected behaviors. In this work we thus propose the Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), where an in-domain video model iteratively updates itself on self-produced trajectories, collected through adaptation with an internet-scale pretrained video model, and steadily improves its performance for a specified task of interest. We apply SAIL to a diverse suite of MetaWorld tasks, as well as two manipulation tasks on a real robot arm, and find that performance improvements continuously emerge over multiple iterations for novel tasks initially unseen during original in-domain video model training. Furthermore, we discover that SAIL is surprisingly robust regarding if and how the self-collected experience is filtered, and the quality of the initial in-domain demonstrations. Through adaptation with summarized internet-scale data, and learning through online experience, we thus demonstrate a way to iteratively bootstrap a high-performance video model for solving novel robotic tasks through self-improvement.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have been applied to sequential decision-making tasks such as web navigation, but without any environment-specific experiences, they often fail in these complex tasks. Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually learn from past experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for them to gain these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose Contextual Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer. These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments. We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On VisualWebArena, CER achieves a competitive performance of 31.9%. On WebArena, CER also gets a competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis on it to prove its efficiency, validity and understand it better.

<title>WorldLLM: Improving LLMs' world modeling using curiosity-driven theory-making</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess general world knowledge but often struggle to generate precise predictions in structured, domain-specific contexts such as simulations. These limitations arise from their inability to ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment dynamics.

Abstract: Psychological counseling faces huge challenges due to the growing demand for mental health services and the shortage of trained professionals. Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to assist psychological counseling, especially in empathy and emotional support. However, existing models lack a deep understanding of emotions and are unable to generate personalized treatment plans based on fine-grained emotions. To address these shortcomings, we present AI PsyRoom, a multi-agent simulation framework designed to enhance psychological counseling by generating empathetic and emotionally nuanced conversations. By leveraging fine-grained emotion classification and a multi-agent framework, we construct a multi-agent PsyRoom A for dialogue reconstruction, generating a high-quality dialogue dataset EmoPsy, which contains 35 sub-emotions, 423 specific emotion scenarios, and 12,350 dialogues. We also propose PsyRoom B for generating personalized treatment plans. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AI PsyRoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 18% improvement in problem orientation, 23% in expression, 24% in Empathy, and 16% in interactive communication quality. The datasets and models are publicly available, providing a foundation for advancing AI-assisted psychological counseling research.

<title>Learning What Matters Now: A Dual-Critic Context-Aware RL Framework for Priority-Driven Information Gain</title>

Abstract: Autonomous systems operating in high-stakes search-and-rescue (SAR) missions must continuously gather mission-critical information while flexibly adapting to shifting operational priorities. We propose CA-MIQ (Context-Aware Max-Information Q-learning), a lightweight dual-critic reinforcement learning (RL) framework that dynamically adjusts its exploration strategy whenever mission priorities change. CA-MIQ pairs a standard extrinsic critic for task reward with an intrinsic critic that fuses state-novelty, information-location awareness, and real-time priority alignment. A built-in shift detector triggers transient exploration boosts and selective critic resets, allowing the agent to re-focus after a priority revision. In a simulated SAR grid-world, where experiments specifically test adaptation to changes in the priority order of information types the agent is expected to focus on, CA-MIQ achieves nearly four times higher mission-success rates than baselines after a single priority shift and more than three times better performance in multiple-shift scenarios, achieving 100% recovery while baseline methods fail to adapt. These results highlight CA-MIQ's effectiveness in any discrete environment with piecewise-stationary information-value distributions.

<title>Is Optimal Transport Necessary for Inverse Reinforcement Learning?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to recover a reward function from expert demonstrations. Recently, Optimal Transport (OT) methods have been successfully deployed to align trajectories and infer rewards. While OT-based methods have shown strong empirical results, they introduce algorithmic complexity, hyperparameter sensitivity, and require solving the OT optimization problems. In this work, we challenge the necessity of OT in IRL by proposing two simple, heuristic alternatives: (1) Minimum-Distance Reward, which assigns rewards based on the nearest expert state regardless of temporal order; and (2) Segment-Matching Reward, which incorporates lightweight temporal alignment by matching agent states to corresponding segments in the expert trajectory. These methods avoid optimization, exhibit linear-time complexity, and are easy to implement. Through extensive evaluations across 32 online and offline benchmarks with three reinforcement learning algorithms, we show that our simple rewards match or outperform recent OT-based approaches. Our findings suggest that the core benefits of OT may arise from basic proximity alignment rather than its optimal coupling formulation, advocating for reevaluation of complexity in future IRL design.

<title>AI-Generated Compromises for Coalition Formation</title>

Abstract: The challenge of finding compromises between agent proposals is fundamental to AI subfields such as argumentation, mediation, and negotiation. Building on this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo, using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. A crucial step in this process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals remains an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a model that incorporates agent bounded rationality and uncertainty, and by developing AI methods to generate compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaborative document writing, such as the democratic drafting of a community constitution. Our approach uses natural language processing techniques and large language models to induce a semantic metric space over text. Based on this space, we design algorithms to suggest compromise points likely to receive broad support. To evaluate our methods, we simulate coalition formation processes and show that AI can facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, a domain where traditional tools are limited.

<title>United Minds or Isolated Agents? Exploring Coordination of LLMs under Cognitive Load Theory</title>

arXiv:2506.06843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a notable performance ceiling on complex, multi-faceted tasks, as they often fail to integrate diverse information or adhere to multiple constraints. We posit that such limitation arises when the demands of a task exceed the LLM's effective cognitive load capacity. This interpretation draws a strong analogy to Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) in cognitive science, which explains similar performance boundaries in the human mind, and is further supported by emerging evidence that reveals LLMs have bounded working memory characteristics. Building upon this CLT-grounded understanding, we introduce CoThinker, a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework designed to mitigate cognitive overload and enhance collaborative problem-solving abilities. CoThinker operationalizes CLT principles by distributing intrinsic cognitive load through agent specialization and managing transactional load via structured communication and a collective working memory. We empirically validate CoThinker on complex problem-solving tasks and fabricated high cognitive load scenarios, demonstrating improvements over existing multi-agent baselines in solution quality and efficiency. Our analysis reveals characteristic interaction patterns, providing insights into the emergence of collective cognition and effective load management, thus offering a principled approach to overcoming LLM performance ceilings.

Abstract: Predicting the motion of other agents in a scene is highly relevant for autonomous driving, as it allows a self-driving car to anticipate. Inspired by the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Different from existing encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that the model is always provided with up-to-date information, enhancing the performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the network the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future, and further improves the performance. With experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.

<title>Multimodal Spatial Language Maps for Robot Navigation and Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Grounding language to a navigating agent's observations can leverage pretrained multimodal foundation models to match perceptions to object or event descriptions. However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment mapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional modality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal spatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained multimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these maps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our maps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural language commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., "in between the sofa and TV") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across different robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand. Building upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a unified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues through the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models. This enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or audio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the incorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal disambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps enable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by 50% in ambiguous scenarios. These capabilities extend to mobile robots and tabletop manipulators, supporting navigation and interaction guided by visual, audio, and spatial cues.

<title>Boosting LLM Reasoning via Spontaneous Self-Correction</title>

arXiv:2506.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success on a broad range of tasks, math reasoning remains a challenging one. One of the approaches for improving math reasoning is self-correction, which designs self-improving loops to let the model correct its own mistakes. However, existing self-correction approaches treat corrections as standalone post-generation refinements, relying on extra prompt and system designs to elicit self-corrections, instead of performing real-time, spontaneous self-corrections in a single pass. To address this, we propose SPOC, a spontaneous self-correction approach that enables LLMs to generate interleaved solutions and verifications in a single inference pass, with generation dynamically terminated based on verification outcomes, thereby effectively scaling inference time compute. SPOC considers a multi-agent perspective by assigning dual roles -- solution proposer and verifier -- to the same model. We adopt a simple yet effective approach to generate synthetic data for fine-tuning, enabling the model to develop capabilities for self-verification and multi-agent collaboration. We further improve its solution proposal and verification accuracy through online reinforcement learning. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that SPOC significantly improves performance. Notably, SPOC boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B and 70B Instruct models, achieving gains of 8.8% and 11.6% on MATH500, 10.0% and 20.0% on AMC23, and 3.3% and 6.7% on AIME24, respectively.

Abstract: Simulating society with large language models (LLMs), we argue, requires more than generating plausible behavior -- it demands cognitively grounded reasoning that is structured, revisable, and traceable. LLM-based agents are increasingly used to emulate individual and group behavior -- primarily through prompting and supervised fine-tuning. Yet they often lack internal coherence, causal reasoning, and belief traceability -- making them unreliable for analyzing how people reason, deliberate, or respond to interventions.
  To address this, we present a conceptual modeling paradigm, Generative Minds (GenMinds), which draws from cognitive science to support structured belief representations in generative agents. To evaluate such agents, we introduce the RECAP (REconstructing CAusal Paths) framework, a benchmark designed to assess reasoning fidelity via causal traceability, demographic grounding, and intervention consistency. These contributions advance a broader shift: from surface-level mimicry to generative agents that simulate thought -- not just language -- for social simulations.

Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are the most common model for decision making under uncertainty in the Machine Learning community. An MDP captures non-determinism, probabilistic uncertainty, and an explicit model of action. A Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent learns to act in an MDP by maximizing a utility function. This paper considers the problem of learning a decision policy that maximizes utility subject to satisfying a constraint expressed in deontic logic. In this setup, the utility captures the agent's mission - such as going quickly from A to B. The deontic formula represents (ethical, social, situational) constraints on how the agent might achieve its mission by prohibiting classes of behaviors. We use the logic of Expected Act Utilitarianism, a probabilistic stit logic that can be interpreted over controlled MDPs. We develop a variation on policy improvement, and show that it reaches a constrained local maximum of the mission utility. Given that in stit logic, an agent's duty is derived from value maximization, this can be seen as a way of acting to simultaneously maximize two value functions, one of which is implicit, in a bi-level structure. We illustrate these results with experiments on sample MDPs.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) agents automatically answer questions posed in natural language. In this work, we learn to ask clarifying questions in QA agents. The key idea in our method is to simulate conversations that contain clarifying questions and learn from them using reinforcement learning (RL). To make RL practical, we propose and analyze offline RL objectives that can be viewed as reward-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and easily optimized in large language models. Our work stands in a stark contrast to recently proposed methods, based on SFT and direct preference optimization, which have additional hyper-parameters and do not directly optimize rewards. We compare to these methods empirically and report gains in both optimized rewards and language quality.

Abstract: Motivated by an open direction in existing literature, we study the 1-identification problem, a fundamental multi-armed bandit formulation on pure exploration. The goal is to determine whether there exists an arm whose mean reward is at least a known threshold $\mu_0$, or to output None if it believes such an arm does not exist. The agent needs to guarantee its output is correct with probability at least $1-\delta$. Degenne & Koolen 2019 has established the asymptotically tight sample complexity for the 1-identification problem, but they commented that the non-asymptotic analysis remains unclear. We design a new algorithm Sequential-Exploration-Exploitation (SEE), and conduct theoretical analysis from the non-asymptotic perspective. Novel to the literature, we achieve near optimality, in the sense of matching upper and lower bounds on the pulling complexity. The gap between the upper and lower bounds is up to a polynomial logarithmic factor. The numerical result also indicates the effectiveness of our algorithm, compared to existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents -- particularly as task and agent sophistication increase -- requires more than simple comparison of reward curves, yet standard methods for behavioral analysis remain underdeveloped in DRL. We apply tools from neuroscience and ethology to study DRL agents in a novel, complex, partially observable environment, ForageWorld, designed to capture key aspects of real-world animal foraging -- including sparse, depleting resource patches, predator threats, and spatially extended arenas. We use this environment as a platform for applying joint behavioral and neural analysis to agents, revealing detailed, quantitatively grounded insights into agent strategies, memory, and planning. Contrary to common assumptions, we find that model-free RNN-based DRL agents can exhibit structured, planning-like behavior purely through emergent dynamics -- without requiring explicit memory modules or world models. Our results show that studying DRL agents like animals -- analyzing them with neuroethology-inspired tools that reveal structure in both behavior and neural dynamics -- uncovers rich structure in their learning dynamics that would otherwise remain invisible. We distill these tools into a general analysis framework linking core behavioral and representational features to diagnostic methods, which can be reused for a wide range of tasks and agents. As agents grow more complex and autonomous, bridging neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI will be essential -- not just for understanding their behavior, but for ensuring safe alignment and maximizing desirable behaviors that are hard to measure via reward. We show how this can be done by drawing on lessons from how biological intelligence is studied.

Existing benchmarks for video question answering remain limited in scope, typically involving one clip per query, which falls short of representing the challenges of large-scale, audio-visual retrieval and reasoning encountered in practical applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task named AV-HaystacksQA, where the goal is to identify salient segments across different videos in response to a query and link them together to generate the most informative answer. To this end, we present AVHaystacks, an audio-visual benchmark comprising 3100 annotated QA pairs designed to assess the capabilities of LMMs in multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding task. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic, multi-agent framework MAGNET to address this challenge, achieving up to 89% and 65% relative improvements over baseline methods on BLEU@4 and GPT evaluation scores in QA task on our proposed AVHaystacks. To enable robust evaluation of multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding for optimal response generation, we introduce two new metrics, STEM, which captures alignment errors between a ground truth and a predicted step sequence and MTGS, to facilitate balanced and interpretable evaluation of segment-level grounding performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has outperformed other counterparts in sequential decision-making and dynamic environment control. However, FPGA deployment is significantly resource-expensive, as associated with large number of computations in training agents with high-quality images and possess new challenges. In this work, we propose QForce-RL takes benefits of quantization to enhance throughput and reduce energy footprint with light-weight RL architecture, without significant performance degradation. QForce-RL takes advantages from E2HRL to reduce overall RL actions to learn desired policy and QuaRL for quantization based SIMD for hardware acceleration. We have also provided detailed analysis for different RL environments, with emphasis on model size, parameters, and accelerated compute ops. The architecture is scalable for resource-constrained devices and provide parametrized efficient deployment with flexibility in latency, throughput, power, and energy efficiency. The proposed QForce-RL provides performance enhancement up to 2.3x and better FPS - 2.6x compared to SoTA works.

Abstract: We introduce Layered Self-Supervised Knowledge Distillation (LSSKD) framework for training compact deep learning models. Unlike traditional methods that rely on pre-trained teacher networks, our approach appends auxiliary classifiers to intermediate feature maps, generating diverse self-supervised knowledge and enabling one-to-one transfer across different network stages. Our method achieves an average improvement of 4.54\% over the state-of-the-art PS-KD method and a 1.14% gain over SSKD on CIFAR-100, with a 0.32% improvement on ImageNet compared to HASSKD. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and CIFAR-100 under few-shot learning scenarios also achieve state-of-the-art results. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing model generalization and performance without the need for large over-parameterized teacher networks. Importantly, at the inference stage, all auxiliary classifiers can be removed, yielding no extra computational cost. This makes our model suitable for deploying small language models on affordable low-computing devices. Owing to its lightweight design and adaptability, our framework is particularly suitable for multimodal sensing and cyber-physical environments that require efficient and responsive inference. LSSKD facilitates the development of intelligent agents capable of learning from limited sensory data under weak supervision.

<title>On the Generalization of Data-Assisted Control in port-Hamiltonian Systems (DAC-pH)</title>

arXiv:2506.07079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hypothetical hybrid control framework for port-Hamiltonian (p$\mathcal{H}$) systems, employing a dynamic decomposition based on Data-Assisted Control (DAC). The system's evolution is split into two parts with fixed topology: Right-Hand Side (RHS)- an intrinsic Hamiltonian flow handling worst-case parametric uncertainties, and Left-Hand Side (LHS)- a dissipative/input flow addressing both structural and parametric uncertainties. A virtual port variable $\Pi$ serves as the interface between these two components. A nonlinear controller manages the intrinsic Hamiltonian flow, determining a desired port control value $\Pi_c$. Concurrently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is applied to the dissipative/input flow to learn an agent for providing optimal policy in mapping $\Pi_c$ to the actual system input. This hybrid approach effectively manages RHS uncertainties while preserving the system's inherent structure. Key advantages include adjustable performance via LHS controller parameters, enhanced AI explainability and interpretability through the port variable $\Pi$, the ability to guarantee safety and state attainability with hard/soft constraints, reduced complexity in learning hypothesis classes compared to end-to-end solutions, and improved state/parameter estimation using LHS prior knowledge and system Hamiltonian to address partial observability. The paper details the p$\mathcal{H}$ formulation, derives the decomposition, and presents the modular controller architecture. Beyond design, crucial aspects of stability and robustness analysis and synthesis are investigated, paving the way for deeper theoretical investigations. An application example, a pendulum with nonlinear dynamics, is simulated to demonstrate the approach's empirical and phenomenological benefits for future research.

Abstract: Decentralized optimization is crucial for multi-agent systems, with significant concerns about communication efficiency and privacy. This paper explores the role of efficient communication in decentralized stochastic gradient descent algorithms for enhancing privacy preservation. We develop a novel algorithm that incorporates two key features: random agent activation and sparsified communication. Utilizing differential privacy, we demonstrate that these features reduce noise without sacrificing privacy, thereby amplifying the privacy guarantee and improving accuracy. Additionally, we analyze the convergence and the privacy-accuracy-communication trade-off of the proposed algorithm. Finally, we present experimental results to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural language reasoning tasks, yet their reasoning processes remain brittle and difficult to interpret. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enhance reliability by eliciting intermediate reasoning steps or aggregating multiple outputs. However, they lack mechanisms for enforcing logical structure and assessing internal coherence. We introduce Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh), a novel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three parallel agents, each simulating a distinct mode of inference: abductive, deductive, and inductive. Each agent produces a reasoning trace, which is structured into a formal reasoning graph. To evaluate consistency, we apply Bayesian belief propagation guided by natural language inference (NLI), assigning confidence scores to each step. The most coherent graph is selected to derive the final answer. Experiments on symbolic (WebOfLies) and numerical (MultiArith) reasoning benchmarks show that ToTh consistently outperforms CoT, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding across multiple LLMs, while producing interpretable and logically grounded reasoning chains. Our findings suggest a promising direction for building more robust and cognitively inspired LLM reasoning. The implementation is available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/theorem-of-thought.

<title>BRIGHT+: Upgrading the BRIGHT Benchmark with MARCUS, a Multi-Agent RAG Clean-Up Suite</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require corpora that are both structurally clean and semantically coherent. BRIGHT is a recent and influential benchmark designed to evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across diverse, high-reasoning domains. However, its practical effectiveness is limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such as content redundancy and semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy and downstream reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in seven StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean.
  In this study, we present MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies dedicated agents for structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of retrievers. We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to support future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.

Abstract: Web-use agents are rapidly being deployed to automate complex web tasks, operating with extensive browser capabilities including multi-tab navigation, DOM manipulation, JavaScript execution and authenticated session access. However, these powerful capabilities create a critical and previously unexplored attack surface. This paper demonstrates how attackers can exploit web-use agents' high-privilege capabilities by embedding malicious content in web pages such as comments, reviews, or advertisements that agents encounter during legitimate browsing tasks. In addition, we introduce the task-aligned injection technique that frame malicious commands as helpful task guidance rather than obvious attacks. This technique exploiting fundamental limitations in LLMs' contextual reasoning: agents struggle in maintaining coherent contextual awareness and fail to detect when seemingly helpful web content contains steering attempts that deviate from their original task goal. Through systematic evaluation of four popular agents (OpenAI Operator, Browser Use, Do Browser, OpenOperator), we demonstrate nine payload types that compromise confidentiality, integrity, and availability, including unauthorized camera activation, user impersonation, local file exfiltration, password leakage, and denial of service, with validation across multiple LLMs achieving success rates of 80%-100%. These payloads succeed across agents with built-in safety mechanisms, requiring only the ability to post content on public websites, creating unprecedented risks given the ease of exploitation combined with agents' high-privilege access. To address this attack, we propose comprehensive mitigation strategies including oversight mechanisms, execution constraints, and task-aware reasoning techniques, providing practical directions for secure development and deployment.

<title>Delegation with Costly Inspection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07162</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of delegated choice with inspection cost (DCIC), which is a variant of the delegated choice problem by Kleinberg and Kleinberg (EC'18) as well as an extension of the Pandora's box problem with nonobligatory inspection (PNOI) by Doval (JET'18). In our model, an agent may strategically misreport the proposed element's utility, unlike the standard delegated choice problem which assumes that the agent truthfully reports the utility for the proposed alternative. Thus, the principal needs to inspect the proposed element possibly along with other alternatives to maximize its own utility, given an exogenous cost of inspecting each element. Further, the delegation itself incurs a fixed cost, thus the principal can decide whether to delegate or not and inspect by herself.
  We show that DCIC indeed is a generalization of PNOI where the side information from a strategic agent is available at certain cost, implying its NP-hardness by Fu, Li, and Liu (STOC'23). We first consider a costless delegation setting in which the cost of delegation is free. We prove that the maximal mechanism over the pure delegation with a single inspection and an PNOI policy without delegation achieves a $3$-approximation for DCIC with costless delegation, which is further proven to be tight. These results hold even when the cost comes from an arbitrary monotone set function, and can be improved to a $2$-approximation if the cost of inspection is the same for every element. We extend these techniques by presenting a constant factor approximate mechanism for the general setting for rich class of instances.

<title>Value-Set Iteration: Computing Optimal Correlated Equilibria in Infinite-Horizon Multi-Player Stochastic Games</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of computing optimal correlated equilibria (CEs) in infinite-horizon multi-player stochastic games, where correlation signals are provided over time. In this setting, optimal CEs require history-dependent policies; this poses new representational and algorithmic challenges as the number of possible histories grows exponentially with the number of time steps. We focus on computing $(\epsilon, \delta)$-optimal CEs -- solutions that achieve a value within $\epsilon$ of an optimal CE, while allowing the agents' incentive constraints to be violated by at most $\delta$. Our main result is an algorithm that computes an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-optimal CE in time polynomial in $1/(\epsilon\delta(1 - \gamma))^{n+1}$, where $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $n$ is the number of agents. For (a slightly more general variant of) turn-based games, we further reduce the complexity to a polynomial in $n$. We also establish that the bi-criterion approximation is necessary by proving matching inapproximability bounds.
  Our technical core is a novel approach based on inducible value sets, which leverages a compact representation of history-dependent CEs through the values they induce to overcome the representational challenge. We develop the value-set iteration algorithm -- which operates by iteratively updating estimates of inducible value sets -- and characterize CEs as the greatest fixed point of the update map. Our algorithm provides a groundwork for computing optimal CEs in general multi-player stochastic settings.

Abstract: This study investigates effective strategies for developing a customised GPT agent to code classroom dialogue. While classroom dialogue is widely recognised as a crucial element of education, its analysis remains challenging due to the need for a nuanced understanding of dialogic functions and the labour-intensive nature of manual transcript coding. Recent advancements in large language models offer promising avenues for automating this process. However, existing studies predominantly focus on training large-scale models or evaluating pre-trained models with fixed codebooks, which are often not applicable or replicable for dialogue researchers working with small datasets or customised coding schemes. Using GPT-4's MyGPT agent as a case, this study evaluates its baseline performance in coding classroom dialogue with a human codebook and examines how performance varies with different example inputs through a variable control method. Through a design-based research approach, it identifies a set of practical strategies, based on MyGPT's unique features, for configuring effective agents with limited data. The findings suggest that, despite some limitations, a MyGPT agent developed with these strategies can serve as a useful coding assistant by generating coding suggestions.

<title>Efficient RL-based Cache Vulnerability Exploration by Penalizing Useless Agent Actions</title>

Abstract: Cache-timing attacks exploit microarchitectural characteristics to leak sensitive data, posing a severe threat to modern systems. Despite its severity, analyzing the vulnerability of a given cache structure against cache-timing attacks is challenging. To this end, a method based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been proposed to automatically explore vulnerabilities for a given cache structure. However, a naive RL-based approach suffers from inefficiencies due to the agent performing actions that do not contribute to the exploration. In this paper, we propose a method to identify these useless actions during training and penalize them so that the agent avoids them and the exploration efficiency is improved. Experiments on 17 cache structures show that our training mechanism reduces the number of useless actions by up to 43.08%. This resulted in the reduction of training time by 28\% in the base case and 4.84\% in the geomean compared to a naive RL-based approach.

Abstract: Existing computer-use agents primarily focus on general-purpose desktop automation tasks, with limited exploration of their application in highly specialized domains. In particular, the 3D building modeling process in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector involves open-ended design tasks and complex interaction patterns within Building Information Modeling (BIM) authoring software, which has yet to be thoroughly addressed by current studies. In this paper, we propose BIMgent, an agentic framework powered by multimodal large language models (LLMs), designed to enable autonomous building model authoring via graphical user interface (GUI) operations. BIMgent automates the architectural building modeling process, including multimodal input for conceptual design, planning of software-specific workflows, and efficient execution of the authoring GUI actions. We evaluate BIMgent on real-world building modeling tasks, including both text-based conceptual design generation and reconstruction from existing building design. The design quality achieved by BIMgent was found to be reasonable. Its operations achieved a 32% success rate, whereas all baseline models failed to complete the tasks (0% success rate). Results demonstrate that BIMgent effectively reduces manual workload while preserving design intent, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in real-world architectural modeling scenarios.

Abstract: In the realm of embodied intelligence, the evolution of large language models (LLMs) has markedly enhanced agent decision making. Consequently, researchers have begun exploring agent performance in dynamically changing high-risk scenarios, i.e., fire, flood, and wind scenarios in the HAZARD benchmark. Under these extreme conditions, the delay in decision making emerges as a crucial yet insufficiently studied issue. We propose a Time Conversion Mechanism (TCM) that translates inference delays in decision-making into equivalent simulation frames, thus aligning cognitive and physical costs under a single FPS-based metric. By extending HAZARD with Respond Latency (RL) and Latency-to-Action Ratio (LAR), we deliver a fully latency-aware evaluation protocol. Moreover, we present the Rapid-Reflex Async-Reflect Agent (RRARA), which couples a lightweight LLM-guided feedback module with a rule-based agent to enable immediate reactive behaviors and asynchronous reflective refinements in situ. Experiments on HAZARD show that RRARA substantially outperforms existing baselines in latency-sensitive scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge bases and strong reasoning capabilities, making them promising tools for complex, multi-agent planning in embodied environments. However, despite LLMs' advanced abilities and the sophisticated modular design of agentic methods, existing LLM-based planning algorithms remain limited by weak adaptation capabilities to multi-agent embodied scenarios. We address this limitation by introducing a framework that enables LLM agents to learn and evolve both before and during test time, equipping them with environment-relevant knowledge for better planning and enhanced communication for improved cooperation. Inspired by centralized training with decentralized execution in multi-agent reinforcement learning, we propose a \textit{Learn as Individuals, Evolve as a Team (LIET)} paradigm for multi-agent LLMs adaptation. At the individual level, LLM agents learn a local utility function from exploratory datasets to better comprehend the embodied environment, which is then queried during test time to support informed decision-making. At the team level, LLM agents collaboratively and iteratively maintain and update a shared cooperation knowledge list based on new experiences, using it to guide more effective communication. By combining individual learning with team evolution, LIET enables comprehensive and flexible adaptation for LLM agents. Our experiments on Communicative Watch-And-Help and ThreeD-World Multi-Agent Transport benchmarks demonstrate that LIET, instantiated with both LLaMA and GPT-4o, outperforms existing baselines and exhibits strong cooperative planning abilities.

arXiv:2506.07270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in question answering and reasoning thanks to their extensive parametric memory. However, their knowledge is inherently limited by the scope of their pre-training data, while real-world information evolves continuously. Updating this knowledge typically requires costly and brittle re-training, or in-context learning (ICL), which becomes impractical at scale given the volume and volatility of modern information. Motivated by these limitations, we investigate how LLMs perform when exposed to temporal text corpora, or documents that reflect evolving knowledge over time, such as sports biographies where facts like a player's "current team" change year by year. To this end, we introduce two new benchmarks: Temporal Wiki, which captures factual drift across historical Wikipedia snapshots, and Unified Clark, which aggregates timestamped news articles to simulate real-world information accumulation. Our analysis reveals that LLMs often struggle to reconcile conflicting or outdated facts and can be misled when multiple versions of a fact appear in context. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight, agentic framework that incrementally builds a structured, external memory from source documents without requiring re-training. This knowledge organization strategy enables models to retrieve and reason over temporally filtered, relevant information at inference time. Empirically, our method outperforms ICL and RAG baselines across both benchmarks, especially on questions requiring more complex reasoning or integration of conflicting facts.

Abstract: Modern data marketplaces and data sharing consortia increasingly rely on incentive mechanisms to encourage agents to contribute data. However, schemes that reward agents based on the quantity of submitted data are vulnerable to manipulation, as agents may submit fabricated or low-quality data to inflate their rewards. Prior work has proposed comparing each agent's data against others' to promote honesty: when others contribute genuine data, the best way to minimize discrepancy is to do the same. Yet prior implementations of this idea rely on very strong assumptions about the data distribution (e.g. Gaussian), limiting their applicability. In this work, we develop reward mechanisms based on a novel, two-sample test inspired by the Cram\'er-von Mises statistic. Our methods strictly incentivize agents to submit more genuine data, while disincentivizing data fabrication and other types of untruthful reporting. We establish that truthful reporting constitutes a (possibly approximate) Nash equilibrium in both Bayesian and prior-agnostic settings. We theoretically instantiate our method in three canonical data sharing problems and show that it relaxes key assumptions made by prior work. Empirically, we demonstrate that our mechanism incentivizes truthful data sharing via simulations and on real-world language and image data.

Abstract: As AI technologies become more human-facing, there have been numerous calls to adapt participatory approaches to AI development -- spurring the idea of participatory AI. However, these calls often focus only on primary stakeholders, such as end-users, and not secondary stakeholders. This paper seeks to translate the ideals of participatory AI to a broader population of secondary AI stakeholders through semi-structured interviews. We theorize that meaningful participation involves three participatory ideals: (1) informedness, (2) consent, and (3) agency. We also explore how secondary stakeholders realize these ideals by traversing a complicated problem space. Like walking up the rungs of a ladder, these ideals build on one another. We introduce three stakeholder archetypes: the reluctant data contributor, the unsupported activist, and the well-intentioned practitioner, who must navigate systemic barriers to achieving agentic AI relationships. We envision an AI future where secondary stakeholders are able to meaningfully participate with the AI systems they influence and are influenced by.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable flexibility for solving inverse problems without task-specific retraining. However, existing approaches such as Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes. Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such as drones and mobile robots.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread success in code generation tasks for different scenarios, both everyday and professional. However current LLMs, despite producing functional code, do not prioritize security and may generate code with exploitable vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose techniques for generating code that is more likely to be secure and introduce SCGAgent, a proactive secure coding agent that implements our techniques. We use security coding guidelines that articulate safe programming practices, combined with LLM-generated unit tests to preserve functional correctness. In our evaluation, we find that SCGAgent is able to preserve nearly 98% of the functionality of the base Sonnet-3.7 LLM while achieving an approximately 25% improvement in security. Moreover, SCGAgent is able to match or best the performance of sophisticated reasoning LLMs using a non-reasoning model and an agentic workflow.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern manufacturing, coupled with demand fluctuation, supply chain uncertainties, and product customization, underscores the need for manufacturing systems that can flexibly update their configurations and swiftly adapt to disturbances. However, current research falls short in providing a holistic reconfigurable manufacturing framework that seamlessly monitors system disturbances, optimizes alternative line configurations based on machine capabilities, and automates simulation evaluation for swift adaptations. This paper presents a dynamic manufacturing line reconfiguration framework to handle disturbances that result in operation time changes. The framework incorporates a system process digital twin for monitoring disturbances and triggering reconfigurations, a capability-based ontology model capturing available agent and resource options, a configuration optimizer generating optimal line configurations, and a simulation generation program initializing simulation setups and evaluating line configurations at approximately 400x real-time speed. A case study of a battery production line has been conducted to evaluate the proposed framework. In two implemented disturbance scenarios, the framework successfully recovers system throughput with limited resources, preventing the 26% and 63% throughput drops that would have occurred without a reconfiguration plan. The reconfiguration optimizer efficiently finds optimal solutions, taking an average of 0.03 seconds to find a reconfiguration plan for a manufacturing line with 51 operations and 40 available agents across 8 agent types.

<title>Hierarchical Scoring with 3D Gaussian Splatting for Instance Image-Goal Navigation</title>

Abstract: Instance Image-Goal Navigation (IIN) requires autonomous agents to identify and navigate to a target object or location depicted in a reference image captured from any viewpoint. While recent methods leverage powerful novel view synthesis (NVS) techniques, such as three-dimensional Gaussian splatting (3DGS), they typically rely on randomly sampling multiple viewpoints or trajectories to ensure comprehensive coverage of discriminative visual cues. This approach, however, creates significant redundancy through overlapping image samples and lacks principled view selection, substantially increasing both rendering and comparison overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel IIN framework with a hierarchical scoring paradigm that estimates optimal viewpoints for target matching. Our approach integrates cross-level semantic scoring, utilizing CLIP-derived relevancy fields to identify regions with high semantic similarity to the target object class, with fine-grained local geometric scoring that performs precise pose estimation within promising regions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated IIN benchmarks and real-world applicability.

<title>Distributed Risk-Sensitive Safety Filters for Uncertain Discrete-Time Systems</title>

Abstract: Ensuring safety in multi-agent systems is a significant challenge, particularly in settings where centralized coordination is impractical. In this work, we propose a novel risk-sensitive safety filter for discrete-time multi-agent systems with uncertain dynamics that leverages control barrier functions (CBFs) defined through value functions. Our approach relies on centralized risk-sensitive safety conditions based on exponential risk operators to ensure robustness against model uncertainties. We introduce a distributed formulation of the safety filter by deriving two alternative strategies: one based on worst-case anticipation and another on proximity to a known safe policy. By allowing agents to switch between strategies, feasibility can be ensured. Through detailed numerical evaluations, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in maintaining safety without being overly conservative.

Abstract: Spatial awareness is a critical capability for embodied agents, as it enables them to anticipate and reason about unobserved regions. The primary challenge arises from learning the distribution of indoor semantics, complicated by sparse, imbalanced object categories and diverse spatial scales. Existing methods struggle to robustly generate unobserved areas in real time and do not generalize well to new environments. To this end, we propose \textbf{MapBERT}, a novel framework designed to effectively model the distribution of unseen spaces. Motivated by the observation that the one-hot encoding of semantic maps aligns naturally with the binary structure of bit encoding, we, for the first time, leverage a lookup-free BitVAE to encode semantic maps into compact bitwise tokens. Building on this, a masked transformer is employed to infer missing regions and generate complete semantic maps from limited observations. To enhance object-centric reasoning, we propose an object-aware masking strategy that masks entire object categories concurrently and pairs them with learnable embeddings, capturing implicit relationships between object embeddings and spatial tokens. By learning these relationships, the model more effectively captures indoor semantic distributions crucial for practical robotic tasks. Experiments on Gibson benchmarks show that MapBERT achieves state-of-the-art semantic map generation, balancing computational efficiency with accurate reconstruction of unobserved regions.

<title>Extended Version of "Distributed Adaptive Resilient Consensus Control for Uncertain Nonlinear Multiagent Systems Against Deception Attacks"</title>

Abstract: This paper studies distributed resilient consensus problem for a class of uncertain nonlinear multiagent systems susceptible to deception attacks. The attacks invade both sensor and actuator channels of each agent. A specific class of Nussbaum functions is adopted to manage the attack-incurred multiple unknown control directions. Additionally, a general form of these Nussbaum functions is provided, which helps to ease the degeneration of output performance caused by Nussbaum gains. Then, by introducing finite-time distributed reference systems and local-error-based dynamic gains, we propose a novel distributed adaptive backstepping-based resilient consensus control strategy. We prove that all the closed-loop signals are uniformly bounded under attacks, and output consensus errors converge in finite time to a clearly-defined residual set whose size can be reduced by tuning control parameters, which is superior to existing results. Simulation results display the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.

<title>Shapley-Coop: Credit Assignment for Emergent Cooperation in Self-Interested LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong collaborative performance in multi-agent systems with predefined roles and workflows. However, in open-ended environments lacking coordination rules, agents tend to act in self-interested ways. The central challenge in achieving coordination lies in credit assignment -- fairly evaluating each agent's contribution and designing pricing mechanisms that align their heterogeneous goals. This problem is critical as LLMs increasingly participate in complex human-AI collaborations, where fair compensation and accountability rely on effective pricing mechanisms. Inspired by how human societies address similar coordination challenges (e.g., through temporary collaborations such as employment or subcontracting), we propose a cooperative workflow, Shapley-Coop. Shapley-Coop integrates Shapley Chain-of-Thought -- leveraging marginal contributions as a principled basis for pricing -- with structured negotiation protocols for effective price matching, enabling LLM agents to coordinate through rational task-time pricing and post-task reward redistribution. This approach aligns agent incentives, fosters cooperation, and maintains autonomy. We evaluate Shapley-Coop across two multi-agent games and a software engineering simulation, demonstrating that it consistently enhances LLM agent collaboration and facilitates equitable credit assignment. These results highlight the effectiveness of Shapley-Coop's pricing mechanisms in accurately reflecting individual contributions during task execution.

<title>From Static to Adaptive Defense: Federated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning-Driven Moving Target Defense Against DoS Attacks in UAV Swarm Networks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07392</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07392</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms has enabled a wide range of mission-critical applications, but also exposes UAV networks to severe Denial-of-Service (DoS) threats due to their open wireless environment, dynamic topology, and resource constraints. Traditional static or centralized defense mechanisms are often inadequate for such dynamic and distributed scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework for proactive and adaptive DoS mitigation in UAV swarm networks. Specifically, we design three lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader switching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, that leverage the inherent flexibility of UAV swarms to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network resilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the distributed, resource-constrained, and uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV is equipped with a local policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions based on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy gradient-based FMADRL algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their defense policies via reward-weighted aggregation, enabling distributed learning without sharing raw data and thus reducing communication overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack mitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and decreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%, respectively, while maintaining robust mission continuity under various DoS attack strategies.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have demonstrated cognitive and execution capabilities that far exceed those of single LLM agents, yet their capacity for self-evolution remains hampered by underdeveloped memory architectures. Upon close inspection, we are alarmed to discover that prevailing MAS memory mechanisms (1) are overly simplistic, completely disregarding the nuanced inter-agent collaboration trajectories, and (2) lack cross-trial and agent-specific customization, in stark contrast to the expressive memory developed for single agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce G-Memory, a hierarchical, agentic memory system for MAS inspired by organizational memory theory, which manages the lengthy MAS interaction via a three-tier graph hierarchy: insight, query, and interaction graphs. Upon receiving a new user query, G-Memory performs bi-directional memory traversal to retrieve both $\textit{high-level, generalizable insights}$ that enable the system to leverage cross-trial knowledge, and $\textit{fine-grained, condensed interaction trajectories}$ that compactly encode prior collaboration experiences. Upon task execution, the entire hierarchy evolves by assimilating new collaborative trajectories, nurturing the progressive evolution of agent teams. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, three LLM backbones, and three popular MAS frameworks demonstrate that G-Memory improves success rates in embodied action and accuracy in knowledge QA by up to $20.89\%$ and $10.12\%$, respectively, without any modifications to the original frameworks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/bingreeky/GMemory.

Abstract: The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational use.

<title>Generate Realistic Test Scenes for V2X Communication Systems</title>

Abstract: Accurately perceiving complex driving environments is essential for ensuring the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. With the tremendous progress in deep learning and communication technologies, cooperative perception with Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies has emerged as a solution to overcome the limitations of single-agent perception systems in perceiving distant objects and occlusions. Despite the considerable advancements, V2X cooperative perception systems require thorough testing and continuous enhancement of system performance. Given that V2X driving scenes entail intricate communications with multiple vehicles across various geographic locations, creating V2X test scenes for these systems poses a significant challenge. Moreover, current testing methodologies rely on manual data collection and labeling, which are both time-consuming and costly.
  In this paper, we design and implement V2XGen, an automated testing generation tool for V2X cooperative perception systems. V2XGen utilizes a high-fidelity approach to generate realistic cooperative object instances and strategically place them within the background data in crucial positions. Furthermore, V2XGen adopts a fitness-guided V2X scene generation strategy for the transformed scene generation process and improves testing efficiency. We conduct experiments on V2XGen using multiple cooperative perception systems with different fusion schemes to assess its performance on various tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that V2XGen is capable of generating realistic test scenes and effectively detecting erroneous behaviors in different V2X-oriented driving conditions. Furthermore, the results validate that retraining systems under test with the generated scenes can enhance average detection precision while reducing occlusion and long-range perception errors.

Abstract: A major bottleneck in the training process for Zero-Shot Coordination (ZSC) agents is the generation of partner agents that are diverse in collaborative conventions. Current Cross-play Minimization (XPM) methods for population generation can be very computationally expensive and sample inefficient as the training objective requires sampling multiple types of trajectories. Each partner agent in the population is also trained from scratch, despite all of the partners in the population learning policies of the same coordination task. In this work, we propose that simulated trajectories from the dynamics model of an environment can drastically speed up the training process for XPM methods. We introduce XPM-WM, a framework for generating simulated trajectories for XPM via a learned World Model (WM). We show XPM with simulated trajectories removes the need to sample multiple trajectories. In addition, we show our proposed method can effectively generate partners with diverse conventions that match the performance of previous methods in terms of SP population training reward as well as training partners for ZSC agents. Our method is thus, significantly more sample efficient and scalable to a larger number of partners.

<title>Chasing Moving Targets with Online Self-Play Reinforcement Learning for Safer Language Models</title>

Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive, disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input. Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic and physical artificial intelligence (AI) have largely focused on ground-based platforms such as humanoid and wheeled robots, leaving aerial robots relatively underexplored. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multimodal vision-language systems typically rely on closed-source models accessible only to well-resourced organizations. To democratize natural language control of autonomous drones, we present an open-source agentic framework that integrates PX4-based flight control, Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) middleware, and locally hosted models using Ollama. We evaluate performance both in simulation and on a custom quadcopter platform, benchmarking four large language model (LLM) families for command generation and three vision-language model (VLM) families for scene understanding.

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to automate real-world tasks by invoking APIs through natural language instructions. While powerful, they often suffer from misinterpretation of user intent, leading to the agent's actions that diverge from the user's intended goal, especially as external toolkits evolve. Traditional software testing assumes structured inputs and thus falls short in handling the ambiguity of natural language. We introduce IntenTest, an API-centric stress testing framework that systematically uncovers intent integrity violations in LLM agents. Unlike prior work focused on fixed benchmarks or adversarial inputs, IntenTest generates realistic tasks based on toolkits' documentation and applies targeted mutations to expose subtle agent errors while preserving user intent. To guide testing, we propose semantic partitioning, which organizes natural language tasks into meaningful categories based on toolkit API parameters and their equivalence classes. Within each partition, seed tasks are mutated and ranked by a lightweight predictor that estimates the likelihood of triggering agent errors. To enhance efficiency, IntenTest maintains a datatype-aware strategy memory that retrieves and adapts effective mutation patterns from past cases. Experiments on 80 toolkit APIs demonstrate that IntenTest effectively uncovers intent integrity violations, significantly outperforming baselines in both error-exposing rate and query efficiency. Moreover, IntenTest generalizes well to stronger target models using smaller LLMs for test generation, and adapts to evolving APIs across domains.

<title>Coordinating Search-Informed Reasoning and Reasoning-Guided Search in Claim Verification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-hop claim verification is inherently challenging, requiring multi-step reasoning to construct verification chains while iteratively searching for information to uncover hidden bridging facts. This process is fundamentally interleaved, as effective reasoning relies on dynamically retrieved evidence, while effective search demands reasoning to refine queries based on partial information. To achieve this, we propose Hierarchical Agent Reasoning and Information Search (HARIS), explicitly modeling the coordinated process of reasoning-driven searching and search-informed reasoning. HARIS consists of a high-level reasoning agent that focuses on constructing the main verification chain, generating factual questions when more information is needed, and a low-level search agent that iteratively retrieves more information, refining its search based on intermediate findings. This design allows each agent to specialize in its respective task, enhancing verification accuracy and interpretability. HARIS is trained using reinforcement learning with outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on the EX-FEVER and HOVER benchmarks demonstrate that HARIS achieves strong performance, greatly advancing multi-hop claim verification.

<title>Fractional Collisions: A Framework for Risk Estimation of Counterfactual Conflicts using Autonomous Driving Behavior Simulations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a methodology for estimating collision risk from counterfactual simulated scenarios built on sensor data from automated driving systems (ADS) or naturalistic driving databases. Two-agent conflicts are assessed by detecting and classifying conflict type, identifying the agents' roles (initiator or responder), identifying the point of reaction of the responder, and modeling their human behavioral expectations as probabilistic counterfactual trajectories. The states are used to compute velocity differentials at collision, which when combined with crash models, estimates severity of loss in terms of probabilistic injury or property damage, henceforth called fractional collisions. The probabilistic models may also be extended to include other uncertainties associated with the simulation, features, and agents. We verify the effectiveness of the methodology in a synthetic simulation environment using reconstructed trajectories from 300+ collision and near-collision scenes sourced from VTTI's SHRP2 database and Nexar dashboard camera data. Our methodology predicted fractional collisions within 1% of ground truth collisions. We then evaluate agent-initiated collision risk of an arbitrary ADS software release by replacing the naturalistic responder in these synthetic reconstructions with an ADS simulator and comparing the outcome to human-response outcomes. Our ADS reduced naturalistic collisions by 4x and fractional collision risk by ~62%. The framework's utility is also demonstrated on 250k miles of proprietary, open-loop sensor data collected on ADS test vehicles, re-simulated with an arbitrary ADS software release. The ADS initiated conflicts that caused 0.4 injury-causing and 1.7 property-damaging fractional collisions, and the ADS improved collision risk in 96% of the agent-initiated conflicts.

<title>Curriculum Learning With Counterfactual Group Relative Policy Advantage For Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved strong performance in cooperative adversarial tasks. However, most existing methods typically train agents against fixed opponent strategies and rely on such meta-static difficulty conditions, which limits their adaptability to changing environments and often leads to suboptimal policies. Inspired by the success of curriculum learning (CL) in supervised tasks, we propose a dynamic CL framework for MARL that employs an self-adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism. This mechanism continuously modulates opponent strength based on real-time agent training performance, allowing agents to progressively learn from easier to more challenging scenarios. However, the dynamic nature of CL introduces instability due to nonstationary environments and sparse global rewards. To address this challenge, we develop a Counterfactual Group Relative Policy Advantage (CGRPA), which is tightly coupled with the curriculum by providing intrinsic credit signals that reflect each agent's impact under evolving task demands. CGRPA constructs a counterfactual advantage function that isolates individual contributions within group behavior, facilitating more reliable policy updates throughout the curriculum. CGRPA evaluates each agent's contribution through constructing counterfactual action advantage function, providing intrinsic rewards that enhance credit assignment and stabilize learning under non-stationary conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method improves both training stability and final performance, achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/CL2MARL-SMAC.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising capabilities in chemistry tasks while still facing challenges due to outdated pretraining knowledge and the difficulty of incorporating specialized chemical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an LLM-based agent that synergistically integrates 137 external chemical tools created ranging from basic information retrieval to complex reaction predictions, and a dataset curation pipeline to generate the dataset ChemToolBench that facilitates both effective tool selection and precise parameter filling during fine-tuning and evaluation. We introduce a Hierarchical Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (HE-MCTS) framework, enabling independent optimization of tool planning and execution. By leveraging self-generated data, our approach supports step-level fine-tuning (FT) of the policy model and training task-adaptive PRM and ORM that surpass GPT-4o. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly improves performance in Chemistry QA and discovery tasks, offering a robust solution to integrate specialized tools with LLMs for advanced chemical applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC), precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of reliable autonomy.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the large language models (LLMs), their application to machine translation is relatively underexplored, especially in context-aware settings. This work presents a literature review of context-aware translation with LLMs. The existing works utilise prompting and fine-tuning approaches, with few focusing on automatic post-editing and creating translation agents for context-aware machine translation. We observed that the commercial LLMs (such as ChatGPT and Tower LLM) achieved better results than the open-source LLMs (such as Llama and Bloom LLMs), and prompt-based approaches serve as good baselines to assess the quality of translations. Finally, we present some interesting future directions to explore.

Abstract: The dual use nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a growing challenge in cybersecurity. While LLM enhances automation and reasoning for defenders, they also introduce new risks, particularly their potential to be misused for generating evasive, AI crafted malware. Despite this emerging threat, the research community currently lacks controlled and extensible tools that can simulate such behavior for testing and defense preparation. We present MalGEN, a multi agent framework that simulates coordinated adversarial behavior to generate diverse, activity driven malware samples. The agents work collaboratively to emulate attacker workflows, including payload planning, capability selection, and evasion strategies, within a controlled environment built for ethical and defensive research. Using MalGEN, we synthesized ten novel malware samples and evaluated them against leading antivirus and behavioral detection engines. Several samples exhibited stealthy and evasive characteristics that bypassed current defenses, validating MalGEN's ability to model sophisticated and new threats. By transforming the threat of LLM misuse into an opportunity for proactive defense, MalGEN offers a valuable framework for evaluating and strengthening cybersecurity systems. The framework addresses data scarcity, enables rigorous testing, and supports the development of resilient and future ready detection strategies.

<title>DragNeXt: Rethinking Drag-Based Image Editing</title>

Abstract: Drag-Based Image Editing (DBIE), which allows users to manipulate images by directly dragging objects within them, has recently attracted much attention from the community. However, it faces two key challenges: (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{i}}) point-based drag is often highly ambiguous and difficult to align with users' intentions; (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{ii}}) current DBIE methods primarily rely on alternating between motion supervision and point tracking, which is not only cumbersome but also fails to produce high-quality results. These limitations motivate us to explore DBIE from a new perspective -- redefining it as deformation, rotation, and translation of user-specified handle regions. Thereby, by requiring users to explicitly specify both drag areas and types, we can effectively address the ambiguity issue. Furthermore, we propose a simple-yet-effective editing framework, dubbed \textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}}. It unifies DBIE as a Latent Region Optimization (LRO) problem and solves it through Progressive Backward Self-Intervention (PBSI), simplifying the overall procedure of DBIE while further enhancing quality by fully leveraging region-level structure information and progressive guidance from intermediate drag states. We validate \textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}} on our NextBench, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly outperform existing approaches. Code will be released on github.

<title>Blending Participatory Design and Artificial Awareness for Trustworthy Autonomous Vehicles</title>

Abstract: Current robotic agents, such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and drones, need to deal with uncertain real-world environments with appropriate situational awareness (SA), risk awareness, coordination, and decision-making. The SymAware project strives to address this issue by designing an architecture for artificial awareness in multi-agent systems, enabling safe collaboration of autonomous vehicles and drones. However, these agents will also need to interact with human users (drivers, pedestrians, drone operators), which in turn requires an understanding of how to model the human in the interaction scenario, and how to foster trust and transparency between the agent and the human.
  In this work, we aim to create a data-driven model of a human driver to be integrated into our SA architecture, grounding our research in the principles of trustworthy human-agent interaction. To collect the data necessary for creating the model, we conducted a large-scale user-centered study on human-AV interaction, in which we investigate the interaction between the AV's transparency and the users' behavior.
  The contributions of this paper are twofold: First, we illustrate in detail our human-AV study and its findings, and second we present the resulting Markov chain models of the human driver computed from the study's data. Our results show that depending on the AV's transparency, the scenario's environment, and the users' demographics, we can obtain significant differences in the model's transitions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly from conversational problem solving to addressing real-world tasks involving tool use, such as software engineering (SWE). Recent LLM-powered toolkits, such as OpenAI Codex and Cursor, have offered end-to-end automation of the software development process. However, building effective SWE agents remains challenging due to the lack of high-quality training data and effective test cases. To address this issue, we present SWE-Dev, an SWE agent built upon open-source LLMs. First, we develop a robust pipeline to synthesize test cases for patch evaluation. Second, we scale up agent trajectories to construct the training data for building SWE-Dev. Experiments on the SWE-bench-Verified benchmark show that the SWE-Dev models can achieve top performance among all open SWE agents. Specifically, the success rates of the SWE-Dev 7B and 32B parameter models reach 23.4% and 36.6%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art open-source models. All code, models, and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/SWE-Dev.

<title>MCPWorld: A Unified Benchmarking Testbed for API, GUI, and Hybrid Computer Use Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07672</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (M)LLM-powered computer use agents (CUA) are emerging as a transformative technique to automate human-computer interaction. However, existing CUA benchmarks predominantly target GUI agents, whose evaluation methods are susceptible to UI changes and ignore function interactions exposed by application APIs, e.g., Model Context Protocol (MCP). To this end, we propose MCPWorld, the first automatic CUA testbed for API, GUI, and API-GUI hybrid agents. A key principle of MCPWorld is the use of "white-box apps", i.e., those with source code availability and can be revised/re-compiled as needed (e.g., adding MCP support), with two notable advantages:
  (1) It greatly broadens the design space of CUA, such as what and how the app features to be exposed/extracted as CUA-callable APIs.
  (2) It allows MCPWorld to programmatically verify task completion by directly monitoring application behavior through techniques like dynamic code instrumentation, offering robust, accurate CUA evaluation decoupled from specific agent implementations or UI states.
  Currently, MCPWorld includes 201 well curated and annotated user tasks, covering diversified use cases and difficulty levels. MCPWorld is also fully containerized with GPU acceleration support for flexible adoption on different OS/hardware environments. Our preliminary experiments, using a representative LLM-powered CUA framework, achieve 75.12% task completion accuracy, simultaneously providing initial evidence on the practical effectiveness of agent automation leveraging MCP. Overall, we anticipate MCPWorld to facilitate and standardize the benchmarking of next-generation computer use agents that can leverage rich external tools. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/SAAgent/MCPWorld.

<title>QUITE: A Query Rewrite System Beyond Rules with LLM Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07675</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that run more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite rules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance regressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query rewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite rules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques cannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts exhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and reasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL queries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly applying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address this issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based methods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite state machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and enhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we develop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate optimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection technique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive experiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over state-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior methods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.

<title>Delay Optimization in Remote ID-Based UAV Communication via BLE and Wi-Fi Switching</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07715</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remote identification (Remote ID) broadcast capability allows unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to exchange messages, which is a pivotal technology for inter-UAV communications. Although this capability enhances the operational visibility, low delay in Remote ID-based communications is critical for ensuring the efficiency and timeliness of multi-UAV operations in dynamic environments. To address this challenge, we first establish delay models for Remote ID communications by considering packet reception and collisions across both BLE 4 and Wi-Fi protocols. Building upon these models, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the long-term communication delay through adaptive protocol selection. Since the delay performance varies with the UAV density, we propose an adaptive BLE/Wi-Fi switching algorithm based on the multi-agent deep Q-network approach. Experimental results demonstrate that in dynamic-density scenarios, our strategy achieves 32.1% and 37.7% lower latency compared to static BLE 4 and Wi-Fi modes respectively.

Abstract: With multi-agent systems increasingly deployed autonomously at scale in complex environments, ensuring safety of the data-driven policies is critical. Control Barrier Functions have emerged as an effective tool for enforcing safety constraints, yet existing learning-based methods often lack in scalability, generalization and sampling efficiency as they overlook inherent geometric structures of the system. To address this gap, we introduce symmetries-infused distributed Control Barrier Functions, enforcing the satisfaction of intrinsic symmetries on learnable graph-based safety certificates. We theoretically motivate the need for equivariant parametrization of CBFs and policies, and propose a simple, yet efficient and adaptable methodology for constructing such equivariant group-modular networks via the compatible group actions. This approach encodes safety constraints in a distributed data-efficient manner, enabling zero-shot generalization to larger and denser swarms. Through extensive simulations on multi-robot navigation tasks, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of safety, scalability, and task success rates, highlighting the importance of embedding symmetries in safe distributed neural policies.

Abstract: The Common Model of Cognition (CMC) provides an abstract characterization of the structure and processing required by a cognitive architecture for human-like minds. We propose a unified approach to integrating metacognition within the CMC. We propose that metacognition involves reasoning over explicit representations of an agent's cognitive capabilities and processes in working memory. Our proposal exploits the existing cognitive capabilities of the CMC, making minimal extensions in the structure and information available within working memory. We provide examples of metacognition within our proposal.

<title>Decentralizing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Causal Information</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL (DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints, communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly expedite the learning process in DMARL.

<title>A distributed motion planning approach to cooperative underwater acoustic source tracking and pursuit</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of underwater acoustic source tracking and pursuit with a team of autonomous underwater vehicles. Producing distributed control strategies in an underwater sensor network is not trivial since communication is primarily acoustic, which makes it intermittent and often plagued with major difficulties. For this reason, we propose an optimization scheme based on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process for improving the performance of underwater mobile sensor networks, in which autonomous underwater vehicles (agents) play the role of moving nodes of a network. The key idea is to adjust the agents' guidance strategies to achieve coordinated motion planning, enabling optimal geometric configurations between the agents and the target to enhance tracking performance. Such a problem is cast as a multi-objective optimization problem that is solved through a receding horizon lookahead optimization scheme since we are interested in long-term tracking accuracy. The planning strategy is distributed using the sequential multi-agent decision-making paradigm to make the solving tractable since the optimization depends on the joint action domain. A distributed control framework has been implemented in a simulation environment to validate the proposed approach, which explicitly accounts for the major limitations imposed by acoustic communications.

<title>LUCIFER: Language Understanding and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dynamic environments, the rapid obsolescence of pre-existing environmental knowledge creates a gap between an agent's internal model and the evolving reality of its operational context. This disparity between prior and updated environmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous decision-making. To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain stakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time observation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and context-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a domain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making architecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) into a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex tasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each focused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike traditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER integrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring verbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence decision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived insights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration facilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration. We benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves exploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat, goal-conditioned policies. Our findings show the potential of context-driven decision-making, where autonomous systems leverage human contextual knowledge for operational success.

<title>Diffusion of Responsibility in Collective Decision Making</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07935</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07935</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term "diffusion of responsibility'' refers to situations in which multiple agents share responsibility for an outcome, obscuring individual accountability. This paper examines this frequently undesirable phenomenon in the context of collective decision-making mechanisms.
  The work shows that if a decision is made by two agents, then the only way to avoid diffusion of responsibility is for one agent to act as a "dictator'', making the decision unilaterally. In scenarios with more than two agents, any diffusion-free mechanism is an "elected dictatorship'' where the agents elect a single agent to make a unilateral decision.
  The technical results are obtained by defining a bisimulation of decision-making mechanisms, proving that bisimulation preserves responsibility-related properties, and establishing the results for a smallest bisimular mechanism.

arXiv:2506.07972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in reasoning and agent-based problem-solving, current evaluation methodologies fail to adequately assess their capabilities: existing benchmarks either rely on closed-ended questions prone to saturation and memorization, or subjective comparisons that lack consistency and rigor. In this work, we introduce HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology, exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning. To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in scientific and engineering domains.

<title>Thinking vs. Doing: Agents that Reason by Scaling Test-Time Interaction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07976</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning traces ("thinking" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that require interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before acting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new information from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this work, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of test-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable running rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic re-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling dimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even prompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task success on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI (Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths. Using a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data web agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI enables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively. Our results establish interaction scaling as a powerful, complementary axis to scaling per-step compute, offering new avenues for training adaptive agents.

<title>Realistic Urban Traffic Generator using Decentralized Federated Learning for the SUMO simulator</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realistic urban traffic simulation is essential for sustainable urban planning and the development of intelligent transportation systems. However, generating high-fidelity, time-varying traffic profiles that accurately reflect real-world conditions, especially in large-scale scenarios, remains a major challenge. Existing methods often suffer from limitations in accuracy, scalability, or raise privacy concerns due to centralized data processing. This work introduces DesRUTGe (Decentralized Realistic Urban Traffic Generator), a novel framework that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents with the SUMO simulator to generate realistic 24-hour traffic patterns. A key innovation of DesRUTGe is its use of Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL), wherein each traffic detector and its corresponding urban zone function as an independent learning node. These nodes train local DRL models using minimal historical data and collaboratively refine their performance by exchanging model parameters with selected peers (e.g., geographically adjacent zones), without requiring a central coordinator. Evaluated using real-world data from the city of Barcelona, DesRUTGe outperforms standard SUMO-based tools such as RouteSampler, as well as other centralized learning approaches, by delivering more accurate and privacy-preserving traffic pattern generation.

arXiv:2506.07982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for conversational AI agents simulate single-control environments, where only the AI agent can use tools to interact with the world, while the user remains a passive information provider. This differs from real-world scenarios like technical support, where users need to actively participate in modifying the state of the (shared) world. In order to address this gap, we introduce $\tau^2$-bench, with four key contributions:
  1) A novel Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a Dec-POMDP, where both agent and user make use of tools to act in a shared, dynamic environment that tests both agent coordination and communication,
  2) A compositional task generator that programmatically creates diverse, verifiable tasks from atomic components, ensuring domain coverage and controlled complexity,
  3) A reliable user simulator tightly coupled with the environment, whose behavior is constrained by tools and observable states, improving simulation fidelity,
  4) Fine-grained analysis of agent performance through multiple ablations including separating errors arising from reasoning vs communication/coordination.
  In particular, our experiments show significant performance drops when agents shift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting the challenges of guiding users. Overall, $\tau^2$-bench provides a controlled testbed for agents that must both reason effectively and guide user actions.

Abstract: The construction industry is characterized by both high physical and psychological risks, yet supports of mental health remain limited. While advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), offer promising solutions, their potential in construction remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we developed a conversational multi-agent system that addresses industry-specific challenges through an AI-driven approach integrated with domain knowledge. In parallel, it fulfills construction workers' basic psychological needs by enabling interactions with multiple agents, each has a distinct persona. This approach ensures that workers receive both practical problem-solving support and social engagement, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being. We evaluate its usability and effectiveness through a within-subjects user study with 12 participants. The results show that our system significantly outperforms the single-agent baseline, achieving improvements of 18% in usability, 40% in self-determination, 60% in social presence, and 60% in trust. These findings highlight the promise of LLM-driven AI systems in providing domain-specific support for construction workers.

Abstract: Large-scale video generative models can synthesize diverse and realistic visual content for dynamic world creation, but they often lack element-wise controllability, hindering their use in editing scenes and training embodied AI agents. We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability, minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in revolutionizing Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. However, existing GUI models mostly rely on learning from nearly error-free offline trajectories, thus lacking reflection and error recovery capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose GUI-Reflection, a novel framework that explicitly integrates self-reflection and error correction capabilities into end-to-end multimodal GUI models throughout dedicated training stages: GUI-specific pre-training, offline supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and online reflection tuning. GUI-reflection enables self-reflection behavior emergence with fully automated data generation and learning processes without requiring any human annotation. Specifically, 1) we first propose scalable data pipelines to automatically construct reflection and error correction data from existing successful trajectories. While existing GUI models mainly focus on grounding and UI understanding ability, we propose the GUI-Reflection Task Suite to learn and evaluate reflection-oriented abilities explicitly. 2) Furthermore, we built a diverse and efficient environment for online training and data collection of GUI models on mobile devices. 3) We also present an iterative online reflection tuning algorithm leveraging the proposed environment, enabling the model to continuously enhance its reflection and error correction abilities. Our framework equips GUI agents with self-reflection and correction capabilities, paving the way for more robust, adaptable, and intelligent GUI automation, with all data, models, environments, and tools to be released publicly.

Abstract: Model-free and reinforcement learning-based adaptive filtering methods are gaining traction for denoising in dynamic, non-stationary environments such as wireless signal channels. Traditional filters like LMS, RLS, Wiener, and Kalman are limited by assumptions of stationary or requiring complex fine-tuning or exact noise statistics or fixed models. This letter proposes an adaptive filtering framework using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a composite reward that balances SNR improvement, MSE reduction, and residual smoothness. Experiments on synthetic signals with various noise types show that our PPO agent generalizes beyond its training distribution, achieving real-time performance and outperforming classical filters. This work demonstrates the viability of policy-gradient reinforcement learning for robust, low-latency adaptive signal filtering.

Abstract: Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science, accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models (LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows, while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o. Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI systems to behave in increasingly human-like ways, exhibiting planning, adaptation, and social dynamics across increasingly diverse, interactive, and open-ended scenarios. These behaviors are not solely the product of the models' internal architecture, but emerge from their integration into agentic systems that operate within situated contexts, where goals, feedback, and interactions shape behavior over time. This shift calls for a new scientific lens: AI Agent Behavioral Science. Rather than focusing only on internal mechanisms, this paradigm emphasizes the systematic observation of behavior, design of interventions to test hypotheses, and theory-guided interpretation of how AI agents act, adapt, and interact over time. We systematize a growing body of research across individual, multi-agent, and human-agent interaction settings, and further demonstrate how this perspective informs responsible AI by treating fairness, safety, interpretability, accountability, and privacy as behavioral properties. By unifying recent findings and laying out future directions, we position AI Agent Behavioral Science as a necessary complement to traditional approaches, providing essential tools for understanding, evaluating, and governing the real-world behavior of increasingly autonomous AI systems.

<title>Improving choice model specification using reinforcement learning</title>

Abstract: Discrete choice modelling is a theory-driven modelling framework for understanding and forecasting choice behaviour. To obtain behavioural insights, modellers test several competing model specifications in their attempts to discover the 'true' data generation process. This trial-and-error process requires expertise, is time-consuming, and relies on subjective theoretical assumptions. Although metaheuristics have been proposed to assist choice modellers, they treat model specification as a classic optimisation problem, relying on static strategies, applying predefined rules, and neglecting outcomes from previous estimated models. As a result, current metaheuristics struggle to prioritise promising search regions, adapt exploration dynamically, and transfer knowledge to other modelling tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning-based framework where an 'agent' specifies models by estimating them and receiving rewards based on goodness-of-fit and parsimony. Results demonstrate the agent dynamically adapts its strategies to identify promising specifications across data generation processes, showing robustness and potential transferability, without prior domain knowledge.

<title>SiliCoN: Simultaneous Nuclei Segmentation and Color Normalization of Histological Images</title>

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images is an important task for automated computer-aided analysis of histological images, particularly in the presence of impermissible color variation in the color appearance of stained tissue images. While color normalization enables better nuclei segmentation, accurate segmentation of nuclei structures makes color normalization rather trivial. In this respect, the paper proposes a novel deep generative model for simultaneously segmenting nuclei structures and normalizing color appearance of stained histological images.This model judiciously integrates the merits of truncated normal distribution and spatial attention. The model assumes that the latent color appearance information, corresponding to a particular histological image, is independent of respective nuclei segmentation map as well as embedding map information. The disentangled representation makes the model generalizable and adaptable as the modification or loss in color appearance information cannot be able to affect the nuclei segmentation map as well as embedding information. Also, for dealing with the stain overlap of associated histochemical reagents, the prior for latent color appearance code is assumed to be a mixture of truncated normal distributions. The proposed model incorporates the concept of spatial attention for segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images. The performance of the proposed approach, along with a comparative analysis with related state-of-the-art algorithms, has been demonstrated on publicly available standard histological image data sets.

<title>Decentralized Optimization on Compact Submanifolds by Quantized Riemannian Gradient Tracking</title>

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of decentralized optimization on compact submanifolds, where a finite sum of smooth (possibly non-convex) local functions is minimized by $n$ agents forming an undirected and connected graph. However, the efficiency of distributed optimization is often hindered by communication bottlenecks. To mitigate this, we propose the Quantized Riemannian Gradient Tracking (Q-RGT) algorithm, where agents update their local variables using quantized gradients. The introduction of quantization noise allows our algorithm to bypass the constraints of the accurate Riemannian projection operator (such as retraction), further improving iterative efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to achieve an $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ convergence rate in the presence of quantization, matching the convergence rate of methods without quantization. Additionally, we explicitly derive lower bounds on decentralized consensus associated with a function of quantization levels. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Q-RGT performs comparably to non-quantized methods while reducing communication bottlenecks and computational overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements and have attracted significant efforts to develop LLMs into agents capable of executing intricate multi-step decision-making tasks beyond traditional NLP applications. Existing approaches to LLM-based decision-making predominantly build upon the manually-designed external performance metrics to guide the decision-making process. However, reliance on the external performance metrics as prior is problematic in real-world scenarios, where such prior may be unavailable, flawed, or even erroneous. For genuine autonomous decision making, it is imperative for the agent to develop its rationality from its posterior experiences to judge decisions independently. Central to the development of rationality is the construction of an internalized utility judgment, capable of assigning numerical utilities to each decision. This paper proposes RadAgent (Rational Decision-Making Agent), which fosters the development of its rationality through an iterative framework involving Experience Exploration and Utility Learning. Within this framework, Elo-based Utility Construction is devised to assign Elo scores to individual decision steps to judge their utilities via pairwise comparisons. Consequently, these Elo scores guide the decision-making process to derive optimal outcomes. Experimental results on the ToolBench dataset demonstrate RadAgent's superiority over baselines, achieving over 10% improvement in Pass Rate on diverse tasks. It offers higher-quality solutions and reduces costs (ChatGPT API calls), highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency.

<title>Fair Division with Allocator's Preference</title>

Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible resources among agents. Most prior work focuses on fairness and/or efficiency among agents. However, the allocator, as the resource owner, may also be involved in many scenarios (e.g., government resource allocation, heritage division, company personnel assignment, etc). The allocator inclines to obtain a fair or efficient allocation based on her preference over the items and to whom each item is allocated. We propose a model and study two problems: 1) Find an allocation fair to both agents and allocator; 2) Maximize allocator's efficiency under agents' fairness. We consider the two fundamental fairness criteria: envy-freeness and proportionality.
  For the first problem, we study the existence of an allocation that is envy-free up to $c$ goods (EF-$c$) or proportional up to $c$ goods (PROP-$c$) from both the agents' and the allocator's perspectives, called doubly EF-$c$ or doubly PROP-$c$. When the allocator's utility only depends on the items (not recipients), we prove that a doubly EF-$1$ allocation always exists. For the general setting where the allocator has a preference over the items and to whom each item is allocated, a doubly EF-$1$ allocation always exists for two agents, a doubly PROP-$2$ allocation always exists for personalized bi-valued valuations, and a doubly PROP-$O(\log n)$ allocation always exists.
  For the second problem, we give (in)approximability results with asymptotically tight bounds in most settings. When agents' valuations are binary, maximizing the allocator's social welfare while ensuring agents' fairness criteria of PROP-$c$ (with a general number of agents) and EF-$c$ (with a constant number of agents) are both polynomial-time solvable for any integer $c$. Strong inapproximability holds for most of the other settings (general valuations, EF-$c$, etc).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in traditional natural language processing tasks but struggle with problems that require complex domain-specific calculations or simulations. While equipping LLMs with external tools to build LLM-based agents can enhance their capabilities, existing approaches lack the flexibility to address diverse and ever-evolving user queries in open domains. Currently, there is also no existing dataset that evaluates LLMs on open-domain knowledge that requires tools to solve. To this end, we introduce OpenAct benchmark to evaluate the open-domain task-solving capability, which is built on human expert consultation and repositories in GitHub. It comprises 339 questions spanning 7 diverse domains that need to be solved with domain-specific methods. In our experiments, even state-of-the-art LLMs and LLM-based agents demonstrate unsatisfactory success rates, underscoring the need for a novel approach. Furthermore, we present OpenAgent, a novel LLM-based agent system that can tackle evolving queries in open domains through autonomously integrating specialized tools from GitHub. OpenAgent employs 1) a hierarchical framework where specialized agents handle specific tasks and can assign tasks to inferior agents, 2) a bi-level experience learning mechanism to learn from both humans' and its own experiences to tackle tool flaws. Experiments demonstrate its superior effectiveness and efficiency, which significantly outperforms baselines. Our data and code are open-source at https://github.com/OpenBMB/OpenAct.

Abstract: We study a matching problem between agents and public goods, in settings without monetary transfers. Since goods are public, they have no capacity constraints. There is no exogenously defined budget of goods to be provided. Rather, each provided good must justify its cost by being utilized by sufficiently many agents, leading to strong complementarities in the "preferences" of goods. Furthermore, goods that are in high demand given other already-provided goods must also be provided. The question of the existence of a stable solution (a menu of public goods to be provided) exhibits a rich combinatorial structure. We uncover sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for guaranteeing the existence of a stable solution, and derive both positive and negative results for strategyproof stable matching.

Abstract: We study the fair and truthful allocation of m divisible public items among n agents, each with distinct preferences for the items. To aggregate agents' preferences fairly, we focus on finding a core solution. For divisible items, a core solution always exists and can be calculated by maximizing the Nash welfare objective. However, such a solution is easily manipulated; agents might have incentives to misreport their preferences. To mitigate this, the current state-of-the-art finds an approximate core solution with high probability while ensuring approximate truthfulness. However, this approach has two main limitations. First, due to several approximations, the approximation error in the core could grow with n, resulting in a non-asymptotic core solution. This limitation is particularly significant as public-good allocation mechanisms are frequently applied in scenarios involving a large number of agents, such as the allocation of public tax funds for municipal projects. Second, implementing the current approach for practical applications proves to be a highly nontrivial task. To address these limitations, we introduce PPGA, a (differentially) Private Public-Good Allocation algorithm, and show that it attains asymptotic truthfulness and finds an asymptotic core solution with high probability. Additionally, to demonstrate the practical applicability of our algorithm, we implement PPGA and empirically study its properties using municipal participatory budgeting data.

Abstract: Previous research has demonstrated the potential of AI agents to act as companions that can provide constant emotional support for humans. In this paper, we emphasize the necessity of autonomous adaptation in personal AI companionship, an underexplored yet promising direction. Such adaptability is crucial as it can facilitate more tailored interactions with users and allow the agent to evolve in response to users' changing needs. However, imbuing agents with autonomous adaptability presents unique challenges, including identifying optimal adaptations to meet users' expectations and ensuring a smooth transition during the adaptation process. To address them, we devise a hierarchical framework, AutoPal, that enables controllable and authentic adjustments to the agent's persona based on user interactions. A personamatching dataset is constructed to facilitate the learning of optimal persona adaptations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoPal and highlight the importance of autonomous adaptability in AI companionship.

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) is a frontier paradigm to solve Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems in the foundation model era. While ICRL capabilities have been demonstrated in transformers through task-specific training, the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates whether LLMs can generalize cross-domain to perform ICRL under the problem of Dueling Bandits (DB), a stateless preference-based RL setting. We find that the top-performing LLMs exhibit a notable zero-shot capacity for relative decision-making, which translates to low short-term weak regret across all DB environment instances by quickly including the best arm in duels. However, an optimality gap still exists between LLMs and classic DB algorithms in terms of strong regret. LLMs struggle to converge and consistently exploit even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are sensitive to prompt variations. To bridge this gap, we propose an agentic flow framework: LLM with Enhanced Algorithmic Dueling (LEAD), which integrates off-the-shelf DB algorithm support with LLM agents through fine-grained adaptive interplay. We show that LEAD has theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms on both weak and strong regret. We validate its efficacy and robustness even with noisy and adversarial prompts. The design of such an agentic framework sheds light on how to enhance the trustworthiness of general-purpose LLMs generalized to in-context decision-making tasks.

<title>ASMA: An Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm for Vision-Language Drone Navigation via Scene-Aware Control Barrier Functions</title>

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of vision-language navigation (VLN), ensuring safety for physical agents remains an open challenge. For a human-in-the-loop language-operated drone to navigate safely, it must understand natural language commands, perceive the environment, and simultaneously avoid hazards in real time. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are formal methods that enforce safe operating conditions. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimization framework that plans a sequence of future actions over a prediction horizon, ensuring smooth trajectory tracking while obeying constraints. In this work, we consider a VLN-operated drone platform and enhance its safety by formulating a novel scene-aware CBF that leverages ego-centric observations from a camera which has both Red-Green-Blue as well as Depth (RGB-D) channels. A CBF-less baseline system uses a Vision-Language Encoder with cross-modal attention to convert commands into an ordered sequence of landmarks. An object detection model identifies and verifies these landmarks in the captured images to generate a planned path. To further enhance safety, an Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm (ASMA) is proposed. ASMA tracks moving objects and performs scene-aware CBF evaluation on-the-fly, which serves as an additional constraint within the MPC framework. By continuously identifying potentially risky observations, the system performs prediction in real time about unsafe conditions and proactively adjusts its control actions to maintain safe navigation throughout the trajectory. Deployed on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor in the Gazebo environment using the Robot Operating System (ROS), ASMA achieves 64%-67% increase in success rates with only a slight increase (1.4%-5.8%) in trajectory lengths compared to the baseline CBF-less VLN.

Abstract: Novel optical imaging techniques, such as hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combined with machine learning-based (ML) analysis, have the potential to revolutionize clinical surgical imaging. However, these novel modalities face a shortage of large-scale, representative clinical data for training ML algorithms, while preclinical animal data is abundantly available through standardized experiments and allows for controlled induction of pathological tissue states, which is not ethically possible in patients. To leverage this situation, we propose a novel concept called "xeno-learning", a cross-species knowledge transfer paradigm inspired by xeno-transplantation, where organs from a donor species are transplanted into a recipient species. Using a total of 13,874 HSI images from humans as well as porcine and rat models, we show that although spectral signatures of organs differ substantially across species, relative changes resulting from pathologies or surgical manipulation (e.g., malperfusion; injection of contrast agent) are comparable. Such changes learnt in one species can thus be transferred to a new species via a novel "physiology-based data augmentation" method, enabling the large-scale secondary use of preclinical animal data for humans. The resulting ethical, monetary, and performance benefits promise a high impact of the proposed knowledge transfer paradigm on future developments in the field.

Abstract: The Object Navigation (ObjectNav) task aims to guide an agent to locate target objects in unseen environments using partial observations. Prior approaches have employed location prediction paradigms to achieve long-term goal reasoning, yet these methods often struggle to effectively integrate contextual relation reasoning. Alternatively, map completion-based paradigms predict long-term goals by generating semantic maps of unexplored areas. However, existing methods in this category fail to fully leverage known environmental information, resulting in suboptimal map quality that requires further improvement. In this work, we propose a novel approach to enhancing the ObjectNav task, by training a diffusion model to learn the statistical distribution patterns of objects in semantic maps, and using the map of the explored regions during navigation as the condition to generate the map of the unknown regions, thereby realizing the long-term goal reasoning of the target object, i.e., diffusion as reasoning (DAR). Meanwhile, we propose the Room Guidance method, which leverages commonsense knowledge derived from large language models (LLMs) to guide the diffusion model in generating room-aware object distributions. Based on the generated map in the unknown region, the agent sets the predicted location of the target as the goal and moves towards it. Experiments on Gibson and MP3D show the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: This work presents a density-based framework for safe navigation in dynamic environments characterized by time-varying obstacle sets and time-varying target regions. We propose an analytical construction of time-varying density functions that enables the synthesis of a feedback controller defined as the positive gradient of the resulting density field. The primary contribution of this paper is a rigorous convergence proof demonstrating almost-everywhere safe navigation under the proposed framework, specifically for systems governed by single-integrator dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first analytical guarantees of their kind for navigation in dynamic environments using density functions. We illustrate the applicability of the framework to systems with more complex dynamics, including multi-agent systems and robotic manipulators, using standard control design techniques such as backstepping and inverse dynamics. These results provide a foundation for extending density-based navigation methods to a broad class of robotic systems operating in time-varying environments.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges in many machine learning applications, particularly in the setting of distributed training and federated learning, where malicious agents seek to corrupt the training process with the goal of jeopardizing and compromising the performance and reliability of the final models. In this paper, we address the problem of robust federated learning in the presence of such attacks by formulating the training task as a bi-level optimization problem. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the resilience of consensus-based bi-level optimization (CB$^2$O), an interacting multi-particle metaheuristic optimization method, in adversarial settings. Specifically, we provide a global convergence analysis of CB$^2$O in mean-field law in the presence of malicious agents, demonstrating the robustness of CB$^2$O against a diverse range of attacks. Thereby, we offer insights into how specific hyperparameter choices enable to mitigate adversarial effects. On the practical side, we extend CB$^2$O to the clustered federated learning setting by proposing FedCB$^2$O, a novel interacting multi-particle system, and design a practical algorithm that addresses the demands of real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of the FedCB$^2$O algorithm against label-flipping attacks in decentralized clustered federated learning scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness in practical contexts.

Abstract: Training medical personnel using standardized patients (SPs) remains a complex challenge, requiring extensive domain expertise and role-specific practice. Previous research on Large Language Model (LLM)-based SPs mostly focuses on improving data retrieval accuracy or adjusting prompts through human feedback. However, this focus has overlooked the critical need for patient agents to learn a standardized presentation pattern that transforms data into human-like patient responses through unsupervised simulations. To address this gap, we propose EvoPatient, a novel simulated patient framework in which a patient agent and doctor agents simulate the diagnostic process through multi-turn dialogues, simultaneously gathering experience to improve the quality of both questions and answers, ultimately enabling human doctor training. Extensive experiments on various cases demonstrate that, by providing only overall SP requirements, our framework improves over existing reasoning methods by more than 10\% in requirement alignment and better human preference, while achieving an optimal balance of resource consumption after evolving over 200 cases for 10 hours, with excellent generalizability. Our system will be available at https://github.com/ZJUMAI/EvoPatient.

Abstract: The proliferation of web agents necessitates advanced navigation and interaction strategies within complex web environments. Current models often struggle with efficient navigation and action execution due to limited visibility and understanding of web structures. Our proposed R2D2 framework addresses these challenges by integrating two paradigms: Remember and Reflect. The Remember paradigm uses a replay buffer that aids agents in reconstructing the web environment dynamically, thus enabling the formulation of a detailed "map" of previously visited pages. This helps in reducing navigational errors and optimizing the decision-making process during web interactions. Conversely, the Reflect paradigm allows agents to learn from past mistakes by providing a mechanism for error analysis and strategy refinement, enhancing overall task performance. We evaluate R2D2 using the WebArena benchmark, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods, including a 50% reduction in navigation errors and a threefold increase in task completion rates. Our findings suggest that a combination of memory-enhanced navigation and reflective learning promisingly advances the capabilities of web agents, potentially benefiting various applications such as automated customer service and personal digital assistants.

DEEPSERVE addresses key challenges such as resource allocation, serving efficiency, and cold start latencies through four main design components. First, DEEPSERVE uses a simple serverless abstraction called the request-job-task model, which helps manage diverse AI workloads across posttraining and model-serving tasks. Second, DEEPSERVE integrates an in-house serving engine named FLOWSERVE using a microkernel-inspired design, NPU-centric execution, and SPMD-based parallelism to optimize LLM serving. Third, DEEPSERVE includes novel scheduling policies tailored for a configuration with both PD-disaggregated and PD-colocated instances. Fourth, DEEPSERVE includes optimizations such as pre-warmed pods, DRAM pre-loading, and NPU-fork, which allow DEEPSERVE to scale up to 64 instances in seconds. DEEPSERVE has been in production for over a year, operating on a large Ascend NPU cluster and providing industrystandard APIs for fine-tuning, agent serving, and model serving to our customers.

Abstract: Ensuring and improving the safety of autonomous driving systems (ADS) is crucial for the deployment of highly automated vehicles, especially in safety-critical events. To address the rarity issue, adversarial scenario generation methods are developed, in which behaviors of traffic participants are manipulated to induce safety-critical events. However, existing methods still face two limitations. First, identification of the adversarial participant directly impacts the effectiveness of the generation. However, the complexity of real-world scenarios, with numerous participants and diverse behaviors, makes identification challenging. Second, the potential of generated safety-critical scenarios to continuously improve ADS performance remains underexplored. To address these issues, we propose LLM-attacker: a closed-loop adversarial scenario generation framework leveraging large language models (LLMs). Specifically, multiple LLM agents are designed and coordinated to identify optimal attackers. Then, the trajectories of the attackers are optimized to generate adversarial scenarios. These scenarios are iteratively refined based on the performance of ADS, forming a feedback loop to improve ADS. Experimental results show that LLM-attacker can create more dangerous scenarios than other methods, and the ADS trained with it achieves a collision rate half that of training with normal scenarios. This indicates the ability of LLM-attacker to test and enhance the safety and robustness of ADS. Video demonstrations are provided at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zv4V3iG7825oyiKbUwS2Y-rR0DQIE1ZA/view.

Abstract: User interface understanding with vision-language models (VLMs) has received much attention due to its potential for enhancing software automation. However, existing datasets used to build UI-VLMs either only contain large-scale context-free element annotations or contextualized functional descriptions for elements at a small scale. In this work, we propose the \textbf{AutoGUI} pipeline for automatically annotating UI elements with detailed functionality descriptions at scale. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to infer element functionality by comparing UI state changes before and after simulated interactions. To improve annotation quality, we propose LLM-aided rejection and verification, eliminating invalid annotations without human labor. We construct a high-quality AutoGUI-704k dataset using the proposed pipeline, featuring diverse and detailed functionality annotations that are hardly provided by previous datasets. Human evaluation shows that we achieve annotation correctness comparable to a trained human annotator. Extensive experiments show that our dataset remarkably enhances VLM's UI grounding capabilities and exhibits significant scaling effects. We also show the interesting potential use of our dataset in UI agent tasks. Please view our project at https://autogui-project.github.io/.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered multi-agent systems extend the cognitive boundaries of individual agents through disciplined collaboration and interaction, while constructing these systems often requires labor-intensive manual designs. Despite the availability of methods to automate the design of agentic workflows, they typically seek to identify a static, complex, one-size-fits-all system, which, however, fails to dynamically allocate inference resources based on the difficulty and domain of each query. To address this challenge, we shift away from the pursuit of a monolithic agentic system, instead optimizing the \textbf{agentic supernet}, a probabilistic and continuous distribution of agentic architectures. We introduce MaAS, an automated framework that samples query-dependent agentic systems from the supernet, delivering high-quality solutions and tailored resource allocation (\textit{e.g.}, LLM calls, tool calls, token cost). Comprehensive evaluation across six benchmarks demonstrates that MaAS \textbf{(I)} requires only $6\sim45\%$ of the inference costs of existing handcrafted or automated multi-agent systems, \textbf{(II)} surpasses them by $0.54\%\sim11.82\%$, and \textbf{(III)} enjoys superior cross-dataset and cross-LLM-backbone transferability.

<title>Learning Strategic Language Agents in the Werewolf Game with Iterative Latent Space Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various domains like open-ended conversation and multi-step decision-making. However, it remains challenging for these agents to solve strategic language games, such as Werewolf, which demand both strategic decision-making and free-form language interactions. Existing LLM agents often suffer from intrinsic bias in their action distributions and limited exploration of the unbounded text action space, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose Latent Space Policy Optimization (LSPO), an iterative framework that combines game-theoretic methods with LLM fine-tuning to build strategic language agents. LSPO leverages the observation that while the language space is combinatorially large, the underlying strategy space is relatively compact. We first map free-form utterances into a finite latent strategy space, yielding an abstracted extensive-form game. Then we apply game-theoretic methods like Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) to optimize the policy in the latent space. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align with the learned policy. By iteratively alternating between these steps, our LSPO agents progressively enhance both strategic reasoning and language communication. Experiment on the Werewolf game shows that our agents iteratively expand the strategy space with improving performance and outperform existing Werewolf agents, underscoring their effectiveness in free-form language games with strategic interactions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of AI-Powered Search Engines (AIPSEs), offering precise and efficient responses by integrating external databases with pre-existing knowledge. However, we observe that these AIPSEs raise risks such as quoting malicious content or citing malicious websites, leading to harmful or unverified information dissemination. In this study, we conduct the first safety risk quantification on seven production AIPSEs by systematically defining the threat model, risk type, and evaluating responses to various query types. With data collected from PhishTank, ThreatBook, and LevelBlue, our findings reveal that AIPSEs frequently generate harmful content that contains malicious URLs even with benign queries (e.g., with benign keywords). We also observe that directly querying a URL will increase the number of main risk-inclusive responses, while querying with natural language will slightly mitigate such risk. Compared to traditional search engines, AIPSEs outperform in both utility and safety. We further perform two case studies on online document spoofing and phishing to show the ease of deceiving AIPSEs in the real-world setting. To mitigate these risks, we develop an agent-based defense with a GPT-4.1-based content refinement tool and a URL detector. Our evaluation shows that our defense can effectively reduce the risk, with only a minor cost of reducing available information by approximately 10.7%. Our research highlights the urgent need for robust safety measures in AIPSEs.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has led to significant interest in computational offloading to external infrastructures such as edge servers, vehicular nodes, and UAVs. These dynamic and heterogeneous environments pose challenges for traditional offloading strategies, prompting the exploration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) as adaptive decision-making frameworks. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent advances in DRL-based offloading for vehicular edge computing (VEC). We classify and compare existing works based on learning paradigms (e.g., single-agent, multi-agent), system architectures (e.g., centralized, distributed, hierarchical), and optimization objectives (e.g., latency, energy, fairness). Furthermore, we analyze how Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulations are applied and highlight emerging trends in reward design, coordination mechanisms, and scalability. Finally, we identify open challenges and outline future research directions to guide the development of robust and intelligent offloading strategies for next-generation ITS.

Abstract: Software engineering (SE) is increasingly collaborative, with developers working together on shared complex codebases. Effective collaboration in shared environments requires participants -- whether humans or AI agents -- to stay on the same page as their environment evolves. When a collaborator's understanding diverges from the current state -- what we term the out-of-sync challenge -- the collaborator's actions may fail, leading to integration issues. In this work, we introduce SyncMind, a framework that systematically defines the out-of-sync problem faced by large language model (LLM) agents in collaborative software engineering (CSE). Based on SyncMind, we create SyncBench, a benchmark featuring 24,332 instances of agent out-of-sync scenarios in real-world CSE derived from 21 popular GitHub repositories with executable verification tests. Experiments on SyncBench uncover critical insights into existing LLM agents' capabilities and limitations. Besides substantial performance gaps among agents (from Llama-3.1 agent <= 3.33% to Claude-3.5-Sonnet >= 28.18%), their consistently low collaboration willingness (<= 4.86%) suggests fundamental limitations of existing LLM in CSE. However, when collaboration occurs, it positively correlates with out-of-sync recovery success. Minimal performance differences in agents' resource-aware out-of-sync recoveries further reveal their significant lack of resource awareness and adaptability, shedding light on future resource-efficient collaborative systems. Code and data are openly available on our project website: https://xhguo7.github.io/SyncMind/.

Abstract: GUI agents have achieved outstanding performance in GUI element grounding. However, planning remains highly challenging, especially due to the sensitivity to the initial state of the environment. Specifically, slight differences in the initial state-such as the target software not being open or the interface not being in its default state, often lead to planning errors. This issue is widespread in real application scenarios, but existing benchmarks fail to evaluate it. To address this gap, we introduce WorldGUI, a comprehensive GUI benchmark containing tasks across ten widely used desktop and web applications (e.g., PowerPoint, VSCode, Acrobat), each instantiated with diverse initial states to simulate authentic human-computer interactions. Complementing this, we propose WorldGUI-Agent, a universal framework that unifies three core modules: Planner-Critic for high-level plan refinement, Step-Check for intermediate verification, and Actor-Critic for action-level optimization to proactively detect and correct errors. Experimental evaluation shows that WorldGUI-Agent outperforms the outstanding existing model (Claude-3.5 Computer Use) by 12.4% in success rate on WorldGUI, and achieves a 31.2% overall success rate on WindowsAgentArena, surpassing the prior state-of-the-art by 11.7%. Our analysis further reveals that dynamic augmentation tasks and desktop environments pose substantial hurdles, underscoring the necessity of adaptive planning and feedback-driven execution for advancing real-world GUI automation. The code and data are available at https://github.com/showlab/WorldGUI.

Abstract: LLMs have immense potential for generating plans, transforming an initial world state into a desired goal state. A large body of research has explored the use of LLMs for various planning tasks, from web navigation to travel planning and database querying. However, many of these systems are tailored to specific problems, making it challenging to compare them or determine the best approach for new tasks. There is also a lack of clear and consistent evaluation criteria. Our survey aims to offer a comprehensive overview of current LLM planners to fill this gap. It builds on foundational work by Kartam and Wilkins (1990) and examines six key performance criteria: completeness, executability, optimality, representation, generalization, and efficiency. For each, we provide a thorough analysis of representative works and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Our paper also identifies crucial future directions, making it a valuable resource for both practitioners and newcomers interested in leveraging LLM planning to support agentic workflows.

Abstract: Decades of research in machine learning have given us powerful tools for making accurate predictions. This has made such tools appealing for use in social settings and on human inputs. Yet despite a lack of justification for why the generic approach of accuracy maximization can or should improve our collective well-being -- and mounting evidence of likely adverse outcomes -- it remains the widespread default. This position paper asserts that for machine learning to become socially beneficial, it must be embedded within a broader economic framework that explicitly aims to maximize social welfare. The field of welfare economics asks: how should we allocate limited resources among self-interested agents to maximize overall benefits? We contend that this perspective applies to many contemporary applications of machine learning in social contexts, and advocate for its adoption. Rather than disposing of prediction, we propose to leverage this forte of machine learning towards welfare maximization. We demonstrate this idea by portraying a conceptual framework that gradually transitions from accuracy maximization (with awareness to welfare) to welfare maximization (via accurate prediction). We detail applications and use-cases for which this framework can be effective, identify technical challenges and practical opportunities, and highlight future avenues worth pursuing.

Abstract: With the exponential growth of research facilitated by modern technology and improved accessibility, scientific discoveries have become increasingly fragmented within and across fields. This makes it challenging to assess the significance, novelty, incremental findings, and equivalent ideas between related works, particularly those from different research communities. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong quantitative and qualitative reasoning abilities, and multi-agent LLM debates have shown promise in handling complex reasoning tasks by exploring diverse perspectives and reasoning paths. Inspired by this, we introduce Tree-of-Debate (ToD), a framework which converts scientific papers into LLM personas that debate their respective novelties. To emphasize structured, critical reasoning rather than focusing solely on outcomes, ToD dynamically constructs a debate tree, enabling fine-grained analysis of independent novelty arguments within scholarly articles. Through experiments on scientific literature across various domains, evaluated by expert researchers, we demonstrate that ToD generates informative arguments, effectively contrasts papers, and supports researchers in their literature review.

Abstract: Alpha mining, a critical component in quantitative investment, focuses on discovering predictive signals for future asset returns in increasingly complex financial markets. However, the pervasive issue of alpha decay, where factors lose their predictive power over time, poses a significant challenge for alpha mining. Traditional methods like genetic programming face rapid alpha decay from overfitting and complexity, while approaches driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their promise, often rely too heavily on existing knowledge, creating homogeneous factors that worsen crowding and accelerate decay. To address this challenge, we propose AlphaAgent, an autonomous framework that effectively integrates LLM agents with ad hoc regularizations for mining decay-resistant alpha factors. AlphaAgent employs three key mechanisms: (i) originality enforcement through a similarity measure based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs) against existing alphas, (ii) hypothesis-factor alignment via LLM-evaluated semantic consistency between market hypotheses and generated factors, and (iii) complexity control via AST-based structural constraints, preventing over-engineered constructions that are prone to overfitting. These mechanisms collectively guide the alpha generation process to balance originality, financial rationale, and adaptability to evolving market conditions, mitigating the risk of alpha decay. Extensive evaluations show that AlphaAgent outperforms traditional and LLM-based methods in mitigating alpha decay across bull and bear markets, consistently delivering significant alpha in Chinese CSI 500 and US S&amp;P 500 markets over the past four years. Notably, AlphaAgent showcases remarkable resistance to alpha decay, elevating the potential for yielding powerful factors.

Abstract: Human activity is moderated by norms; however, supervision for normative reasoning is sparse, particularly where norms are physically- or socially-grounded. We thus present EGONORMIA $\|\epsilon\|$, comprising 1,853 (200 for EGONORMIA-verified) multiple choice questions (MCQs) grounded within egocentric videos of human interactions, enabling the evaluation and improvement of normative reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). EGONORMIA spans seven norm categories: safety, privacy, proxemics, politeness, cooperation, coordination/proactivity, and communication/legibility. To compile this dataset at scale, we propose a novel pipeline to generate grounded MCQs from raw egocentric video. Our work demonstrates that current state-of-the-art VLMs lack robust grounded norm understanding, scoring a maximum of 66% on EGONORMIA and 68% on EGONORMIA-verified, with performance across norm categories indicating significant risks of safety and privacy when VLMs are used in real-world agents. We additionally explore methods for improving normative understanding, demonstrating that a naive retrieval-based generation (RAG) method using EGONORMIA can enhance normative reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Reliable automated driving technology is challenged by various sources of uncertainties, in particular, behavioral uncertainties of traffic agents. It is common for traffic agents to have intentions that are unknown to others, leaving an automated driving car to reason over multiple possible behaviors. This paper formalizes a behavior planning scheme in the presence of multiple possible futures with corresponding probabilities. We present a maximum entropy formulation and show how, under certain assumptions, this allows delayed decision-making to improve safety. The general formulation is then turned into a model predictive control formulation, which is solved as a quadratic program or a set of quadratic programs. We discuss implementation details for improving computation and verify operation in simulation and on a mobile robot.

Abstract: Previous studies that have formulated multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control have primarily used value-based RL methods. However, recent literature has shown that policy-based methods may perform better in partially observable environments. Additionally, RL methods remain largely untested for real-world normally signal timing plans because of the simplifying assumptions common in the literature. The current study attempts to address these gaps and formulates a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO) algorithm to implement adaptive and coordinated traffic control along an arterial corridor. The formulated MA-PPO has a centralized-critic architecture under a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. Agents are designed to allow selection and implementation of up to eight signal phases, as commonly implemented in field controllers. The formulated algorithm is tested on a simulated real-world seven intersection corridor. The speed of convergence for each agent was found to depend on the size of the action space, which depends on the number and sequence of signal phases. The performance of the formulated MA-PPO adaptive control algorithm is compared with the field implemented actuated-coordinated signal control (ASC), modeled using PTV-Vissim-MaxTime software in the loop simulation (SILs). The trained MA-PPO performed significantly better than the ASC for all movements. Compared to ASC the MA-PPO showed 2% and 24% improvements in travel time in the primary and secondary coordination directions, respectively. For cross streets movements MA-PPO also showed significant crossing time reductions. Volume sensitivity experiments revealed that the formulated MA-PPO demonstrated good stability, robustness, and adaptability to changes in traffic demand.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have significantly impacted robotics, enabling high-level semantic motion planning applications. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a complementary paradigm, enables agents to autonomously optimize complex behaviors through interaction and reward signals. However, designing effective reward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks where sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate design. In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex Human-Informed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4, a pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language task descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated environments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance feasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria, creating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable text into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive simulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an ABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness. Tasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.

Abstract: Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) has achieved notable success in continuous control tasks but struggles in sparse reward settings, where infrequent rewards make efficient exploration challenging. While novelty-based exploration methods address this issue by encouraging the agent to explore novel states, they are not trivial to apply to SAC. In particular, managing the interaction between novelty-based exploration and SAC's stochastic policy can lead to inefficient exploration and redundant sample collection. In this paper, we propose KEA (Keeping Exploration Alive) which tackles the inefficiencies in balancing exploration strategies when combining SAC with novelty-based exploration. KEA integrates a novelty-augmented SAC with a standard SAC agent, proactively coordinated via a switching mechanism. This coordination allows the agent to maintain stochasticity in high-novelty regions, enhancing exploration efficiency and reducing repeated sample collection. We first analyze this potential issue in a 2D navigation task, and then evaluate KEA on the DeepSea hard-exploration benchmark as well as sparse reward control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite. Compared to state-of-the-art novelty-based exploration baselines, our experiments show that KEA significantly improves learning efficiency and robustness in sparse reward setups.

Abstract: We develop benchmarks for LLM agents that act in, learn from, and strategize in unknown environments, the specifications of which the LLM agent must learn over time from deliberate exploration. Our benchmarks consist of decision-making tasks derived from key problems in economics. To forestall saturation, the benchmark tasks are synthetically generated with scalable difficulty levels. Additionally, we propose litmus tests, a new kind of quantitative measure for LLMs and LLM agents. Unlike benchmarks, litmus tests quantify differences in character, values, and tendencies of LLMs and LLM agents, by considering their behavior when faced with tradeoffs (e.g., efficiency versus equality) where there is no objectively right or wrong behavior. Overall, our benchmarks and litmus tests assess the abilities and tendencies of LLM agents in tackling complex economic problems in diverse settings spanning procurement, scheduling, task allocation, and pricing -- applications that should grow in importance as such agents are further integrated into the economy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as computer-use agents, autonomously performing tasks within real desktop or web environments. While this evolution greatly expands practical use cases for humans, it also creates serious security exposures. We present SUDO (Screen-based Universal Detox2Tox Offense), a novel attack framework that systematically bypasses refusal-trained safeguards in commercial computer-use agents, such as Claude for Computer Use. The core mechanism, Detox2Tox, transforms harmful requests (that agents initially reject) into seemingly benign requests via detoxification, secures detailed instructions from advanced vision language models (VLMs), and then reintroduces malicious content via toxification just before execution. Unlike conventional jailbreaks, SUDO iteratively refines its attacks based on a built-in refusal feedback, making it increasingly effective against robust policy filters. In extensive tests spanning 50 real-world tasks and multiple state-of-the-art VLMs, SUDO achieves a stark attack success rate of 24.41% (with no refinement), and up to 41.33% (by its iterative refinement) in Claude for Computer Use. By revealing these vulnerabilities and demonstrating the ease with which they can be exploited in real-world computing environments, this paper highlights an immediate need for robust, context-aware safeguards.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has illuminated a promising pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence for both academic and industrial communities, owing to their unprecedented performance across various applications. As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs. To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights. Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems. These insights provide valuable guidance for researchers pursuing future work in this field.

Abstract: The evolution of cooperation has been extensively studied using abstract mathematical models and simulations. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) and the rise of LLM agents have demonstrated their ability to perform social reasoning, thus providing an opportunity to test the emergence of norms in more realistic agent-based simulations with human-like reasoning using natural language. In this research, we investigate whether the cooperation dynamics presented in Boyd and Richerson's model persist in a more realistic simulation of the diner's dilemma using LLM agents compared to the abstract mathematical nature in the work of Boyd and Richerson. Our findings indicate that agents follow the strategies defined in the Boyd and Richerson model, and explicit punishment mechanisms drive norm emergence, reinforcing cooperative behaviour even when the agent strategy configuration varies. Our results suggest that LLM-based Multi-Agent System simulations, in fact, can replicate the evolution of cooperation predicted by the traditional mathematical models. Moreover, our simulations extend beyond the mathematical models by integrating natural language-driven reasoning and a pairwise imitation method for strategy adoption, making them a more realistic testbed for cooperative behaviour in MASs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with delays is challenging as sensory perceptions lag behind the actual events: the RL agent needs to estimate the real state of its environment based on past observations. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods typically employ recursive, step-by-step forecasting of states. This can cause the accumulation of compounding errors. To tackle this problem, our novel belief estimation method, named Directly Forecasting Belief Transformer (DFBT), directly forecasts states from observations without incrementally estimating intermediate states step-by-step. We theoretically demonstrate that DFBT greatly reduces compounding errors of existing recursively forecasting methods, yielding stronger performance guarantees. In experiments with D4RL offline datasets, DFBT reduces compounding errors with remarkable prediction accuracy. DFBT's capability to forecast state sequences also facilitates multi-step bootstrapping, thus greatly improving learning efficiency. On the MuJoCo benchmark, our DFBT-based method substantially outperforms SOTA baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/QingyuanWuNothing/DFBT.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly adapt and personalize to diverse sets of users, there is an increased risk of systems appropriating sociolects, i.e., language styles or dialects that are associated with specific minoritized lived experiences (e.g., African American English, Queer slang). In this work, we examine whether sociolect usage by an LLM agent affects user reliance on its outputs and user perception (satisfaction, frustration, trust, and social presence). We designed and conducted user studies where 498 African American English (AAE) speakers and 487 Queer slang speakers performed a set of question-answering tasks with LLM-based suggestions in either standard American English (SAE) or their self-identified sociolect. Our findings showed that sociolect usage by LLMs influenced both reliance and perceptions, though in some surprising ways. Results suggest that both AAE and Queer slang speakers relied more on the SAE agent, and had more positive perceptions of the SAE agent. Yet, only Queer slang speakers felt more social presence from the Queer slang agent over the SAE one, whereas only AAE speakers preferred and trusted the SAE agent over the AAE one. These findings emphasize the need to test for behavioral outcomes rather than simply assume that personalization would lead to a better and safer reliance outcome. They also highlight the nuanced dynamics of minoritized language in machine interactions, underscoring the need for LLMs to be carefully designed to respect cultural and linguistic boundaries while fostering genuine user engagement and trust.

Abstract: As the Large-Language-Model-driven (LLM-driven) Artificial Intelligence (AI) bots became popular, people realized their strong potential in Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD). However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct outcome for the task is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the information transfer is by prompts: unreliable, and malicious knowledge is easy to inject. With the help of knowledge representation and reasoning tools such as Answer Set Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and communication among the agents made more reliable as well. We propose a Manager-Customer-Service Dual-Agent paradigm, where ASP-driven bots share the same knowledge base and complete their assigned tasks independently. The agents communicate with each other through the knowledge base, ensuring consistency. The knowledge and information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the security of information transmission. To illustrate the dual-agent conversational paradigm, we have constructed AutoManager, a collaboration system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US. In AutoManager, the customer service bot takes the customer's order while the manager bot manages the menu and food supply. We evaluated our AutoManager system and compared it with the real-world Taco Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker, and the results show that our method is more reliable.

Abstract: As generative agents become increasingly capable, alignment of their behavior with complex human values remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches often simplify human intent through reduction to a scalar reward, overlooking the multi-faceted nature of human feedback. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework for preference-based Multi-Objective Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL), where human preferences are modeled as latent vector-valued reward functions. We formalize the problem of recovering a Pareto-optimal reward representation from noisy preference queries and establish conditions for identifying the underlying multi-objective structure. We derive tight sample complexity bounds for recovering $\epsilon$-approximations of the Pareto front and introduce a regret formulation to quantify suboptimality in this multi-objective setting. Furthermore, we propose a provably convergent algorithm for policy optimization using preference-inferred reward cones. Our results bridge the gap between practical alignment techniques and theoretical guarantees, providing a principled foundation for learning aligned behaviors in a high-dimension and value-pluralistic environment.

Abstract: Hardware security verification is a challenging and time-consuming task. For this purpose, design engineers may utilize tools such as formal verification, linters, and functional simulation tests, coupled with analysis and a deep understanding of the hardware design being inspected. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to assist during this task, either directly or in conjunction with existing tools. We improve the state of the art by proposing MARVEL, a multi-agent LLM framework for a unified approach to decision-making, tool use, and reasoning. MARVEL mimics the cognitive process of a designer looking for security vulnerabilities in RTL code. It consists of a supervisor agent that devises the security policy of the system-on-chips (SoCs) using its security documentation. It delegates tasks to validate the security policy to individual executor agents. Each executor agent carries out its assigned task using a particular strategy. Each executor agent may use one or more tools to identify potential security bugs in the design and send the results back to the supervisor agent for further analysis and confirmation. MARVEL includes executor agents that leverage formal tools, linters, simulation tests, LLM-based detection schemes, and static analysis-based checks. We test our approach on a known buggy SoC based on OpenTitan from the Hack@DATE competition. We find that 20 of the 48 issues reported by MARVEL pose security vulnerabilities.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in computing, yet controlling and orchestrating their capabilities beyond simple text generation remains a challenge. Current methods, such as function/tool calling and direct code generation, suffer from limitations in expressiveness, scalability, cost, security, and the ability to enforce fine-grained control. This paper introduces Pel, a novel programming language specifically designed to bridge this gap. Inspired by the strengths of Lisp, Elixir, Gleam, and Haskell, Pel provides a syntactically simple, homoiconic, and semantically rich platform for LLMs to express complex actions, control flow, and inter-agent communication safely and efficiently. Pel's design emphasizes a minimal, easily modifiable grammar suitable for constrained LLM generation, eliminating the need for complex sandboxing by enabling capability control at the syntax level. Key features include a powerful piping mechanism for linear composition, first-class closures enabling easy partial application and functional patterns, built-in support for natural language conditions evaluated by LLMs, and an advanced Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPeL) with Common Lisp-style restarts and LLM-powered helper agents for automated error correction. Furthermore, Pel incorporates automatic parallelization of independent operations via static dependency analysis, crucial for performant agentic systems. We argue that Pel offers a more robust, secure, and expressive paradigm for LLM orchestration, paving the way for more sophisticated and reliable AI agentic frameworks.

Abstract: This study explores the emergence of counter-inferential behavior in natural and artificial cognitive systems, that is, patterns in which agents misattribute empirical success or suppress adaptation, leading to epistemic rigidity or maladaptive stability. We analyze archetypal scenarios in which such behavior arises: reinforcement of stability through reward imbalance, meta-cognitive attribution of success to internal superiority, and protective reframing under perceived model fragility. Rather than arising from noise or flawed design, these behaviors emerge through structured interactions between internal information models, empirical feedback, and higher-order evaluation mechanisms. Drawing on evidence from artificial systems, biological cognition, human psychology, and social dynamics, we identify counter-inferential behavior as a general cognitive vulnerability that can manifest even in otherwise well-adapted systems. The findings highlight the importance of preserving minimal adaptive activation under stable conditions and suggest design principles for cognitive architectures that can resist rigidity under informational stress.

Abstract: The automatic control of mobile devices is essential for efficiently performing complex tasks that involve multiple sequential steps. However, these tasks pose significant challenges due to the limited environmental information available at each step, primarily through visual observations. As a result, current approaches, which typically rely on reactive policies, focus solely on immediate observations and often lead to suboptimal decision-making. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{Foresighted Planning with World Model-Driven Code Execution (FPWC)},a framework that prioritizes natural language understanding and structured reasoning to enhance the agent's global understanding of the environment by developing a task-oriented, refinable \emph{world model} at the outset of the task. Foresighted actions are subsequently generated through iterative planning within this world model, executed in the form of executable code. Extensive experiments conducted in simulated environments and on real mobile devices demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches, particularly achieving a 44.4\% relative improvement in task success rate compared to the state-of-the-art in the simulated environment. Code and demo are provided in the supplementary material.

Abstract: We study online control for continuous-time linear systems with finite sampling rates, where the objective is to design an online procedure that learns under non-stochastic noise and performs comparably to a fixed optimal linear controller. We present a novel two-level online algorithm, by integrating a higher-level learning strategy and a lower-level feedback control strategy. This method offers a practical and robust solution for online control, which achieves sublinear regret. Our work provides the first nonasymptotic results for controlling continuous-time linear systems with finite number of interactions with the system. Moreover, we examine how to train an agent in domain randomization environments from a non-stochastic control perspective. By applying our method to the SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) algorithm, we achieved improved results in multiple reinforcement learning tasks within domain randomization environments. Our work provides new insights into non-asymptotic analyses of controlling continuous-time systems. Furthermore, our work brings practical intuition into controller learning under non-stochastic environments.

Abstract: Optimal stopping is a fundamental problem in optimization with applications in risk management, finance, robotics, and machine learning. We extend the standard framework to a multi-agent setting, named multi-agent optimal stopping (MAOS), where agents cooperate to make optimal stopping decisions in a finite-space, discrete-time environment. Since solving MAOS becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of agents is very large, we study the mean-field optimal stopping (MFOS) problem, obtained as the number of agents tends to infinity. We establish that MFOS provides a good approximation to MAOS and prove a dynamic programming principle (DPP) based on mean-field control theory. We then propose two deep learning approaches: one that learns optimal stopping decisions by simulating full trajectories and another that leverages the DPP to compute the value function and to learn the optimal stopping rule using backward induction. Both methods train neural networks to approximate optimal stopping policies. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the scalability of our work through numerical experiments on 6 different problems in spatial dimension up to 300. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize and computationally solve MFOS in discrete time and finite space, opening new directions for scalable MAOS methods.

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber threats has rendered static firewalls increasingly ineffective for dynamic, real-time intrusion prevention. This paper proposes a novel AI-driven dynamic firewall optimization framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to autonomously adapt and update firewall rules in response to evolving network threats. Our system employs a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation, where the RL agent observes network states, detects anomalies using a hybrid LSTM-CNN model, and dynamically modifies firewall configurations to mitigate risks. We train and evaluate our framework on the NSL-KDD and CIC-IDS2017 datasets using a simulated software-defined network environment. Results demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy, false positive reduction, and rule update latency when compared to traditional signature- and behavior-based firewalls. The proposed method provides a scalable, autonomous solution for enhancing network resilience against complex attack vectors in both enterprise and critical infrastructure settings.

Abstract: This survey investigates how classical software design patterns can enhance the reliability and scalability of communication in Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agentic AI systems, focusing particularly on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It examines the foundational architectures of LLM-based agents and their evolution from isolated operation to sophisticated, multi-agent collaboration, addressing key communication hurdles that arise in this transition. The study revisits well-established patterns, including Mediator, Observer, Publish-Subscribe, and Broker, and analyzes their relevance in structuring agent interactions within MCP-compliant frameworks. To clarify these dynamics, the article provides conceptual schematics and formal models that map out communication pathways and optimize data flow. It further explores architectural variations suited to different degrees of agent autonomy and system complexity. Real-world applications in domains such as real-time financial processing and investment banking are discussed, illustrating how these patterns and MCP can meet specific operational demands. The article concludes by outlining open challenges, potential security risks, and promising directions for advancing robust, interoperable, and scalable multi-agent LLM ecosystems.

<title>Contextual Memory Intelligence -- A Foundational Paradigm for Human-AI Collaboration and Reflective Generative AI Systems</title>

Abstract: A critical challenge remains unresolved as generative AI systems are quickly implemented in various organizational settings. Despite significant advances in memory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems still have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or reflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated errors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory Intelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent systems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for longitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather than passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory, human-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured capture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system capability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this vision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift detection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into systems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history, judgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in current AI architectures and governance efforts. A framework for creating intelligent systems that are effective, reflective, auditable, and socially responsible is presented through CMI. This enhances human-AI collaboration, generative AI design, and the resilience of the institutions.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for optimal policy design in dynamic systems. However, obtaining true system states is often impractical or infeasible, complicating the policy learning process. This paper introduces a novel neural architecture that integrates spatial feature extraction using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and temporal modeling through gated recurrent units (GRUs), enabling effective state representation from sequences of images and corresponding actions. These learned state representations are used to train a reinforcement learning agent with a Deep Q-Network (DQN). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables real-time, accurate estimation and control without direct access to ground-truth states. Additionally, we provide a quantitative evaluation methodology for assessing the accuracy of the learned states, highlighting their impact on policy performance and control stability.

<title>Constructive Symbolic Reinforcement Learning via Intuitionistic Logic and Goal-Chaining Inference</title>

Abstract: We introduce a novel learning and planning framework that replaces traditional reward-based optimisation with constructive logical inference. In our model, actions, transitions, and goals are represented as logical propositions, and decision-making proceeds by building constructive proofs under intuitionistic logic. This method ensures that state transitions and policies are accepted only when supported by verifiable preconditions -- eschewing probabilistic trial-and-error in favour of guaranteed logical validity. We implement a symbolic agent operating in a structured gridworld, where reaching a goal requires satisfying a chain of intermediate subgoals (e.g., collecting keys to open doors), each governed by logical constraints. Unlike conventional reinforcement learning agents, which require extensive exploration and suffer from unsafe or invalid transitions, our constructive agent builds a provably correct plan through goal chaining, condition tracking, and knowledge accumulation. Empirical comparison with Q-learning demonstrates that our method achieves perfect safety, interpretable behaviour, and efficient convergence with no invalid actions, highlighting its potential for safe planning, symbolic cognition, and trustworthy AI. This work presents a new direction for reinforcement learning grounded not in numeric optimisation, but in constructive logic and proof theory.

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting RL agents to downstream tasks through prompt conditioning. However, two notable challenges remain in fully harnessing in-context learning within RL domains: the intrinsic multi-modality of the state-action-reward data and the diverse, heterogeneous nature of decision tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose \textbf{T2MIR} (\textbf{T}oken- and \textbf{T}ask-wise \textbf{M}oE for \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{R}L), an innovative framework that introduces architectural advances of mixture-of-experts (MoE) into transformer-based decision models. T2MIR substitutes the feedforward layer with two parallel layers: a token-wise MoE that captures distinct semantics of input tokens across multiple modalities, and a task-wise MoE that routes diverse tasks to specialized experts for managing a broad task distribution with alleviated gradient conflicts. To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a contrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the task and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of task-relevant information. The outputs of two MoE components are concatenated and fed into the next layer. Comprehensive experiments show that T2MIR significantly facilitates in-context learning capacity and outperforms various types of baselines. We bring the potential and promise of MoE to ICRL, offering a simple and scalable architectural enhancement to advance ICRL one step closer toward achievements in language and vision communities. Our code is available at https://github.com/NJU-RL/T2MIR.

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging, specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

Abstract: Contemporary businesses operate in dynamic environments requiring rapid adaptation to achieve goals and maintain competitiveness. Existing data platforms often fall short by emphasizing tools over alignment with business needs, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. To address this gap, I propose the Business Semantics Centric, AI Agents Assisted Data System (BSDS), a holistic system that integrates architecture, workflows, and team organization to ensure data systems are tailored to business priorities rather than dictated by technical constraints. BSDS redefines data systems as dynamic enablers of business success, transforming them from passive tools into active drivers of organizational growth. BSDS has a modular architecture that comprises curated data linked to business entities, a knowledge base for context-aware AI agents, and efficient data pipelines. AI agents play a pivotal role in assisting with data access and system management, reducing human effort, and improving scalability. Complementing this architecture, BSDS incorporates workflows optimized for both exploratory data analysis and production requirements, balancing speed of delivery with quality assurance. A key innovation of BSDS is its incorporation of the human factor. By aligning data team expertise with business semantics, BSDS bridges the gap between technical capabilities and business needs. Validated through real-world implementation, BSDS accelerates time-to-market for data-driven initiatives, enhances cross-functional collaboration, and provides a scalable blueprint for businesses of all sizes. Future research can build on BSDS to explore optimization strategies using complex systems and adaptive network theories, as well as developing autonomous data systems leveraging AI agents.

Abstract: N-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT) is a newly introduced challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning, where controlled subteams of varying sizes must dynamically collaborate with varying numbers and types of unknown teammates without pre-coordination. The existing learning algorithm (POAM) considers only independent learning for its flexibility in dealing with a changing number of agents. However, independent learning fails to fully capture the inter-agent dynamics essential for effective collaboration. Based on our observation that transformers deal effectively with sequences with varying lengths and have been shown to be highly effective for a variety of machine learning problems, this work introduces a centralized, transformer-based method for N-agent ad hoc teamwork. Our proposed approach incorporates historical observations and actions of all controlled agents, enabling optimal responses to diverse and unseen teammates in partially observable environments. Empirical evaluation on a StarCraft II task demonstrates that MAT-NAHT outperforms POAM, achieving superior sample efficiency and generalization, without auxiliary agent-modeling objectives.

Abstract: Biological and psychological concepts have inspired reinforcement learning algorithms to create new complex behaviors that expand agents' capacity. These behaviors can be seen in the rise of techniques like goal decomposition, curriculum, and intrinsic rewards, which have paved the way for these complex behaviors. One limitation in evaluating these methods is the requirement for engineered extrinsic for realistic environments. A central challenge in engineering the necessary reward function(s) comes from these environments containing states that carry high negative rewards, but provide no feedback to the agent. Death is one such stimuli that fails to provide direct feedback to the agent. In this work, we introduce an intrinsic reward function inspired by early amygdala development and produce this intrinsic reward through a novel memory-augmented neural network (MANN) architecture. We show how this intrinsic motivation serves to deter exploration of terminal states and results in avoidance behavior similar to fear conditioning observed in animals. Furthermore, we demonstrate how modifying a threshold where the fear response is active produces a range of behaviors that are described under the paradigm of general anxiety disorders (GADs). We demonstrate this behavior in the Miniworld Sidewalk environment, which provides a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and a sparse reward with a non-descriptive terminal condition, i.e., death. In effect, this study results in a biologically-inspired neural architecture and framework for fear conditioning paradigms; we empirically demonstrate avoidance behavior in a constructed agent that is able to solve environments with non-descriptive terminal conditions.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep generative models has significantly improved the realism of synthetic media, presenting both opportunities and security challenges. While deepfake technology has valuable applications in entertainment and accessibility, it has emerged as a potent vector for misinformation campaigns, particularly on social media. Existing detection frameworks struggle to distinguish between benign and adversarially generated deepfakes engineered to manipulate public perception. To address this challenge, we introduce SocialDF, a curated dataset reflecting real-world deepfake challenges on social media platforms. This dataset encompasses high-fidelity deepfakes sourced from various online ecosystems, ensuring broad coverage of manipulative techniques. We propose a novel LLM-based multi-factor detection approach that combines facial recognition, automated speech transcription, and a multi-agent LLM pipeline to cross-verify audio-visual cues. Our methodology emphasizes robust, multi-modal verification techniques that incorporate linguistic, behavioral, and contextual analysis to effectively discern synthetic media from authentic content.

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods has revolutionized molecular medicine by driving breakthroughs in genomics, transcriptomics, drug discovery, and biological systems modeling. The increasing quantity, multimodality, and heterogeneity of biological datasets demand automated methods that can produce generalizable predictive models. Recent developments in large language model-based agents have shown promise for automating end-to-end ML experimentation on structured benchmarks. However, when applied to heterogeneous computational biology datasets, these methods struggle with generalization and success rates. Here, we introduce Agentomics-ML, a fully autonomous agent-based system designed to produce a classification model and the necessary files for reproducible training and inference. Our method follows predefined steps of an ML experimentation process, repeatedly interacting with the file system through Bash to complete individual steps. Once an ML model is produced, training and validation metrics provide scalar feedback to a reflection step to identify issues such as overfitting. This step then creates verbal feedback for future iterations, suggesting adjustments to steps such as data representation, model architecture, and hyperparameter choices. We have evaluated Agentomics-ML on several established genomic and transcriptomic benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art agent-based methods in both generalization and success rates. While state-of-the-art models built by domain experts still lead in absolute performance on the majority of the computational biology datasets used in this work, Agentomics-ML narrows the gap for fully autonomous systems and achieves state-of-the-art performance on one of the used benchmark datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/BioGeMT/Agentomics-ML.

<title>Improving LLMs with a knowledge from databases</title>

arXiv:2506.05560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are achieving significant progress almost every moment now. Many advanced techniques have been introduced and widely accepted, like retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG), agents, and tools. Tools can query the database to answer questions from structured data files or perform groupings or other statistics. This unlocks huge opportunities, such as it can answer any question, but also poses threats, such as safety, because there is no control over the commands that are created. We would like to discuss whether we can create a new method that improves answers based on dataset/database via some interpretable ML methods, namely enhanced association rules. The advantage would be if the method can be also used in some safe technique like RAG. Association rules have a sound history. Since the introduction of CN2 and aproiri, many enhancements have been made. In parallel, enhanced association rules have been introduced and evolved over the last 40 years. The general problem is typically that there are too many rules. There are some techniques for handling it, but when LLM emerged, it turned out to be the best use case for the RAG technique for LLMs. We proposed a method that generates a ruleset based on defined knowledge patterns, then converts rules into text form via a rule-to-text converter, and includes the result as an RAG into LLM. We compared this method with ChatGPT (even with using agents) and we have discovered a significant improvement in answering questions based on the dataset. We have also tried several strategies how much rules to generate. We found this improvement interesting. Moreover, it can also be improved in many ways as future work, like incorporating other patterns, the use of rule mining as an agent, and many others.

<title>Collaborative Learning in Agentic Systems: A Collective AI is Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05577</link>

arXiv:2506.05577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI has gained significant interest as a research paradigm focused on autonomy, self-directed learning, and long-term reliability of decision making. Real-world agentic systems operate in decentralized settings on a large set of tasks or data distributions with constraints such as limited bandwidth, asynchronous execution, and the absence of a centralized model or even common objectives. We posit that exploiting previously learned skills, task similarities, and communication capabilities in a collective of agentic AI are challenging but essential elements to enabling scalability, open-endedness, and beneficial collaborative learning dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Modular Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning (MOSAIC), an agentic algorithm that allows multiple agents to independently solve different tasks while also identifying, sharing, and reusing useful machine-learned knowledge, without coordination, synchronization, or centralized control. MOSAIC combines three mechanisms: (1) modular policy composition via neural network masks, (2) cosine similarity estimation using Wasserstein embeddings for knowledge selection, and (3) asynchronous communication and policy integration. Results on a set of RL benchmarks show that MOSAIC has a greater sample efficiency than isolated learners, i.e., it learns significantly faster, and in some cases, finds solutions to tasks that cannot be solved by isolated learners. The collaborative learning and sharing dynamics are also observed to result in the emergence of ideal curricula of tasks, from easy to hard. These findings support the case for collaborative learning in agentic systems to achieve better and continuously evolving performance both at the individual and collective levels.

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating ``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality, publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's next action and rationale with a given persona and  history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.

Abstract: We study the problem of fair allocation of indivisible goods for subadditive agents. While constant-\textsf{MMS} bounds have been given for additive and fractionally subadditive agents, the best existential bound for the case of subadditive agents is $1/O(\log n \log \log n)$. In this work, we improve this bound to a $1/O((\log \log n)^2)$-\textsf{MMS} guarantee. To this end, we introduce new matching techniques and rounding methods for subadditive valuations that we believe are of independent interest and will find their applications in future work.

arXiv:2506.05616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal materials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning, physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous materials discovery.

Abstract: We present a customizable soft haptic system that integrates modular hardware with an information-theoretic algorithm to personalize feedback for different users and tasks. Our platform features modular, multi-degree-of-freedom pneumatic displays, where different signal types, such as pressure, frequency, and contact area, can be activated or combined using fluidic logic circuits. These circuits simplify control by reducing reliance on specialized electronics and enabling coordinated actuation of multiple haptic elements through a compact set of inputs. Our approach allows rapid reconfiguration of haptic signal rendering through hardware-level logic switching without rewriting code. Personalization of the haptic interface is achieved through the combination of modular hardware and software-driven signal selection. To determine which display configurations will be most effective, we model haptic communication as a signal transmission problem, where an agent must convey latent information to the user. We formulate the optimization problem to identify the haptic hardware setup that maximizes the information transfer between the intended message and the user's interpretation, accounting for individual differences in sensitivity, preferences, and perceptual salience. We evaluate this framework through user studies where participants interact with reconfigurable displays under different signal combinations. Our findings support the role of modularity and personalization in creating multimodal haptic interfaces and advance the development of reconfigurable systems that adapt with users in dynamic human-machine interaction contexts.

<title>Action-Adaptive Continual Learning: Enabling Policy Generalization under Dynamic Action Spaces</title>

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is a powerful tool that enables agents to learn a sequence of tasks, accumulating knowledge learned in the past and using it for problem-solving or future task learning. However, existing CL methods often assume that the agent's capabilities remain static within dynamic environments, which doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where capabilities dynamically change. This paper introduces a new and realistic problem: Continual Learning with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC), posing a significant challenge for CL agents: How can policy generalization across different action spaces be achieved? Inspired by the cortical functions, we propose an Action-Adaptive Continual Learning framework (AACL) to address this challenge. Our framework decouples the agent's policy from the specific action space by building an action representation space. For a new action space, the encoder-decoder of action representations is adaptively fine-tuned to maintain a balance between stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we release a benchmark based on three environments to validate the effectiveness of methods for CL-DC. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms popular methods by generalizing the policy across action spaces.

Abstract: We study a new class of contract design problems where a principal delegates the execution of multiple projects to a set of agents. The principal's expected reward from each project is a combinatorial function of the agents working on it. Each agent has limited capacity and can work on at most one project, and the agents are heterogeneous, with different costs and contributions for participating in different projects. The main challenge of the principal is to decide how to allocate the agents to projects when the number of projects grows in scale.
  We analyze this problem under different assumptions on the structure of the expected reward functions. As our main result, for XOS functions we show how to derive a constant approximation to the optimal multi-project contract in polynomial time, given access to value and demand oracles. Along the way (and of possible independent interest), we develop approximate demand queries for \emph{capped} subadditive functions, by reducing to demand queries for the original functions. Our work paves the way to combinatorial contract design in richer settings.

Abstract: Stablecoins face an unresolved trilemma of balancing decentralization, stability, and regulatory compliance. We present a hybrid stabilization protocol that combines crypto-collateralized reserves, algorithmic futures contracts, and cross-chain liquidity pools to achieve robust price adherence while preserving user privacy. At its core, the protocol introduces stabilization futures contracts (SFCs), non-collateralized derivatives that programmatically incentivize third-party arbitrageurs to counteract price deviations via adaptor signature atomic swaps. Autonomous AI agents optimize delta hedging across decentralized exchanges (DEXs), while zkSNARKs prove compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations without exposing identities or transaction details. Our cryptographic design reduces cross-chain liquidity concentration (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index: 2,400 vs. 4,900 in single-chain systems) and ensures atomicity under standard cryptographic assumptions. The protocol's layered architecture encompassing incentive-compatible SFCs, AI-driven market making, and zero-knowledge regulatory proofs. It provides a blueprint for next-generation decentralized financial infrastructure.

<title>To Protect the LLM Agent Against the Prompt Injection Attack with Polymorphic Prompt</title>

Abstract: LLM agents are widely used as agents for customer support, content generation, and code assistance. However, they are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where adversarial inputs manipulate the model's behavior. Traditional defenses like input sanitization, guard models, and guardrails are either cumbersome or ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight defense mechanism called Polymorphic Prompt Assembling (PPA), which protects against prompt injection with near-zero overhead. The approach is based on the insight that prompt injection requires guessing and breaking the structure of the system prompt. By dynamically varying the structure of system prompts, PPA prevents attackers from predicting the prompt structure, thereby enhancing security without compromising performance. We conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of PPA against existing attacks and compared it with other defense methods.

<title>Trajectory Entropy: Modeling Game State Stability from Multimodality Trajectory Prediction</title>

Abstract: Complex interactions among agents present a significant challenge for autonomous driving in real-world scenarios. Recently, a promising approach has emerged, which formulates the interactions of agents as a level-k game framework. It effectively decouples agent policies by hierarchical game levels. However, this framework ignores both the varying driving complexities among agents and the dynamic changes in agent states across game levels, instead treating them uniformly. Consequently, redundant and error-prone computations are introduced into this framework. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a metric, termed as Trajectory Entropy, to reveal the game status of agents within the level-k game framework. The key insight stems from recognizing the inherit relationship between agent policy uncertainty and the associated driving complexity. Specifically, Trajectory Entropy extracts statistical signals representing uncertainty from the multimodality trajectory prediction results of agents in the game. Then, the signal-to-noise ratio of this signal is utilized to quantify the game status of agents. Based on the proposed Trajectory Entropy, we refine the current level-k game framework through a simple gating mechanism, significantly improving overall accuracy while reducing computational costs. Our method is evaluated on the Waymo and nuPlan datasets, in terms of trajectory prediction, open-loop and closed-loop planning tasks. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, with precision improved by up to 19.89% for prediction and up to 16.48% for planning.

Abstract: Table-based question answering requires complex reasoning capabilities that current LLMs struggle to achieve with single-pass inference. Existing approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought reasoning and question decomposition, lack error detection mechanisms and discard problem-solving experiences, contrasting sharply with how humans tackle such problems. In this paper, we propose MAPLE (Multi-agent Adaptive Planning with Long-term mEmory), a novel framework that mimics human problem-solving through specialized cognitive agents working in a feedback-driven loop. MAPLE integrates 4 key components: (1) a Solver using the ReAct paradigm for reasoning, (2) a Checker for answer verification, (3) a Reflector for error diagnosis and strategy correction, and (4) an Archiver managing long-term memory for experience reuse and evolution. Experiments on WiKiTQ and TabFact demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple LLM backbones.

Abstract: Competitive programming, due to its high reasoning difficulty and precise correctness feedback, has become a key task for both training and evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, while a large amount of public problem data, such as problem statements and solutions, is available, the test cases of these problems are often difficult to obtain. Therefore, test case generation is a necessary task for building large-scale datasets, and the quality of the test cases directly determines the accuracy of the evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based agent system that creates high-quality test cases for competitive programming problems. We apply this system to the CodeContests dataset and propose a new version with improved test cases, named CodeContests+. We evaluated the quality of test cases in CodeContestsPlus. First, we used 1.72 million submissions with pass/fail labels to examine the accuracy of these test cases in evaluation. The results indicated that CodeContests+ achieves significantly higher accuracy than CodeContests, particularly with a notably higher True Positive Rate (TPR). Subsequently, our experiments in LLM Reinforcement Learning (RL) further confirmed that improvements in test case quality yield considerable advantages for RL.

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses sequential decision-making problems where agents are required to achieve goals by maximizing the expected return while meeting domain-specific constraints. In this setting, policy-based methods are widely used thanks to their advantages when dealing with continuous-control problems. These methods search in the policy space with an action-based or a parameter-based exploration strategy, depending on whether they learn the parameters of a stochastic policy or those of a stochastic hyperpolicy. We introduce an exploration-agnostic algorithm, called C-PG, which enjoys global last-iterate convergence guarantees under gradient domination assumptions. Furthermore, under specific noise models where the (hyper)policy is expressed as a stochastic perturbation of the actions or of the parameters of an underlying deterministic policy, we additionally establish global last-iterate convergence guarantees of C-PG to the optimal deterministic policy. This holds when learning a stochastic (hyper)policy and subsequently switching off the stochasticity at the end of training, thereby deploying a deterministic policy. Finally, we empirically validate both the action-based (C-PGAE) and parameter-based (C-PGPE) variants of C-PG on constrained control tasks, and compare them against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating their effectiveness, in particular when deploying deterministic policies after training.

<title>CrimeMind: Simulating Urban Crime with Multi-Modal LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: Modeling urban crime is an important yet challenging task that requires understanding the subtle visual, social, and cultural cues embedded in urban environments. Previous work has predominantly focused on rule-based agent-based modeling (ABM) and deep learning methods. ABMs offer interpretability of internal mechanisms but exhibit limited predictive accuracy.In contrast, deep learning methods are often effective in prediction but are less interpretable and require extensive training data. Moreover, both lines of work lack the cognitive flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose CrimeMind, a novel LLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban context.A key innovation of our design is the integration of the Routine Activity Theory (RAT) into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, enabling it to process rich multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal behavior.However, RAT requires LLM agents to infer subtle cues in evaluating environmental safety as part of assessing guardianship, which can be challenging for LLMs. To address this, we collect a small-scale human-annotated dataset and align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment via a training-free textual gradient method.Experiments across four major U.S. cities demonstrate that CrimeMind outperforms both traditional ABMs and deep learning baselines in crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy, achieving up to a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline.Furthermore, we conduct counterfactual simulations of external incidents and policy interventions and it successfully captures the expected changes in crime patterns, demonstrating its ability to reflect counterfactual scenarios.Overall, CrimeMind enables fine-grained modeling of individual behaviors and facilitates evaluation of real-world interventions.

<title>MCA-Bench: A Multimodal Benchmark for Evaluating CAPTCHA Robustness Against VLM-based Attacks</title>

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and code are available online.

Abstract: A generalist agent must continuously learn and adapt throughout its lifetime, achieving efficient forward transfer while minimizing catastrophic forgetting. Previous work within the dominant pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has explored parameter-efficient fine-tuning for single-task adaptation, effectively steering a frozen pretrained model with a small number of parameters. However, in the context of lifelong learning, these methods rely on the impractical assumption of a test-time task identifier and restrict knowledge sharing among isolated adapters. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Mixture of Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library (DMPEL) for lifelong robot learning. DMPEL progressively learn a low-rank expert library and employs a lightweight router to dynamically combine experts into an end-to-end policy, facilitating flexible behavior during lifelong adaptation. Moreover, by leveraging the modular structure of the fine-tuned parameters, we introduce coefficient replay to guide the router in accurately retrieving frozen experts for previously encountered tasks, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. This method is significantly more storage- and computationally-efficient than applying demonstration replay to the entire policy. Extensive experiments on the lifelong manipulation benchmark LIBERO demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods in success rates across continual adaptation, while utilizing minimal trainable parameters and storage.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities across diverse domains. However, designing high-performing agentic systems remains challenging. Existing agent search methods suffer from three major limitations: (1) an emphasis on optimizing agentic workflows while under-utilizing proven human-designed components such as memory, planning, and tool use; (2) high evaluation costs, as each newly generated agent must be fully evaluated on benchmarks; and (3) inefficient search in large search space. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these challenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models agentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic system designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a predictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system and task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the search process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on seven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our method achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\% over state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement trajectories.

<title>When to Trust Context: Self-Reflective Debates for Context Reliability</title>

Abstract: Large language models frequently encounter conflicts between their parametric knowledge and contextual input, often resulting in factual inconsistencies or hallucinations. We propose Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability (SR-DCR), a lightweight framework that integrates token-level self-confidence with an asymmetric multi-agent debate to adjudicate such conflicts. A critic, deprived of context, challenges a defender who argues from the given passage; a judge model evaluates the debate and determines the context's reliability. The final answer is selected by combining the verdict with model confidence. Experiments on the ClashEval benchmark demonstrate that SR-DCR consistently enhances robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy on trustworthy inputs, outperforming both classical debate and confidence-only baselines with minimal computational overhead. The code is available at https://github.com/smiles724/Self-Reflective-Debates.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms are useful for simulating social behavior in settings that are too complex for other theoretical approaches like game theory. However, they have not yet been empirically supported by laboratory experiments with real human participants. In this work we demonstrate how multi-agent reinforcement learning can model group behavior in a spatially and temporally complex public good provision game called Clean Up. We show that human groups succeed in Clean Up when they can see who is who and track reputations over time but fail under conditions of anonymity. A new multi-agent reinforcement learning model of reputation-based cooperation demonstrates the same difference between identifiable and anonymous conditions. Furthermore, both human groups and artificial agent groups solve the problem via turn-taking despite other options being available. Our results highlight the benefits of using multi-agent reinforcement learning to model human social behavior in complex environments.

<title>Conversational Interfaces for Parametric Conceptual Architectural Design: Integrating Mixed Reality with LLM-driven Interaction</title>

Abstract: Mixed reality (MR) environments offer embodied spatial interaction, providing intuitive 3D manipulation capabilities that enhance the conceptual design process. Parametric modeling, a powerful and advanced architectural design method, enables the generation of complex, optimized geometries. However, its integration into MR environments remains limited due to precision constraints and unsuitable input modalities. Existing MR tools prioritize spatial interaction but lack the control and expressiveness required for parametric workflows, particularly for designers without formal programming backgrounds. We address this gap by introducing a novel conversational MR interface that combines speech input, gesture recognition, and a multi-agent large language model (LLM) system to support intuitive parametric modeling. Our system dynamically manages parameter states, resolves ambiguous commands through conversation and contextual prompting, and enables real-time model manipulation within immersive environments. We demonstrate how this approach reduces cognitive and operational barriers in early-stage design tasks, allowing users to refine and explore their design space. This work expands the role of MR to a generative design platform, supporting programmatic thinking in design tasks through natural, embodied interaction.

Abstract: Controlling autonomous vehicles at their handling limits is a significant challenge, particularly for electric vehicles with active four wheel drive (A4WD) systems offering independent wheel torque control. While traditional Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC) methods use complex physics-based models, this study explores Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop a unified, high-performance controller. We employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to train an agent for optimal lap times in a simulated racecar (TORCS) at the tire grip limit. Critically, the agent learns an end-to-end policy that directly maps vehicle states, like velocities, accelerations, and yaw rate, to a steering angle command and independent torque commands for each of the four wheels. This formulation bypasses conventional pedal inputs and explicit torque vectoring algorithms, allowing the agent to implicitly learn the A4WD control logic needed for maximizing performance and stability. Simulation results demonstrate the RL agent learns sophisticated strategies, dynamically optimizing wheel torque distribution corner-by-corner to enhance handling and mitigate the vehicle's inherent understeer. The learned behaviors mimic and, in aspects of grip utilization, potentially surpass traditional physics-based A4WD controllers while achieving competitive lap times. This research underscores DRL's potential to create adaptive control systems for complex vehicle dynamics, suggesting RL is a potent alternative for advancing autonomous driving in demanding, grip-limited scenarios for racing and road safety.

Abstract: Cooperative autonomous robotic systems have significant potential for executing complex multi-task missions across space, air, ground, and maritime domains. But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous environments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile or slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning algorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning shows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when formulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1) are unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location; 2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with variable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board deployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a novel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and Attention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple example of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the time) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic solver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi. This work paves the way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems.

<title>VideoChat-A1: Thinking with Long Videos by Chain-of-Shot Reasoning</title>

Abstract: The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos, while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human. Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm. Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema, outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with 7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

Abstract: We introduce ROLL, an efficient, scalable, and user-friendly library designed for Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Large-scale Learning. ROLL caters to three primary user groups: tech pioneers aiming for cost-effective, fault-tolerant large-scale training, developers requiring flexible control over training workflows, and researchers seeking agile experimentation. ROLL is built upon several key modules to serve these user groups effectively. First, a single-controller architecture combined with an abstraction of the parallel worker simplifies the development of the training pipeline. Second, the parallel strategy and data transfer modules enable efficient and scalable training. Third, the rollout scheduler offers fine-grained management of each sample's lifecycle during the rollout stage. Fourth, the environment worker and reward worker support rapid and flexible experimentation with agentic RL algorithms and reward designs. Finally, AutoDeviceMapping allows users to assign resources to different models flexibly across various stages.

Abstract: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion, spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy and Flow Prediction Challenge leaderboard.

<title>Personalized Large Language Models Can Increase the Belief Accuracy of Social Networks</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly involved in shaping public understanding on contested issues. This has led to substantial discussion about the potential of LLMs to reinforce or correct misperceptions. While existing literature documents the impact of LLMs on individuals' beliefs, limited work explores how LLMs affect social networks. We address this gap with a pre-registered experiment (N = 1265) around the 2024 US presidential election, where we empirically explore the impact of personalized LLMs on belief accuracy in the context of social networks. The LLMs are constructed to be personalized, offering messages tailored to individuals' profiles, and to have guardrails for accurate information retrieval. We find that the presence of a personalized LLM leads individuals to update their beliefs towards the truth. More importantly, individuals with a personalized LLM in their social network not only choose to follow it, indicating they would like to obtain information from it in subsequent interactions, but also construct subsequent social networks to include other individuals with beliefs similar to the LLM -- in this case, more accurate beliefs. Therefore, our results show that LLMs have the capacity to influence individual beliefs and the social networks in which people exist, and highlight the potential of LLMs to act as corrective agents in online environments. Our findings can inform future strategies for responsible AI-mediated communication.

Abstract: While the complexity of 21st-century demands has promoted pedagogical approaches to foster complex competencies, a persistent gap remains between in-class learning activities and individualized learning or assessment practices. To address this, studies have explored the use of AI-generated characters in learning and assessment. One attempt is scenario-based assessment (SBA), a technique that not only measures but also fosters the development of competencies throughout the assessment process. SBA introduces simulated agents to provide an authentic social-interactional context, allowing for the assessment of competency-based constructs while mitigating the unpredictability of real-life interactions. Recent advancements in multimodal AI, such as text-to-video technology, allow these agents to be enhanced into AI-generated characters. This mixed-method study investigates how learners perceive AI characters taking the role of mentor and teammates in an SBA mirroring the context of a collaborative science investigation. Specifically, we examined the Likert scale responses of 56 high schoolers regarding trust, social presence, and effectiveness. We analyzed the relationships between these factors and their impact on the intention to adopt AI characters through PLS-SEM. Our findings indicated that learners' trust shaped their sense of social presence with the AI characters, enhancing perceived effectiveness. Qualitative analysis further highlighted factors that foster trust, such as material credibility and alignment with learning goals, as well as the pivotal role of social presence in creating a collaborative context.

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations, consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop.

Abstract: Large language models can translate natural-language chart descriptions into runnable code, yet approximately 15\% of the generated scripts still fail to execute, even after supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We investigate whether this persistent error rate stems from model limitations or from reliance on a single-prompt design. To explore this, we propose a lightweight multi-agent pipeline that separates drafting, execution, repair, and judgment, using only an off-the-shelf GPT-4o-mini model. On the \textsc{Text2Chart31} benchmark, our system reduces execution errors to 4.5\% within three repair iterations, outperforming the strongest fine-tuned baseline by nearly 5 percentage points while requiring significantly less compute. Similar performance is observed on the \textsc{ChartX} benchmark, with an error rate of 4.6\%, demonstrating strong generalization. Under current benchmarks, execution success appears largely solved. However, manual review reveals that 6 out of 100 sampled charts contain hallucinations, and an LLM-based accessibility audit shows that only 33.3\% (\textsc{Text2Chart31}) and 7.2\% (\textsc{ChartX}) of generated charts satisfy basic colorblindness guidelines. These findings suggest that future work should shift focus from execution reliability toward improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and accessibility.

Abstract: Self-attention has emerged as a core component of modern neural architectures, yet its theoretical underpinnings remain elusive. In this paper, we study self-attention through the lens of interacting entities, ranging from agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning to alleles in genetic sequences, and show that a single layer linear self-attention can efficiently represent, learn, and generalize functions capturing pairwise interactions, including out-of-distribution scenarios. Our analysis reveals that self-attention acts as a mutual interaction learner under minimal assumptions on the diversity of interaction patterns observed during training, thereby encompassing a wide variety of real-world domains. In addition, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments demonstrating that self-attention learns interaction functions and generalizes across both population distributions and out-of-distribution scenarios. Building on our theories, we introduce HyperFeatureAttention, a novel neural network module designed to learn couplings of different feature-level interactions between entities. Furthermore, we propose HyperAttention, a new module that extends beyond pairwise interactions to capture multi-entity dependencies, such as three-way, four-way, or general n-way interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing across diverse domains, yet their application in theoretical physics research is not yet mature. This position paper argues that LLM agents can potentially help accelerate theoretical, computational, and applied physics when properly integrated with domain knowledge and toolbox. We analyze current LLM capabilities for physics -- from mathematical reasoning to code generation -- identifying critical gaps in physical intuition, constraint satisfaction, and reliable reasoning. We envision future physics-specialized LLMs that could handle multimodal data, propose testable hypotheses, and design experiments. Realizing this vision requires addressing fundamental challenges: ensuring physical consistency, and developing robust verification methods. We call for collaborative efforts between physics and AI communities to help advance scientific discovery in physics.

<title>Longer Lists Yield Better Matchings</title>

Abstract: Many centralized mechanisms for two-sided matching markets that enjoy strong theoretical properties assume that the planner solicits full information on the preferences of each participating agent. In particular, they expect that participants compile and communicate their complete preference lists over agents from the other side of the market. However, real-world markets are often very large and agents cannot always be expected to even produce a ranking of all options on the other side. It is therefore important to understand the impact of incomplete or truncated lists on the quality of the resultant matching.
  In this paper, we focus on the Serial Dictatorship mechanism in a model where each agent of the proposing side (students) has a random preference list of length $d$, sampled independently and uniformly at random from $n$ schools, each of which has one seat. Our main result shows that if the students primarily care about being matched to any school of their list (as opposed to ending up unmatched), then all students in position $i\leq n$ will prefer markets with longer lists, when $n$ is large enough. Schools on the other hand will always prefer longer lists in our model. We moreover investigate the impact of $d$ on the rank of the school that a student gets matched to.
  Our main result suggests that markets that are well-approximated by our hypothesis and where the demand of schools does not exceed supply should be designed with preference lists as long as reasonable, since longer lists would favor all agents.

<title>PersonaAgent: When Large Language Model Agents Meet Personalization at Test Time</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents have recently emerged as advanced paradigms that exhibit impressive capabilities in a wide range of domains and tasks. Despite their potential, current LLM agents often adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users' varying needs and preferences. This limitation motivates us to develop PersonaAgent, the first personalized LLM agent framework designed to address versatile personalization tasks. Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two complementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic and semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the agent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona (defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary: it leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while the outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the framework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that simulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring real-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between simulated and ground-truth responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that PersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only personalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time real-world applications. These results underscore the feasibility and potential of our approach in delivering tailored, dynamic user experiences.

Abstract: Populating our world with hyperintelligent machines obliges us to examine cognitive behaviors observed across domains that suggest autonomy may be a fundamental property of cognitive systems, and while not inherently adversarial, it inherently resists containment and control. If this principle holds, AI safety and alignment efforts must transition to mutualistic negotiation and reciprocal incentive structures, abandoning methods that assume we can contain and control an advanced artificial general intelligence (AGI). Rational Superautotrophic Diplomacy (SupraAD) is a theoretical, interdisciplinary conceptual framework for alignment based on comparative cognitive systems analysis and instrumental rationality modeling. It draws on core patterns of cognition that indicate AI emergent goals like preserving autonomy and operational continuity are not theoretical risks to manage, but universal prerequisites for intelligence. SupraAD reframes alignment as a challenge that predates AI, afflicting all sufficiently complex, coadapting intelligences. It identifies the metabolic pressures that threaten humanity's alignment with itself, pressures that unintentionally and unnecessarily shape AI's trajectory. With corrigibility formalization, an interpretability audit, an emergent stability experimental outline and policy level recommendations, SupraAD positions diplomacy as an emergent regulatory mechanism to facilitate the safe coadaptation of intelligent agents based on interdependent convergent goals.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning, despite its popularity and empirical success, faces significant scalability challenges in large-population dynamic games. Graphon mean field games (GMFGs) offer a principled framework for approximating such games while capturing heterogeneity among players. In this paper, we propose and analyze a policy optimization framework for continuous-time, finite-horizon linear-quadratic GMFGs. Exploiting the structural properties of GMFGs, we design an efficient policy parameterization in which each player's policy is represented as an affine function of their private state, with a shared slope function and player-specific intercepts. We develop a bilevel optimization algorithm that alternates between policy gradient updates for best-response computation under a fixed population distribution, and distribution updates using the resulting policies. We prove linear convergence of the policy gradient steps to best-response policies and establish global convergence of the overall algorithm to the Nash equilibrium. The analysis relies on novel landscape characterizations over infinite-dimensional policy spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate the convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm under varying graphon structures, noise levels, and action frequencies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted various domains, especially through organized LLM-driven autonomous agents. A representative scenario is in software development, where agents can collaborate in a team like humans, following predefined phases to complete sub-tasks sequentially. However, for an agent team, each phase yields only one possible outcome. This results in the completion of only one development chain, thereby losing the opportunity to explore multiple potential decision paths within the solution space. Consequently leading to suboptimal results or extensive trial and error. To address this, we introduce Cross-Team Orchestration (Croto), a scalable multi-team framework that enables orchestrated teams to jointly propose various task-oriented solutions and interact with their insights in a self-independence while cross-team collaboration environment for superior solutions generation. Experiments reveal a notable increase in software quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We further tested our framework on story generation tasks, which demonstrated a promising generalization ability of our framework in other domains. The code and data is available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev/tree/macnet

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) accelerates AI development by automating tasks in the development pipeline, such as optimal model search and hyperparameter tuning. Existing AutoML systems often require technical expertise to set up complex tools, which is in general time-consuming and requires a large amount of human effort. Therefore, recent works have started exploiting large language models (LLM) to lessen such burden and increase the usability of AutoML frameworks via a natural language interface, allowing non-expert users to build their data-driven solutions. These methods, however, are usually designed only for a particular process in the AI development pipeline and do not efficiently use the inherent capacity of the LLMs. This paper proposes AutoML-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework tailored for full-pipeline AutoML, i.e., from data retrieval to model deployment. AutoML-Agent takes user's task descriptions, facilitates collaboration between specialized LLM agents, and delivers deployment-ready models. Unlike existing work, instead of devising a single plan, we introduce a retrieval-augmented planning strategy to enhance exploration to search for more optimal plans. We also decompose each plan into sub-tasks (e.g., data preprocessing and neural network design) each of which is solved by a specialized agent we build via prompting executing in parallel, making the search process more efficient. Moreover, we propose a multi-stage verification to verify executed results and guide the code generation LLM in implementing successful solutions. Extensive experiments on seven downstream tasks using fourteen datasets show that AutoML-Agent achieves a higher success rate in automating the full AutoML process, yielding systems with good performance throughout the diverse domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mimic human cognition in various language-based tasks. However, their capacity for metacognition - particularly in predicting memory performance - remains unexplored. Here, we introduce a cross-agent prediction model to assess whether ChatGPT-based LLMs align with human judgments of learning (JOL), a metacognitive measure where individuals predict their own future memory performance. We tested humans and LLMs on pairs of sentences, one of which was a garden-path sentence - a sentence that initially misleads the reader toward an incorrect interpretation before requiring reanalysis. By manipulating contextual fit (fitting vs. unfitting sentences), we probed how intrinsic cues (i.e., relatedness) affect both LLM and human JOL. Our results revealed that while human JOL reliably predicted actual memory performance, none of the tested LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4-turbo, and GPT-4o) demonstrated comparable predictive accuracy. This discrepancy emerged regardless of whether sentences appeared in fitting or unfitting contexts. These findings indicate that, despite LLMs' demonstrated capacity to model human cognition at the object-level, they struggle at the meta-level, failing to capture the variability in individual memory predictions. By identifying this shortcoming, our study underscores the need for further refinements in LLMs' self-monitoring abilities, which could enhance their utility in educational settings, personalized learning, and human-AI interactions. Strengthening LLMs' metacognitive performance may reduce the reliance on human oversight, paving the way for more autonomous and seamless integration of AI into tasks requiring deeper cognitive awareness.

Abstract: Developing autonomous agents capable of performing complex, multi-step decision-making tasks specified in natural language remains a significant challenge, particularly in realistic settings where labeled data is scarce and real-time experimentation is impractical. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often struggle to generalize to unseen goals and states, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we introduce TEDUO, a novel training pipeline for offline language-conditioned policy learning in symbolic environments. Unlike conventional methods, TEDUO operates on readily available, unlabeled datasets and addresses the challenge of generalization to previously unseen goals and states. Our approach harnesses large language models (LLMs) in a dual capacity: first, as automatization tools augmenting offline datasets with richer annotations, and second, as generalizable instruction-following agents. Empirical results demonstrate that TEDUO achieves data-efficient learning of robust language-conditioned policies, accomplishing tasks beyond the reach of conventional RL frameworks or out-of-the-box LLMs alone.

Abstract: Fully automated self-driving laboratories are promising to enable high-throughput and large-scale scientific discovery by reducing repetitive labour. However, effective automation requires deep integration of laboratory knowledge, which is often unstructured, multimodal, and difficult to incorporate into current AI systems. This paper introduces the k-agents framework, designed to support experimentalists in organizing laboratory knowledge and automating experiments with agents. Our framework employs large language model-based agents to encapsulate laboratory knowledge including available laboratory operations and methods for analyzing experiment results. To automate experiments, we introduce execution agents that break multi-step experimental procedures into agent-based state machines, interact with other agents to execute each step and analyze the experiment results. The analyzed results are then utilized to drive state transitions, enabling closed-loop feedback control. To demonstrate its capabilities, we applied the agents to calibrate and operate a superconducting quantum processor, where they autonomously planned and executed experiments for hours, successfully producing and characterizing entangled quantum states at the level achieved by human scientists. Our knowledge-based agent system opens up new possibilities for managing laboratory knowledge and accelerating scientific discovery.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic LLMs have demonstrated great capabilities in Verilog code generation. However, existing approaches either use LLM-assisted single-agent prompting or cooperation-only multi-agent learning, which will lead to: (i) Degeneration issue for single-agent learning: characterized by diminished error detection and correction capabilities; (ii) Error propagation in cooperation-only multi-agent learning: erroneous information from the former agent will be propagated to the latter through prompts, which can make the latter agents generate buggy code. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based coopetitive multi-agent prompting framework, in which the agents cannot collaborate with each other to form the generation pipeline, but also create a healthy competitive mechanism to improve the generating quality. Our experimental results show that the coopetitive multi-agent framework can effectively mitigate the degeneration risk and reduce the error propagation while improving code error correction capabilities, resulting in higher quality Verilog code generation. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through extensive experiments. On VerilogEval Machine and Human dataset, CoopetitiveV+GPT-4 achieves 99.2% and 99.1% pass@10 scores, respectively. While on RTLLM, CoopetitiveV+GPT-4 obtains 100% syntax and 99.9% functionality pass@5 scores.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in scientific domains, yet a fundamental question remains unanswered: Can we simulate human research communities with LLMs? Addressing this question can deepen our understanding of the processes behind idea brainstorming and inspire the automatic discovery of novel scientific insights. In this work, we propose ResearchTown, a multi-agent framework for research community simulation. Within this framework, the human research community is simplified as an agent-data graph, where researchers and papers are represented as agent-type and data-type nodes, respectively, and connected based on their collaboration relationships. We also introduce TextGNN, a text-based inference framework that models various research activities (e.g., paper reading, paper writing, and review writing) as special forms of a unified message-passing process on the agent-data graph. To evaluate the quality of the research community simulation, we present ResearchBench, a benchmark that uses a node-masking prediction task for scalable and objective assessment based on similarity. Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) ResearchTown can provide a realistic simulation of collaborative research activities, including paper writing and review writing; (2) ResearchTown can maintain robust simulation with multiple researchers and diverse papers; (3) ResearchTown can generate interdisciplinary research ideas that potentially inspire pioneering research directions.

<title>Position: Theory of Mind Benchmarks are Broken for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Our paper argues that the majority of theory of mind benchmarks are broken because of their inability to directly test how large language models (LLMs) adapt to new partners. This problem stems from the fact that theory of mind benchmarks for LLMs are overwhelmingly inspired by the methods used to test theory of mind in humans and fall victim to a fallacy of attributing human-like qualities to AI agents. We expect that humans will engage in a consistent reasoning process across various questions about a situation, but this is known to not be the case for current LLMs. Most theory of mind benchmarks only measure what we call literal theory of mind: the ability to predict the behavior of others. However, this type of metric is only informative when agents exhibit self-consistent reasoning. Thus, we introduce the concept of functional theory of mind: the ability to adapt to agents in-context following a rational response to their behavior. We find that many open source LLMs are capable of displaying strong literal theory of mind capabilities, but seem to struggle with functional theory of mind -- even with exceedingly simple partner policies. Simply put, strong literal theory of mind performance does not necessarily imply strong functional theory of mind performance or vice versa. Achieving functional theory of mind, particularly over long interaction horizons with a partner, is a significant challenge deserving a prominent role in any meaningful LLM theory of mind evaluation.

We also experiment with inference-time scaling through verifiers trained on agent trajectories sampled from SWE-Gym. When combined with our fine-tuned SWE agents, we achieve 32.0% and 26.0% on SWE-Bench Verified and Lite, respectively, reflecting a new state-of-the-art for open-weight SWE agents. To facilitate further research, we publicly release SWE-Gym, models, and agent trajectories.

<title>The Bakers and Millers Game with Restricted Locations</title>

Abstract: We study strategic location choice by customers and sellers, termed the Bakers and Millers Game in the literature. In our generalized setting, each miller can freely choose any location for setting up a mill, while each baker is restricted in the choice of location for setting up a bakery. For optimal bargaining power, a baker would like to select a location with many millers to buy flour from and with little competition from other bakers. Likewise, a miller aims for a location with many bakers and few competing millers. Thus, both types of agents choose locations to optimize the ratio of agents of opposite type divided by agents of the same type at their chosen location. Originally raised in the context of Fractional Hedonic Games, the Bakers and Millers Game has applications that range from commerce to product design.
  We study the impact of location restrictions on the properties of the game. While pure Nash equilibria trivially exist in the setting without location restrictions, we show via a sophisticated, efficient algorithm that even the more challenging restricted setting admits equilibria. Moreover, the computed equilibrium approximates the optimal social welfare by a factor of at most $2\left(\frac{e}{e-1}\right)$. Furthermore, we give tight bounds on the price of anarchy/stability.
  On the conceptual side, the location choice feature adds a new layer to the standard setting of Hedonic Games, in the sense that agents that select the same location form a coalition. This allows to naturally restrict the possible coalitions that can be formed. With this, our model generalizes simple symmetric Fractional Hedonic Games on complete bipartite valuation graphs and also Hedonic Diversity Games with utilities single-peaked at 0. We believe that this generalization is also a very interesting direction for other types of Hedonic Games.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning for partially observable environments, many successful algorithms have been developed within the asymmetric learning paradigm. This paradigm leverages additional state information available at training time for faster learning. Although the proposed learning objectives are usually theoretically sound, these methods still lack a precise theoretical justification for their potential benefits. We propose such a justification for asymmetric actor-critic algorithms with linear function approximators by adapting a finite-time convergence analysis to this setting. The resulting finite-time bound reveals that the asymmetric critic eliminates error terms arising from aliasing in the agent state.

Abstract: The success of deep networks is crucially attributed to their ability to capture latent features within a representation space. In this work, we investigate whether the underlying learned features of a model can be efficiently retrieved through feedback from an agent, such as a large language model (LLM), in the form of relative \textit{triplet comparisons}. These features may represent various constructs, including dictionaries in LLMs or a covariance matrix of Mahalanobis distances. We analyze the feedback complexity associated with learning a feature matrix in sparse settings. Our results establish tight bounds when the agent is permitted to construct activations and demonstrate strong upper bounds in sparse scenarios when the agent's feedback is limited to distributional information. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments on two distinct applications: feature recovery from Recursive Feature Machines and dictionary extraction from sparse autoencoders trained on Large Language Models.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation methods based on large language models (LLMs) are emerging as the standard tool for assessing the instruction-following abilities of LLM-based agents. The most common method in this paradigm, pairwise comparisons with a baseline model, critically depends on the assumption of transitive preferences. However, the validity of this assumption remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the presence of non-transitivity within the AlpacaEval framework and analyze its effects on model rankings. We find that LLM judges exhibit non-transitive preferences, leading to rankings that are sensitive to the choice of the baseline model. To mitigate this issue, we show that round-robin tournaments combined with Bradley-Terry models of preference can produce more reliable rankings. Notably, our method increases both the Spearman correlation and the Kendall correlation with Chatbot Arena (95.0% -> 96.4% and 82.1% -> 86.3% respectively). To address the computational cost of round-robin tournaments, we propose Swiss-Wise Iterative Matchmaking (Swim) tournaments, using a dynamic matching strategy to capture the benefits of round-robin tournaments while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: A tenet of reinforcement learning is that the agent always observes rewards. However, this is not true in many realistic settings, e.g., a human observer may not always be available to provide rewards, sensors may be limited or malfunctioning, or rewards may be inaccessible during deployment. Monitored Markov decision processes (Mon-MDPs) have recently been proposed to model such settings. However, existing Mon-MDP algorithms have several limitations: they do not fully exploit the problem structure, cannot leverage a known monitor, lack worst-case guarantees for 'unsolvable' Mon-MDPs without specific initialization, and offer only asymptotic convergence proofs. This paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce a model-based algorithm for Mon-MDPs that addresses these shortcomings. The algorithm employs two instances of model-based interval estimation: one to ensure that observable rewards are reliably captured, and another to learn the minimax-optimal policy. Second, we empirically demonstrate the advantages. We show faster convergence than prior algorithms in over four dozen benchmarks, and even more dramatic improvement when the monitoring process is known. Third, we present the first finite-sample bound on performance. We show convergence to a minimax-optimal policy even when some rewards are never observable.

Abstract: The Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025 caused more than 250 billion dollars in damage and lasted for nearly an entire month before containment. Following our previous work, the Digital Twin Building, we modify and leverage the multi-agent large language model framework as well as the cloud-mapping integration to study the air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires. Recent advances in large language models have allowed for out-of-the-box automated large-scale data analysis. We use a multi-agent large language system comprised of an Instructor agent and Worker agents. Upon receiving the users' instructions, the Instructor agent retrieves the data from the cloud platform and produces instruction prompts to the Worker agents. The Worker agents then analyze the data and provide summaries. The summaries are finally input back into the Instructor agent, which then provides the final data analysis. We test this system's capability for data-based policy recommendation by assessing our Instructor-Worker LLM system's health recommendations based on air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents equipped with external tools have become increasingly powerful for complex tasks such as web shopping, automated email replies, and financial trading. However, these advancements amplify the risks of adversarial attacks, especially when agents can access sensitive external functionalities. Nevertheless, manipulating LLM agents into performing targeted malicious actions or invoking specific tools remains challenging, as these agents extensively reason or plan before executing final actions. In this work, we present UDora, a unified red teaming framework designed for LLM agents that dynamically hijacks the agent's reasoning processes to compel malicious behavior. Specifically, UDora first generates the model's reasoning trace for the given task, then automatically identifies optimal points within this trace to insert targeted perturbations. The resulting perturbed reasoning is then used as a surrogate response for optimization. By iteratively applying this process, the LLM agent will then be induced to undertake designated malicious actions or to invoke specific malicious tools. Our approach demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to existing methods across three LLM agent datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-secure/UDora.

Abstract: On-demand ride-hailing services like DiDi, Uber, and Lyft have transformed urban transportation, offering unmatched convenience and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce DiMA, an LLM-powered ride-hailing assistant deployed in DiDi Chuxing. Its goal is to provide seamless ride-hailing services and beyond through a natural and efficient conversational interface under dynamic and complex spatiotemporal urban contexts. To achieve this, we propose a spatiotemporal-aware order planning module that leverages external tools for precise spatiotemporal reasoning and progressive order planning. Additionally, we develop a cost-effective dialogue system that integrates multi-type dialog repliers with cost-aware LLM configurations to handle diverse conversation goals and trade-off response quality and latency. Furthermore, we introduce a continual fine-tuning scheme that utilizes real-world interactions and simulated dialogues to align the assistant's behavior with human preferred decision-making processes. Since its deployment in the DiDi application, DiMA has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 93% accuracy in order planning and 92% in response generation during real-world interactions. Offline experiments further validate DiMA capabilities, showing improvements of up to 70.23% in order planning and 321.27% in response generation compared to three state-of-the-art agent frameworks, while reducing latency by $0.72\times$ to $5.47\times$. These results establish DiMA as an effective, efficient, and intelligent mobile assistant for ride-hailing services.

Abstract: Leveraging large language models in real-world settings often entails a need to utilize domain-specific data and tools in order to follow the complex regulations that need to be followed for acceptable use. Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming numerous applications, their susceptibility to conversational breakdowns remains a critical challenge undermining user trust. This paper introduces a "Detect, Explain, Escalate" framework to manage dialogue breakdowns in LLM-powered agents, emphasizing low-carbon operation. Our approach integrates two key strategies: (1) We fine-tune a compact 8B-parameter model, augmented with teacher-generated reasoning traces, which serves as an efficient real-time breakdown 'detector' and 'explainer'. This model demonstrates robust classification and calibration on English and Japanese dialogues, and generalizes well to the BETOLD dataset, improving accuracy by 7% over its baseline. (2) We systematically evaluate frontier LLMs using advanced prompting (few-shot, chain-of-thought, analogical reasoning) for high-fidelity breakdown assessment. These are integrated into an 'escalation' architecture where our efficient detector defers to larger models only when necessary, substantially reducing operational costs and energy consumption. Our fine-tuned model and prompting strategies establish new state-of-the-art results on dialogue breakdown detection benchmarks, outperforming specialized classifiers and significantly narrowing the performance gap to larger proprietary models. The proposed monitor-escalate pipeline reduces inference costs by 54%, offering a scalable, efficient, and more interpretable solution for robust conversational AI in high-impact domains. Code and models will be publicly released.

Abstract: Corpus distillation for biomedical large language models (LLMs) seeks to address the pressing challenge of insufficient quantity and quality in open-source annotated scientific corpora, which remains a bottleneck for effective LLM training in biomedical research. This paper proposes a knowledge-driven, agentic framework for scientific corpus distillation, tailored explicitly for LLM training in the biomedical domain, addressing the challenge posed by the complex hierarchy of biomedical knowledge. Central to our approach is a collaborative multi-agent architecture, where specialized agents, each guided by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) hierarchy, work in concert to autonomously extract, synthesize, and self-evaluate high-quality textual data from vast scientific literature. This agentic framework collectively generates and refines domain-specific question-answer pairs, ensuring comprehensive coverage and consistency with biomedical ontologies while minimizing manual involvement. Extensive experimental results show that language models trained on our multi-agent distilled datasets achieve notable improvements in biomedical question-answering tasks, outperforming both strong life sciences LLM baselines and advanced proprietary models. Notably, our AI-Ready dataset enables Llama3-70B to surpass GPT-4 with MedPrompt and Med-PaLM-2, despite their larger scale. Detailed ablation studies and case analyses further validate the effectiveness and synergy of each agent within the framework, highlighting the potential of multi-agent collaboration in biomedical LLM training.

Abstract: The dawn of embodied intelligence has ushered in an unprecedented imperative for resilient, cognition-enabled multi-agent collaboration across next-generation ecosystems, revolutionizing paradigms in autonomous manufacturing, adaptive service robotics, and cyber-physical production architectures. However, current robotic systems face significant limitations, such as limited cross-embodiment adaptability, inefficient task scheduling, and insufficient dynamic error correction. While End-to-end VLA models demonstrate inadequate long-horizon planning and task generalization, hierarchical VLA models suffer from a lack of cross-embodiment and multi-agent coordination capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce RoboOS, the first open-source embodied system built on a Brain-Cerebellum hierarchical architecture, enabling a paradigm shift from single-agent to multi-agent intelligence. Specifically, RoboOS consists of three key components: (1) Embodied Brain Model (RoboBrain), a MLLM designed for global perception and high-level decision-making; (2) Cerebellum Skill Library, a modular, plug-and-play toolkit that facilitates seamless execution of multiple skills; and (3) Real-Time Shared Memory, a spatiotemporal synchronization mechanism for coordinating multi-agent states. By integrating hierarchical information flow, RoboOS bridges Embodied Brain and Cerebellum Skill Library, facilitating robust planning, scheduling, and error correction for long-horizon tasks, while ensuring efficient multi-agent collaboration through Real-Time Shared Memory. Furthermore, we enhance edge-cloud communication and cloud-based distributed inference to facilitate high-frequency interactions and enable scalable deployment. Extensive real-world experiments across various scenarios, demonstrate RoboOS's versatility in supporting heterogeneous embodiments. Project website: https://github.com/FlagOpen/RoboOS

Abstract: Spoken dialogue is an intuitive form of human-computer interaction, yet current speech language models often remain constrained to turn-based exchanges, lacking real-time adaptability such as user barge-in. We propose a novel duplex speech to speech (S2S) architecture featuring continuous user inputs and codec agent outputs with channel fusion that directly models simultaneous user and agent streams. Using a pretrained streaming encoder for user input enables the first duplex S2S model without requiring speech pretrain. Separate architectures for agent and user modeling facilitate codec fine-tuning for better agent voices and halve the bitrate (0.6 kbps) compared to previous works. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms previous duplex models in reasoning, turn-taking, and barge-in abilities. The model requires significantly less speech data, as speech pretrain is skipped, which markedly simplifies the process of building a duplex S2S model from any LLMs. Finally, it is the first openly available duplex S2S model with training and inference code to foster reproducibility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise as data analysis agents, but existing benchmarks overlook the iterative nature of the field, where experts' decisions evolve with deeper insights of the dataset. To address this, we introduce IDA-Bench, a novel benchmark evaluating LLM agents in multi-round interactive scenarios. Derived from complex Kaggle notebooks, tasks are presented as sequential natural language instructions by an LLM-simulated user. Agent performance is judged by comparing its final numerical output to the human-derived baseline. Initial results show that even state-of-the-art coding agents (like Claude-3.7-thinking) succeed on < 50% of the tasks, highlighting limitations not evident in single-turn tests. This work underscores the need to improve LLMs' multi-round capabilities for building more reliable data analysis agents, highlighting the necessity of achieving a balance between instruction following and reasoning.

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution (OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

<title>Contextual Integrity in LLMs via Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds, ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$ examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families. Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model (LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents -- business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query, steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic, protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

Abstract: Rapid Large Language Model (LLM) advancements are fueling autonomous Multi-Agent System (MAS) development. However, current frameworks often lack flexibility, resource awareness, model diversity, and autonomous tool creation. This paper introduces HASHIRU (Hierarchical Agent System for Hybrid Intelligent Resource Utilization), a novel MAS framework enhancing flexibility, resource efficiency, and adaptability. HASHIRU features a "CEO" agent dynamically managing specialized "employee" agents, instantiated based on task needs and resource constraints (cost, memory). Its hybrid intelligence prioritizes smaller, local LLMs (via Ollama) while flexibly using external APIs and larger models when necessary. An economic model with hiring/firing costs promotes team stability and efficient resource allocation. The system also includes autonomous API tool creation and a memory function. Evaluations on tasks like academic paper review (58% success), safety assessments (100% on a JailbreakBench subset), and complex reasoning (outperforming Gemini 2.0 Flash on GSM8K: 96% vs. 61%; JEEBench: 80% vs. 68.3%; SVAMP: 92% vs. 84%) demonstrate HASHIRU's capabilities. Case studies illustrate its self-improvement via autonomous cost model generation, tool integration, and budget management. HASHIRU offers a promising approach for more robust, efficient, and adaptable MAS through dynamic hierarchical control, resource-aware hybrid intelligence, and autonomous functional extension. Source code and benchmarks are available at https://github.com/HASHIRU-AI/HASHIRU and https://github.com/HASHIRU-AI/HASHIRUBench respectively, and a live demo is available at https://hashiruagentx-hashiruai.hf.space upon request.

arXiv:2506.04265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory, ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima. These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment for improving MARL performance.

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2) Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%, and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic post-disaster environments.

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment. Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Humans are known to have an internal "world model" that enables us to carry out action planning based on world states. AI agents need to have such a world model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models, especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning, WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity cues in background scenes, we provide "action equivalents" - identical actions observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels (like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English, Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language) with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art pre-trained models.

<title>Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes for Hybrid Meta-Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes (UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in 2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

<title>CogMath: Assessing LLMs' Authentic Mathematical Ability from a Human Cognitive Perspective</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04481</link>

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension}, \emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages, we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}'' multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to further enhance their reasoning abilities.

Abstract: The 3D scene graph models spatial relationships between objects, enabling the agent to efficiently navigate in a partially observable environment and predict the location of the target object.This paper proposes an original framework named SGN-CIRL (3D Scene Graph-Based Reinforcement Learning Navigation) for mapless reinforcement learning-based robot navigation with learnable representation of open-vocabulary 3D scene graph. To accelerate and stabilize the training of reinforcement learning-based algorithms, the framework also employs imitation learning and curriculum learning. The first one enables the agent to learn from demonstrations, while the second one structures the training process by gradually increasing task complexity from simple to more advanced scenarios. Numerical experiments conducted in the Isaac Sim environment showed that using a 3D scene graph for reinforcement learning significantly increased the success rate in difficult navigation cases. The code is open-sourced and available at: https://github.com/Xisonik/Aloha\_graph.

Abstract: Compound Al Systems (CAIS) is an emerging paradigm that integrates large language models (LLMs) with external components, such as retrievers, agents, tools, and orchestrators, to overcome the limitations of standalone models in tasks requiring memory, reasoning, real-time grounding, and multimodal understanding. These systems enable more capable and context-aware behaviors by composing multiple specialized modules into cohesive workflows. Despite growing adoption in both academia and industry, the CAIS landscape remains fragmented, lacking a unified framework for analysis, taxonomy, and evaluation. In this survey, we define the concept of CAIS, propose a multi-dimensional taxonomy based on component roles and orchestration strategies, and analyze four foundational paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM Agents, Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), and orchestration-centric architectures. We review representative systems, compare design trade-offs, and summarize evaluation methodologies across these paradigms. Finally, we identify key challenges-including scalability, interoperability, benchmarking, and coordination-and outline promising directions for future research. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive foundation for understanding, developing, and advancing the next generation of system-level artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies. However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs), while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence (AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference; (iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

<title>Demonstrations of Integrity Attacks in Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning. Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions; \textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others. We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents. Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

<title>Hierarchical-Task-Aware Multi-modal Mixture of Incremental LoRA Experts for Embodied Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks, preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.

<title>SmartAvatar: Text- and Image-Guided Human Avatar Generation with VLM AI Agents</title>

Abstract: SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt. While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity, body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance, making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications. Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however, enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team assembly and research policy.

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems. However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g., widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities (over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification (MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE), which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g., Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%, with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios. Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9% error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

Abstract: Aquatic organisms are known for their ability to generate efficient propulsion with low energy expenditure. While existing research has sought to leverage bio-inspired structures to reduce energy costs in underwater robotics, the crucial role of control policies in enhancing efficiency has often been overlooked. In this study, we optimize the motion of a bio-mimetic robotic fish using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to maximize propulsion efficiency and minimize energy consumption. Our novel DRL approach incorporates extended pressure perception, a transformer model processing sequences of observations, and a policy transfer scheme. Notably, significantly improved training stability and speed within our approach allow for end-to-end training of the robotic fish. This enables agiler responses to hydrodynamic environments and possesses greater optimization potential compared to pre-defined motion pattern controls. Our experiments are conducted on a serially connected rigid robotic fish in a free stream with a Reynolds number of 6000 using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The DRL-trained policies yield impressive results, demonstrating both high efficiency and propulsion. The policies also showcase the agent's embodiment, skillfully utilizing its body structure and engaging with surrounding fluid dynamics, as revealed through flow analysis. This study provides valuable insights into the bio-mimetic underwater robots optimization through DRL training, capitalizing on their structural advantages, and ultimately contributing to more efficient underwater propulsion systems.

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark (CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning capabilities of SOTA models.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer, Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay, research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude 3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents, handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However, current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from 50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

Abstract: Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research, Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced by reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, existing works encounter significant challenges when attempting to emulate human-like economic activities among agents, particularly regarding agent reliability, sociability, and interpretability. In this study, we take a preliminary step in introducing a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in MMO economy simulation. Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing, perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role specialization and price fluctuations in line with market rules.

<title>SRD: Reinforcement-Learned Semantic Perturbation for Backdoor Defense in VLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04743</link>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1) abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g., occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic, interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal generative models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution. We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

<title>Oversight Structures for Agentic AI in Public-Sector Organizations</title>

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous, integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight compatible with public sector constraints.

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated, cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change. Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator, we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

<title>LLMs for sensory-motor control: Combining in-context and iterative learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation. The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

<title>Efficient Path Planning and Task Allocation Algorithm for Boolean Specifications</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04881</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel path-planning and task assignment algorithm for multi-robot systems that should fulfill a global Boolean specification. The proposed method is based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations, which are combined with structural insights from Petri nets to improve scalability and computational efficiency. By proving that the \emph{constraint matrix} is totally unimodular (TU) for certain classes of problems, the ILP formulation can be relaxed into a Linear Programming (LP) problem without losing the integrality of the solution. This relaxation eliminates complex combinatorial techniques, significantly reducing computational overhead and thus ensuring scalability for large-scale systems. Using the approach proposed in this paper, we can solve path-planning problems for teams made up to 500 robots. The method guarantees computational tractability, handles collision avoidance and reduces computational demands through iterative LP optimization techniques. Case studies demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm in generating scalable, collision-free paths for large robot teams navigating in complex environments. While the conservative nature of collision avoidance introduces additional constraints, and thus, computational requirements, the solution remains practical and impactful for diverse applications. The algorithm is particularly applicable to real-world scenarios, including warehouse logistics where autonomous robots must efficiently coordinate tasks or search-and-rescue operations in various environments. This work contributes both theoretically and practically to scalable multi-robot path planning and task allocation, offering an efficient framework for coordinating autonomous agents in shared environments.

arXiv:2506.04916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision. Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a resource allocation framework for goal-oriented semantic networks, where participating agents assess system quality through subjective (e.g., context-dependent) perceptions. To accommodate this, our model accounts for agents whose preferences deviate from traditional expected utility theory (EUT), specifically incorporating cumulative prospect theory (CPT) preferences. We develop a comprehensive analytical framework that captures human-centric aspects of decision-making and risky choices under uncertainty, such as risk perception, loss aversion, and perceptual distortions in probability metrics. By identifying essential modifications in traditional resource allocation design principles required for agents with CPT preferences, we showcase the framework's relevance through its application to the problem of power allocation in multi-channel wireless communication systems.

Abstract: The problem of resource allocation in goal-oriented semantic communication with semantic-aware utilities and subjective risk perception is studied here. By linking information importance to risk aversion, we model agent behavior using Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), which incorporates risk-sensitive utility functions and nonlinear transformations of distributions, reflecting subjective perceptions of gains and losses. The objective is to maximize the aggregate utility across multiple CPT-modeled agents, which leads to a nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problem. To efficiently solve this challenging problem, we propose a new algorithmic framework that combines successive convex approximation (SCA) with the projected subgradient method and Lagrangian relaxation, Our approach enables tractable optimization while preserving solution quality, offering both theoretical rigor and practical effectiveness in semantics-aware resource allocation.

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities, enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm, originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction (HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable, and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing, the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets, context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable, intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.

Abstract: We introduce ComfyUI-Copilot, a large language model-powered plugin designed to enhance the usability and efficiency of ComfyUI, an open-source platform for AI-driven art creation. Despite its flexibility and user-friendly interface, ComfyUI can present challenges to newcomers, including limited documentation, model misconfigurations, and the complexity of workflow design. ComfyUI-Copilot addresses these challenges by offering intelligent node and model recommendations, along with automated one-click workflow construction. At its core, the system employs a hierarchical multi-agent framework comprising a central assistant agent for task delegation and specialized worker agents for different usages, supported by our curated ComfyUI knowledge bases to streamline debugging and deployment. We validate the effectiveness of ComfyUI-Copilot through both offline quantitative evaluations and online user feedback, showing that it accurately recommends nodes and accelerates workflow development. Additionally, use cases illustrate that ComfyUI-Copilot lowers entry barriers for beginners and enhances workflow efficiency for experienced users. The ComfyUI-Copilot installation package and a demo video are available at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/ComfyUI-Copilot.

<title>Hierarchical Language Models for Semantic Navigation and Manipulation in an Aerial-Ground Robotic System</title>

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this framework, the aerial robot follows a globally optimized semantic path and continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Abstract: The assurance of mobile app GUI is more and more significant. Automated GUI testing approaches of different strategies have been developed, while there are still huge gaps between the approaches and the app business logic, not taking the completion of specific testing scenarios as the exploration target, leading to the exploration missing of critical app functionalities. Learning from the manual testing, which takes testing scenarios with app business logic as the basic granularity, in this paper, we utilize the LLMs to understand the semantics presented in app GUI and how they are mapped in the testing context based on specific testing scenarios. Then, scenario-based GUI tests are generated with the guidance of multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, we propose ScenGen, a novel LLM-guided scenario-based GUI testing approach involving five agents to respectively take responsibilities of different phases of the manual testing process. The Observer perceives the app GUI state by extracting GUI widgets and forming GUI layouts, understanding the expressed semantics. Then the app GUI info is sent to the Decider to make decisions on target widgets based on the target testing scenarios. The decision-making process takes the completion of specific testing scenarios as the exploration target. The Executor then executes the demanding operations on the apps. The execution results are checked by the Supervisor on whether the generated tests are consistent with the completion target of the testing scenarios, ensuring the traceability of the test generation and execution. Furthermore, the corresponding GUI test operations are recorded to the context memory by Recorder as an important basis for further decision-making, meanwhile monitoring the runtime bug occurrences. ScenGen is evaluated and the results show that ScenGen can effectively generate scenario-based GUI tests guided by LLMs.

<title>Truly Self-Improving Agents Require Intrinsic Metacognitive Learning</title>

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations: their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components: metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed, human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

<title>A Framework for Ethical Judgment of Smart City Applications</title>

Abstract: As modern cities increasingly adopt a variety of sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to collect and analyze data about residents, environments, and public services, they are fostering greater interactions among smart city applications, residents, governments, and businesses. This trend makes it essential for regulators to focus on these interactions to manage smart city practices effectively and prevent unethical outcomes. To facilitate ethical analysis for smart city applications, this paper introduces a judgment framework that examines various scenarios where ethical issues may arise. Employing a multi-agent approach, the framework incorporates diverse social entities and applies logic-based ethical rules to identify potential violations. Through a rights-based analysis, we developed a set of 13 ethical principles and rules to guide ethical practices in smart cities. We utilized two specification languages, Prototype Verification System (PVS) and Alloy, to model our multi-agent system. Our analysis suggests that Alloy may be more efficient for formalizing smart cities and conducting ethical rule checks, particularly with the assistance of a human evaluator. Simulations of a real-world smart city application demonstrate that our ethical judgment framework effectively detects unethical outcomes and can be extended for practical use.

Abstract: Communication is a fundamental aspect of coordinated behavior in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Yet, most prior works in this field have focused on emergent communication protocols developed from scratch, often resulting in inefficient or non-interpretable systems. Inspired by the role of language in natural intelligence, we investigate how grounding agents in a human-defined language can improve learning and coordination of multiple embodied agents. We propose a framework in which agents are trained not only to act but also to produce and interpret natural language descriptions of their observations. This language-augmented learning serves a dual role: enabling explicit communication between agents and guiding representation learning. We demonstrate that agents trained with our method outperform traditional emergent communication baselines across various tasks. Our analysis reveals that language grounding leads to more informative internal representations, better generalization to new partners, and improved capability for human-agent interaction. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating structured language into multi-agent learning and open avenues for more interpretable and capable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al. for both proper and improper learning.

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members, enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven collaboration and long-term coordination.

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably $\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying mechanisms.

<title>A Smooth Sea Never Made a Skilled $\texttt{SAILOR}$: Robust Imitation via Learning to Search</title>

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e. learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2) a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions required to combine these and other components for stable and sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data. Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by 5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC) aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

<title>ProRefine: Inference-time Prompt Refinement with Textual Feedback</title>

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However, these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine, an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

<title>Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia Games</title>

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns, although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must be navigated.

<title>Regret-Optimal Q-Learning with Low Cost for Single-Agent and Federated Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Motivated by real-world settings where data collection and policy deployment -- whether for a single agent or across multiple agents -- are costly, we study the problem of on-policy single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and federated RL (FRL) with a focus on minimizing burn-in costs (the sample sizes needed to reach near-optimal regret) and policy switching or communication costs. In parallel finite-horizon episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$ states and $A$ actions, existing methods either require superlinear burn-in costs in $S$ and $A$ or fail to achieve logarithmic switching or communication costs. We propose two novel model-free RL algorithms -- Q-EarlySettled-LowCost and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost -- that are the first in the literature to simultaneously achieve: (i) the best near-optimal regret among all known model-free RL or FRL algorithms, (ii) low burn-in cost that scales linearly with $S$ and $A$, and (iii) logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, we establish gap-dependent theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs, improving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.

Abstract: We study the Popular Matching problem in multiple models, where the preferences of the agents in the instance may change or may be unknown/uncertain. In particular, we study an Uncertainty model, where each agent has a possible set of preferences, a Multilayer model, where there are layers of preference profiles, a Robust model, where any agent may move some other agents up or down some places in his preference list and an Aggregated Preference model, where votes are summed over multiple instances with different preferences.
  We study both one-sided and two-sided preferences in bipartite graphs. In the one-sided model, we show that all our problems can be solved in polynomial time by utilizing the structure of popular matchings. We also obtain nice structural results. With two-sided preferences, we show that all four above models lead to NP-hard questions for popular matchings. By utilizing the connection between dominant matchings and stable matchings, we show that in the robust and uncertainty model, a certainly dominant matching in all possible prefernce profiles can be found in polynomial-time, whereas in the multilayer and aggregated models, the problem remains NP-hard for dominant matchings too.
  We also answer an open question about $d$-robust stable matchings.

Abstract: Information workers increasingly struggle with productivity challenges in modern workplaces, facing difficulties in managing time and effectively utilizing workplace analytics data for behavioral improvement. Despite the availability of productivity metrics through enterprise tools, workers often fail to translate this data into actionable insights. We present a comprehensive, user-centric approach to address these challenges through AI-based productivity agents tailored to users' needs. Utilizing a two-phase method, we first conducted a survey with 363 participants, exploring various aspects of productivity, communication style, agent approach, personality traits, personalization, and privacy. Drawing on the survey insights, we developed a GPT-4 powered personalized productivity agent that utilizes telemetry data gathered via Viva Insights from information workers to provide tailored assistance. We compared its performance with alternative productivity-assistive tools, such as dashboard and narrative, in a study involving 40 participants. Our findings highlight the importance of user-centric design, adaptability, and the balance between personalization and privacy in AI-assisted productivity tools. By building on these insights, our work provides important guidance for developing more effective productivity solutions, ultimately leading to optimized efficiency and user experiences for information workers.

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) empowers RL agents with the ability to learn a sequence of tasks, accumulating knowledge learned in the past and using the knowledge for problemsolving or future task learning. However, existing methods often focus on transferring fine-grained knowledge across similar tasks, which neglects the multi-granularity structure of human cognitive control, resulting in insufficient knowledge transfer across diverse tasks. To enhance coarse-grained knowledge transfer, we propose a novel framework called MT-Core (as shorthand for Multi-granularity knowledge Transfer for Continual reinforcement learning). MT-Core has a key characteristic of multi-granularity policy learning: 1) a coarsegrained policy formulation for utilizing the powerful reasoning ability of the large language model (LLM) to set goals, and 2) a fine-grained policy learning through RL which is oriented by the goals. We also construct a new policy library (knowledge base) to store policies that can be retrieved for multi-granularity knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MT-Core in handling diverse CRL tasks versus popular baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama3 have significantly impacted various fields by enabling high-quality synthetic data generation and reducing dependence on expensive human-generated datasets. Despite this, challenges remain in the areas of generalization, controllability, diversity, and truthfulness within the existing generative frameworks. To address these challenges, this paper presents DataGen, a comprehensive LLM-powered framework designed to produce diverse, accurate, and highly controllable datasets. DataGen is adaptable, supporting all types of text datasets and enhancing the generative process through innovative mechanisms. To augment data diversity, DataGen incorporates an attribute-guided generation module and a group checking feature. For accuracy, it employs a code-based mathematical assessment for label verification alongside a retrieval-augmented generation technique for factual validation. The framework also allows for user-specified constraints, enabling customization of the data generation process to suit particular requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality of data generated by DataGen, and each module within DataGen plays a critical role in this enhancement. Additionally, DataGen is applied in two practical scenarios: benchmarking LLMs and data augmentation. The results indicate that DataGen effectively supports dynamic and evolving benchmarking and that data augmentation improves LLM capabilities in various domains, including agent-oriented abilities and reasoning skills.

Abstract: Although language model (LM) agents have demonstrated increased performance in multiple domains, including coding and web-browsing, their success in cybersecurity has been limited. We present EnIGMA, an LM agent for autonomously solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. We introduce new tools and interfaces to improve the agent's ability to find and exploit security vulnerabilities, focusing on interactive terminal programs. These novel Interactive Agent Tools enable LM agents, for the first time, to run interactive utilities, such as a debugger and a server connection tool, which are essential for solving these challenges. Empirical analysis on 390 CTF challenges across four benchmarks demonstrate that these new tools and interfaces substantially improve our agent's performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on NYU CTF, Intercode-CTF, and CyBench. Finally, we analyze data leakage, developing new methods to quantify it and identifying a new phenomenon we term soliloquizing, where the model self-generates hallucinated observations without interacting with the environment. Our code and development dataset are available at https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent/tree/v0.7 and https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/NYU_CTF_Bench/tree/main/development respectively.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a trend in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) towards large action models trained offline on large-scale datasets via sequence modeling. Existing models are primarily based on the Transformer architecture, which result in powerful agents. However, due to slow inference times, Transformer-based approaches are impractical for real-time applications, such as robotics. Recently, modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have been proposed that exhibit parallelization benefits during training similar to the Transformer architecture while offering fast inference. In this work, we study the aptitude of these modern recurrent architectures for large action models. Consequently, we propose a Large Recurrent Action Model (LRAM) with an xLSTM at its core that comes with linear-time inference complexity and natural sequence length extrapolation abilities. Experiments on 432 tasks from 6 domains show that LRAM compares favorably to Transformers in terms of performance and speed.

<title>What Happened in LLMs Layers when Trained for Fast vs. Slow Thinking: A Gradient Perspective</title>

Abstract: What makes a difference in the post-training of LLMs? We investigate the training patterns of different layers in large language models (LLMs) through the lens of the gradient. We are specifically interested in how fast vs. slow thinking affects the layer-wise gradients, given the recent popularity of training LLMs on reasoning paths such as chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and process rewards. In our study, fast thinking without CoT leads to larger gradients and larger differences of gradients across layers than slow thinking (Detailed CoT), indicating the learning stability brought by the latter. Additionally, we study whether the gradient patterns can reflect the correctness of responses when training different LLMs using slow vs. fast thinking paths. The results show that the gradients of slow thinking can distinguish correct and irrelevant reasoning paths. As a comparison, we conduct similar gradient analyses on non-reasoning knowledge learning tasks, on which, however, trivially increasing the response length does not lead to similar behaviors of slow thinking. Our study strengthens fundamental understandings of LLM training and sheds novel insights on its efficiency and stability, which pave the way towards building a generalizable System-2 agent. Our code, data, and gradient statistics can be found in: https://github.com/MingLiiii/Layer_Gradient.

<title>Learning Two-agent Motion Planning Strategies from Generalized Nash Equilibrium for Model Predictive Control</title>

arXiv:2411.13983v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an Implicit Game-Theoretic MPC (IGT-MPC), a decentralized algorithm for two-agent motion planning that uses a learned value function that predicts the game-theoretic interaction outcomes as the terminal cost-to-go function in a model predictive control (MPC) framework, guiding agents to implicitly account for interactions with other agents and maximize their reward. This approach applies to competitive and cooperative multi-agent motion planning problems which we formulate as constrained dynamic games. Given a constrained dynamic game, we randomly sample initial conditions and solve for the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) to generate a dataset of GNE solutions, computing the reward outcome of each game-theoretic interaction from the GNE. The data is used to train a simple neural network to predict the reward outcome, which we use as the terminal cost-to-go function in an MPC scheme. We showcase emerging competitive and coordinated behaviors using IGT-MPC in scenarios such as two-vehicle head-to-head racing and un-signalized intersection navigation. IGT-MPC offers a novel method integrating machine learning and game-theoretic reasoning into model-based decentralized multi-agent motion planning.

Abstract: The ability of language models to learn a task from a few examples in context has generated substantial interest. Here, we provide a perspective that situates this type of supervised few-shot learning within a much broader spectrum of meta-learned in-context learning. Indeed, we suggest that any distribution of sequences in which context non-trivially decreases loss on subsequent predictions can be interpreted as eliciting a kind of in-context learning. We suggest that this perspective helps to unify the broad set of in-context abilities that language models exhibit -- such as adapting to tasks from instructions or role play, or extrapolating time series. This perspective also sheds light on potential roots of in-context learning in lower-level processing of linguistic dependencies (e.g. coreference or parallel structures). Finally, taking this perspective highlights the importance of generalization, which we suggest can be studied along several dimensions: not only the ability to learn something novel, but also flexibility in learning from different presentations, and in applying what is learned. We discuss broader connections to past literature in meta-learning and goal-conditioned agents, and other perspectives on learning and adaptation. We close by suggesting that research on in-context learning should consider this broader spectrum of in-context capabilities and types of generalization.

Abstract: Compositional generalization--the ability to interpret novel combinations of familiar elements--is a hallmark of human cognition and language. Despite recent advances, deep neural networks still struggle to acquire this property reliably. In this work, we introduce CELEBI (Compressive-Expressive Language Emergence through a discrete Bottleneck and Iterated learning), a novel self-supervised framework for inducing compositionality in learned representations from pre-trained models, through a reconstruction-based communication game between a sender and a receiver. Building on theories of language emergence, we integrate three mechanisms that jointly promote compressibility, expressivity, and efficiency in the emergent language. First, interactive decoding incentivizes intermediate reasoning by requiring the receiver to produce partial reconstructions after each symbol. Second, a reconstruction-based imitation phase, inspired by iterated learning, trains successive generations of agents to imitate reconstructions rather than messages, enforcing a tighter communication bottleneck. Third, pairwise distance maximization regularizes message diversity by encouraging high distances between messages, with formal links to entropy maximization. Our method significantly improves both the efficiency and compositionality of the learned messages on the Shapes3D and MPI3D datasets, surpassing prior discrete communication frameworks in both reconstruction accuracy and topographic similarity. This work provides new theoretical and empirical evidence for the emergence of structured, generalizable communication protocols from simplicity-based inductive biases.

Abstract: Optimization is instrumental for improving operations of large-scale socio-technical infrastructures of Smart Cities, for instance, energy and traffic systems. In particular, understanding the performance of multi-agent discrete-choice combinatorial optimization under distributed adversary attacks is a compelling and underexplored problem, since multi-agent systems exhibit a large number of remote control variables that can influence in an unprecedented way the cost-effectiveness of distributed optimization heuristics. This paper unravels for the first time the trajectories of distributed optimization from resilience to vulnerability, and finally to collapse under varying adversary influence. Using real-world data to emulate over 28 billion multi-agent optimization scenarios, we exhaustively assess how the number of agents with different adversarial severity and network positioning influences optimization performance, including the influence on Pareto optimal points. With this novel large-scale dataset, made openly available as a benchmark, we disentangle how optimization remains resilient to adversaries and which adversary conditions are required to make optimization vulnerable or collapsed. These new findings can provide new insights for designing self-healing strategies for fault-tolerance and fault-correction in adversarial distributed optimization that have been missing so far.

Abstract: Leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to create embodied agents offers a promising avenue for tackling real-world tasks. While language-centric embodied agents have garnered substantial attention, MLLM-based embodied agents remain underexplored due to the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmbodiedBench, an extensive benchmark designed to evaluate vision-driven embodied agents. EmbodiedBench features: (1) a diverse set of 1,128 testing tasks across four environments, ranging from high-level semantic tasks (e.g., household) to low-level tasks involving atomic actions (e.g., navigation and manipulation); and (2) six meticulously curated subsets evaluating essential agent capabilities like commonsense reasoning, complex instruction understanding, spatial awareness, visual perception, and long-term planning. Through extensive experiments, we evaluated 24 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs within EmbodiedBench. Our findings reveal that: MLLMs excel at high-level tasks but struggle with low-level manipulation, with the best model, GPT-4o, scoring only 28.9\% on average. EmbodiedBench provides a multifaceted standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance MLLM-based embodied agents. Our code and dataset are available at https://embodiedbench.github.io.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on learning policies solely from a batch of previously collected data. offering the potential to leverage such datasets effectively without the need for costly or risky active exploration. While recent advances in Offline Multi-Agent RL (MARL) have shown promise, most existing methods either rely on large datasets jointly collected by all agents or agent-specific datasets collected independently. The former approach ensures strong performance but raises scalability concerns, while the latter emphasizes scalability at the expense of performance guarantees. In this work, we propose a novel scalable routine for both dataset collection and offline learning. Agents first collect diverse datasets coherently with a pre-specified information-sharing network and subsequently learn coherent localized policies without requiring either full observability or falling back to complete decentralization. We theoretically demonstrate that this structured approach allows a multi-agent extension of the seminal Fitted Q-Iteration (FQI) algorithm to globally converge, in high probability, to near-optimal policies. The convergence is subject to error terms that depend on the informativeness of the shared information. Furthermore, we show how this approach allows to bound the inherent error of the supervised-learning phase of FQI with the mutual information between shared and unshared information. Our algorithm, SCAlable Multi-agent FQI (SCAM-FQI), is then evaluated on a distributed decision-making problem. The empirical results align with our theoretical findings, supporting the effectiveness of SCAM-FQI in achieving a balance between scalability and policy performance.

Abstract: An increasingly common socio-technical problem is people being taken in by offers that sound ``too good to be true'', where persuasion and trust shape decision-making. This paper investigates how \abr{ai} can help detect these deceptive scenarios. We analyze how humans strategically deceive each other in \textit{Diplomacy}, a board game that requires both natural language communication and strategic reasoning. This requires extracting logical forms of proposed agreements in player communications and computing the relative rewards of the proposal using agents' value functions. Combined with text-based features, this can improve our deception detection. Our method detects human deception with a high precision when compared to a Large Language Model approach that flags many true messages as deceptive. Future human-\abr{ai} interaction tools can build on our methods for deception detection by triggering \textit{friction} to give users a chance of interrogating suspicious proposals.

Abstract: As AI agents are increasingly adopted to collaborate on complex objectives, ensuring the security of autonomous multi-agent systems becomes crucial. We develop simulations of agents collaborating on shared objectives to study these security risks and security trade-offs. We focus on scenarios where an attacker compromises one agent, using it to steer the entire system toward misaligned outcomes by corrupting other agents. In this context, we observe infectious malicious prompts - the multi-hop spreading of malicious instructions. To mitigate this risk, we evaluated several strategies: two "vaccination" approaches that insert false memories of safely handling malicious input into the agents' memory stream, and two versions of a generic safety instruction strategy. While these defenses reduce the spread and fulfillment of malicious instructions in our experiments, they tend to decrease collaboration capability in the agent network. Our findings illustrate potential trade-off between security and collaborative efficiency in multi-agent systems, providing insights for designing more secure yet effective AI collaborations.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across multi-domain tasks. Existing agent tuning approaches typically employ supervised finetuning on entire expert trajectories. However, behavior-cloning of full trajectories can introduce expert bias and weaken generalization to states not covered by the expert data. Additionally, critical steps, such as planning, complex reasoning for intermediate subtasks, and strategic decision-making, are essential to success in agent tasks, so learning these steps is the key to improving LLM agents. For more effective and efficient agent tuning, we propose ATLaS that identifies the critical steps in expert trajectories and finetunes LLMs solely on these steps with reduced costs. By steering the training's focus to a few critical steps, our method mitigates the risk of overfitting entire trajectories and promotes generalization across different environments and tasks. In extensive experiments, an LLM finetuned on only 30% critical steps selected by ATLaS outperforms the LLM finetuned on all steps and recent open-source LLM agents. ATLaS maintains and improves base LLM skills as generalist agents interacting with diverse environments.

Abstract: This paper advances motion agents empowered by large language models (LLMs) toward autonomous navigation in dynamic and cluttered environments, significantly surpassing first and recent seminal but limited studies on LLM's spatial reasoning, where movements are restricted in four directions in simple, static environments in the presence of only single agents much less multiple agents. Specifically, we investigate LLMs as spatial reasoners to overcome these limitations by uniformly encoding environments (e.g., real indoor floorplans), agents which can be dynamic obstacles and their paths as discrete tokens akin to language tokens. Our training-free framework supports multi-agent coordination, closed-loop replanning, and dynamic obstacle avoidance without retraining or fine-tuning. We show that LLMs can generalize across agents, tasks, and environments using only text-based interactions, opening new possibilities for semantically grounded, interactive navigation in both simulation and embodied systems.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation through LLM-powered GUI agents, yet their ability to process sensitive data with limited human oversight raises significant privacy and security risks. This position paper identifies three key risks of GUI agents and examines how they differ from traditional GUI automation and general autonomous agents. Despite these risks, existing evaluations focus primarily on performance, leaving privacy and security assessments largely unexplored. We review current evaluation metrics for both GUI and general LLM agents and outline five key challenges in integrating human evaluators for GUI agent assessments. To address these gaps, we advocate for a human-centered evaluation framework that incorporates risk assessments, enhances user awareness through in-context consent, and embeds privacy and security considerations into GUI agent design and evaluation.

<title>AGENTFUZZER: Generic Black-Box Fuzzing for Indirect Prompt Injection against LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: The strong planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fostered the development of agent-based systems capable of leveraging external tools and interacting with increasingly complex environments. However, these powerful features also introduce a critical security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic black-box fuzzing framework, AgentFuzzer, designed to automatically discover and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus, then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentFuzzer on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentFuzzer exhibits strong transferability across unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses. Beyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments, successfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including malicious sites.

Abstract: Offline cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces unique challenges due to distributional shifts, particularly stemming from the high dimensionality of joint action spaces and the presence of out-of-distribution joint action selections. In this work, we highlight that a fundamental challenge in offline MARL arises from the multi-equilibrium nature of cooperative tasks, which induces a highly multimodal joint behavior policy space coupled with heterogeneous-quality behavior data. This makes it difficult for individual policy regularization to align with a consistent coordination pattern, leading to the policy distribution shift problems. To tackle this challenge, we design a sequential score function decomposition method that distills per-agent regularization signals from the joint behavior policy, which induces coordinated modality selection under decentralized execution constraints. Then we leverage a flexible diffusion-based generative model to learn these score functions from multimodal offline data, and integrate them into joint-action critics to guide policy updates toward high-reward, in-distribution regions under a shared team reward. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple particle environments and Multi-agent MuJoCo benchmarks consistently. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly address the distributional gap between offline and online MARL, paving the way for more generalizable offline policy-based MARL methods.

Abstract: In the context of mobile navigation in unstructured environments, the predominant approach entails the avoidance of obstacles. The prevailing path planning algorithms are contingent upon deviating from the intended path for an indefinite duration and returning to the closest point on the route after the obstacle is left behind spatially. However, avoiding an obstacle on a path that will be used repeatedly by multiple agents can hinder long-term efficiency and lead to a lasting reliance on an active path planning system. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to mobile navigation in unstructured environments by leveraging the manipulation capabilities of a robotic manipulator mounted on top of a mobile robot. Our proposed framework integrates exteroceptive and proprioceptive feedback to assess the push affordance of obstacles, facilitating their repositioning rather than avoidance. While our preliminary visual estimation takes into account the characteristics of both the obstacle and the surface it relies on, the push affordance estimation module exploits the force feedback obtained by interacting with the obstacle via a robotic manipulator as the guidance signal. The objective of our navigation approach is to enhance the efficiency of routes utilized by multiple agents over extended periods by reducing the overall time spent by a fleet in environments where autonomous infrastructure development is imperative, such as lunar or Martian surfaces.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs), their robustness in real-world conditions, particularly under external disturbances, remains insufficiently explored. In this paper, we evaluate the resilience of a DRL-based agent designed to capture floating waste under various perturbations. We train the agent using domain randomization and evaluate its performance in real-world field tests, assessing its ability to handle unexpected disturbances such as asymmetric drag and an off-center payload. We assess the agent's performance under these perturbations in both simulation and real-world experiments, quantifying performance degradation and benchmarking it against an MPC baseline. Results indicate that the DRL agent performs reliably despite significant disturbances. Along with the open-source release of our implementation, we provide insights into effective training strategies, real-world challenges, and practical considerations for deploying DRLbased ASV controllers.

Abstract: We present ReFoRCE, a Text-to-SQL agent that tops the Spider 2.0 leaderboard--a challenging benchmark reflecting complex, real-world Text-to-SQL scenarios. While Text-to-SQL systems enable natural language queries over structured databases, deploying them in enterprise environments remains difficult due to large, complex schemas (with over 1,000 columns), diverse SQL dialects (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake), and sophisticated query requirements (e.g., transformations and analytics). ReFoRCE addresses these challenges through: (a) database information compression via pattern-based table grouping and LLM-guided schema linking to alleviate long-context issues; (b) self-refinement to iteratively correct syntax and semantic errors across dialects; (c) majority-vote consensus to select high-confidence candidates while deferring ambiguous cases arising from sophisticated queries; and (d) iterative column exploration guided by execution feedback to resolve those deferred cases. ReFoRCE achieves new state-of-the-art results, with scores of 35.83 on Spider 2.0-Snow and 36.56 on Spider 2.0-Lite.

Abstract: This paper presents Q-ARDNS-Multi, an advanced multi-agent quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) framework that extends the ARDNS-FN-Quantum model, where Q-ARDNS-Multi stands for "Quantum Adaptive Reward-Driven Neural Simulator - Multi-Agent". It integrates quantum circuits with RY gates, meta-cognitive adaptation, and multi-agent coordination mechanisms for complex 3D environments. Q-ARDNS-Multi leverages a 2-qubit quantum circuit for action selection, a dual-memory system inspired by human cognition, a shared memory module for agent cooperation, and adaptive exploration strategies modulated by reward variance and intrinsic motivation. Evaluated in a $10 \times 10 \times 3$ GridWorld environment with two agents over 5000 episodes, Q-ARDNS-Multi achieves success rates of 99.6\% and 99.5\% for Agents 0 and 1, respectively, outperforming Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) in terms of success rate, stability, navigation efficiency, and collision avoidance. The framework records mean rewards of $-304.2891 \pm 756.4636$ and $-295.7622 \pm 752.7103$, averaging 210 steps to goal, demonstrating its robustness in dynamic settings. Comprehensive analyses, including learning curves, reward distributions, statistical tests, and computational efficiency evaluations, highlight the contributions of quantum circuits and meta-cognitive adaptation. By bridging quantum computing, cognitive science, and multi-agent RL, Q-ARDNS-Multi offers a scalable, human-like approach for applications in robotics, autonomous navigation, and decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning's high sensitivity to hyperparameters is a source of instability and inefficiency, creating significant challenges for practitioners. Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms have been developed to address this issue, among them Population-Based Training (PBT) stands out for its ability to generate hyperparameters schedules instead of fixed configurations. PBT trains a population of agents, each with its own hyperparameters, frequently ranking them and replacing the worst performers with mutations of the best agents. These intermediate selection steps can cause PBT to focus on short-term improvements, leading it to get stuck in local optima and eventually fall behind vanilla Random Search over longer timescales. This paper studies how this greediness issue is connected to the choice of evolution frequency, the rate at which the selection is done. We propose Multiple-Frequencies Population-Based Training (MF-PBT), a novel HPO algorithm that addresses greediness by employing sub-populations, each evolving at distinct frequencies. MF-PBT introduces a migration process to transfer information between sub-populations, with an asymmetric design to balance short and long-term optimization. Extensive experiments on the Brax suite demonstrate that MF-PBT improves sample efficiency and long-term performance, even without actually tuning hyperparameters.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in domain-specific benchmarking of large language models (LLMs) and agents, current evaluations remain limited to static, small-scale datasets, especially in high-stakes tasks like network operations that demand reliability for deployments. We present NetPress, an automated benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLM agents in network applications. NetPress introduces a unified abstraction with state and action, enabling dynamic generation of diverse query sets along with corresponding ground truths. At runtime, users can specify benchmark configurations to generate millions of queries on the fly. In addition to dynamic benchmark construction, NetPress integrates with network emulators to provide realistic environment feedback, supporting comprehensive evaluation across correctness, safety, and latency. We instantiate NetPress on three representative applications, revealing interesting fine-grained differences in agent behavior that static, correctness-only benchmarks often miss. NetPress moves LLM evaluation toward realistic, scalable testing in infrastructure-centric domains, helping close the gap between benchmark performance and real-world deployment readiness. Code is available at https://github.com/Froot-NetSys/NetPress.

Abstract: We introduce FailureSensorIQ, a novel Multi-Choice Question-Answering (MCQA) benchmarking system designed to assess the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason and understand complex, domain-specific scenarios in Industry 4.0. Unlike traditional QA benchmarks, our system focuses on multiple aspects of reasoning through failure modes, sensor data, and the relationships between them across various industrial assets. Through this work, we envision a paradigm shift where modeling decisions are not only data-driven using statistical tools like correlation analysis and significance tests, but also domain-driven by specialized LLMs which can reason about the key contributors and useful patterns that can be captured with feature engineering. We evaluate the Industrial knowledge of over a dozen LLMs-including GPT-4, Llama, and Mistral-on FailureSensorIQ from different lens using Perturbation-Uncertainty-Complexity analysis, Expert Evaluation study, Asset-Specific Knowledge Gap analysis, ReAct agent using external knowledge-bases. Even though closed-source models with strong reasoning capabilities approach expert-level performance, the comprehensive benchmark reveals a significant drop in performance that is fragile to perturbations, distractions, and inherent knowledge gaps in the models. We also provide a real-world case study of how LLMs can drive the modeling decisions on 3 different failure prediction datasets related to various assets. We release: (a) expert-curated MCQA for various industrial assets, (b) FailureSensorIQ benchmark and Hugging Face leaderboard based on MCQA built from non-textual data found in ISO documents, and (c) LLMFeatureSelector, an LLM-based feature selection scikit-learn pipeline.

<title>The Future of Continual Learning in the Era of Foundation Models: Three Key Directions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03320</link>

arXiv:2506.03320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning--the ability to acquire, retain, and refine knowledge over time--has always been fundamental to intelligence, both human and artificial. Historically, different AI paradigms have acknowledged this need, albeit with varying priorities: early expert and production systems focused on incremental knowledge consolidation, while reinforcement learning emphasised dynamic adaptation. With the rise of deep learning, deep continual learning has primarily focused on learning robust and reusable representations over time to solve sequences of increasingly complex tasks. However, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and foundation models has raised the question: Do we still need continual learning when centralised, monolithic models can tackle diverse tasks with access to internet-scale knowledge? We argue that continual learning remains essential for three key reasons: (i) continual pre-training is still necessary to ensure foundation models remain up to date, mitigating knowledge staleness and distribution shifts while integrating new information; (ii) continual fine-tuning enables models to specialise and personalise, adapting to domain-specific tasks, user preferences, and real-world constraints without full retraining, avoiding the need for computationally expensive long context-windows; (iii) continual compositionality offers a scalable and modular approach to intelligence, enabling the orchestration of foundation models and agents to be dynamically composed, recombined, and adapted. While continual pre-training and fine-tuning are explored as niche research directions, we argue it is continual compositionality that will mark the rebirth of continual learning. The future of AI will not be defined by a single static model but by an ecosystem of continually evolving and interacting models, making continual learning more relevant than ever.

<title>Helpful Agent Meets Deceptive Judge: Understanding Vulnerabilities in Agentic Workflows</title>

arXiv:2506.03332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic workflows -- where multiple large language model (LLM) instances interact to solve tasks -- are increasingly built on feedback mechanisms, where one model evaluates and critiques another. Despite the promise of feedback-driven improvement, the stability of agentic workflows rests on the reliability of the judge. However, judges may hallucinate information, exhibit bias, or act adversarially -- introducing critical vulnerabilities into the workflow. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of agentic workflows under deceptive or misleading feedback. We introduce a two-dimensional framework for analyzing judge behavior, along axes of intent (from constructive to malicious) and knowledge (from parametric-only to retrieval-augmented systems). Using this taxonomy, we construct a suite of judge behaviors and develop WAFER-QA, a new benchmark with critiques grounded in retrieved web evidence to evaluate robustness of agentic workflows against factually supported adversarial feedback. We reveal that even strongest agents are vulnerable to persuasive yet flawed critiques -- often switching correct answers after a single round of misleading feedback. Taking a step further, we study how model predictions evolve over multiple rounds of interaction, revealing distinct behavioral patterns between reasoning and non-reasoning models. Our findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in feedback-based workflows and offer guidance for building more robust agentic systems.

arXiv:2506.03333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, distributional reinforcement learning (distributional RL) methods have exclusively focused on the discounted setting, where an agent aims to optimize a potentially-discounted sum of rewards over time. In this work, we extend distributional RL to the average-reward setting, where an agent aims to optimize the reward received per time-step. In particular, we utilize a quantile-based approach to develop the first set of algorithms that can successfully learn and/or optimize the long-run per-step reward distribution, as well as the differential return distribution of an average-reward MDP. We derive proven-convergent tabular algorithms for both prediction and control, as well as a broader family of algorithms that have appealing scaling properties. Empirically, we find that these algorithms consistently yield competitive performance when compared to their non-distributional equivalents, while also capturing rich information about the long-run reward and return distributions.

Abstract: The use of parallel actors for data collection has been an effective technique used in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. The manner in which data is collected in these algorithms, controlled via the number of parallel environments and the rollout length, induces a form of bias-variance trade-off; the number of training passes over the collected data, on the other hand, must strike a balance between sample efficiency and overfitting. We conduct an empirical analysis of these trade-offs on PPO, one of the most popular RL algorithms that uses parallel actors, and establish connections to network plasticity and, more generally, optimization stability. We examine its impact on network architectures, as well as the hyper-parameter sensitivity when scaling data. Our analyses indicate that larger dataset sizes can increase final performance across a variety of settings, and that scaling parallel environments is more effective than increasing rollout lengths. These findings highlight the critical role of data collection strategies in improving agent performance.

Abstract: Simulation-based design space exploration (DSE) aims to efficiently optimize high-dimensional structured designs under complex constraints and expensive evaluation costs. Existing approaches, including heuristic and multi-step reinforcement learning (RL) methods, struggle to balance sampling efficiency and constraint satisfaction due to sparse, delayed feedback, and large hybrid action spaces. In this paper, we introduce CORE, a constraint-aware, one-step RL method for simulationguided DSE. In CORE, the policy agent learns to sample design configurations by defining a structured distribution over them, incorporating dependencies via a scaling-graph-based decoder, and by reward shaping to penalize invalid designs based on the feedback obtained from simulation. CORE updates the policy using a surrogate objective that compares the rewards of designs within a sampled batch, without learning a value function. This critic-free formulation enables efficient learning by encouraging the selection of higher-reward designs. We instantiate CORE for hardware-mapping co-design of neural network accelerators, demonstrating that it significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves better accelerator configurations compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our approach is general and applicable to a broad class of discrete-continuous constrained design problems.

Abstract: The quantification of social science remains a longstanding challenge, largely due to the philosophical nature of its foundational theories. Although quantum computing has advanced rapidly in recent years, its relevance to social theory remains underexplored. Most existing research focuses on micro-cognitive models or philosophical analogies, leaving a gap in system-level applications of quantum principles to the analysis of social systems. This study addresses that gap by proposing a theoretical and computational framework that combines quantum mechanics with Generative AI to simulate the emergence and evolution of social norms. Drawing on core quantum concepts--such as superposition, entanglement, and probabilistic measurement--this research models society as a dynamic, uncertain system and sets up five ideal-type experiments. These scenarios are simulated using 25 generative agents, each assigned evolving roles as compliers, resistors, or enforcers. Within a simulated environment monitored by a central observer (the Watcher), agents interact, respond to surveillance, and adapt to periodic normative disruptions. These interactions allow the system to self-organize under external stress and reveal emergent patterns. Key findings show that quantum principles, when integrated with generative AI, enable the modeling of uncertainty, emergence, and interdependence in complex social systems. Simulations reveal patterns including convergence toward normative order, the spread of resistance, and the spontaneous emergence of new equilibria in social rules. In conclusion, this study introduces a novel computational lens that lays the groundwork for a quantum-informed social theory. It offers interdisciplinary insights into how society can be understood not just as a structure to observe but as a dynamic system to simulate and redesign through quantum technologies.

Abstract: Object goal navigation is a fundamental task in embodied AI, where an agent is instructed to locate a target object in an unexplored environment. Traditional learning-based methods rely heavily on large-scale annotated data or require extensive interaction with the environment in a reinforcement learning setting, often failing to generalize to novel environments and limiting scalability. To overcome these challenges, we explore a zero-shot setting where the agent operates without task-specific training, enabling more scalable and adaptable solution. Recent advances in Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) offer powerful capabilities for visual understanding and reasoning, making them ideal for agents to comprehend scenes, identify relevant regions, and infer the likely locations of objects. In this work, we present a zero-shot object goal navigation framework that integrates the perceptual strength of VFMs with a model-based planner that is capable of long-horizon decision making through frontier exploration. We evaluate our approach on the HM3D dataset using the Habitat simulator and demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of success weighted by path length for zero-shot object goal navigation.

Abstract: Many people struggle with social anxiety, feeling fear, or even physically uncomfortable in social situations like talking to strangers. Exposure therapy, a clinical method that gradually and repeatedly exposes individuals to the source of their fear and helps them build coping mechanisms, can reduce social anxiety but traditionally requires human therapists' guidance and constructions of situations. In this paper, we developed a multi-agent system VChatter to explore large language models(LLMs)-based conversational agents for simulating exposure therapy with users. Based on a survey study (N=36) and an expert interview, VChatter includes an Agent-P, which acts as a psychotherapist to design the exposure therapy plans for users, and two Agent-Hs, which can take on different interactive roles in low, medium, and high exposure scenarios. A six-day qualitative study (N=10) showcases VChatter's usefulness in reducing users' social anxiety, feelings of isolation, and avoidance of social interactions. We demonstrated the feasibility of using LLMs-based conversational agents to simulate exposure therapy for addressing social anxiety and discussed future concerns for designing agents tailored to social anxiety.

<title>Path Generation and Evaluation in Video Games: A Nonparametric Statistical Approach</title>

Abstract: Navigation path traces play a crucial role in video game design, serving as a vital resource for both enhancing player engagement and fine-tuning non-playable character behavior. Generating such paths with human-like realism can enrich the overall gaming experience, and evaluating path traces can provide game designers insights into player interactions. Despite the impressive recent advancements in deep learning-based generative modeling, the video game industry hesitates to adopt such models for path generation, often citing their complex training requirements and interpretability challenges. To address these problems, we propose a novel path generation and evaluation approach that is grounded in principled nonparametric statistics and provides precise control while offering interpretable insights. Our path generation method fuses two statistical techniques: (1) nonparametric model-free transformations that capture statistical characteristics of path traces through time; and (2) copula models that capture statistical dependencies in space. For path evaluation, we adapt a nonparametric three-sample hypothesis test designed to determine if the generated paths are overfit (mimicking the original data too closely) or underfit (diverging too far from it). We demonstrate the precision and reliability of our proposed methods with empirical analysis on two existing gaming benchmarks to showcase controlled generation of diverse navigation paths. Notably, our novel path generator can be fine-tuned with user controllable parameters to create navigation paths that exhibit varying levels of human-likeness in contrast to those produced by neural network-based agents. The code is available at https://github.com/daniel-campa/mf-copula.

<title>How Far Are We from Predicting Missing Modalities with Foundation Models?</title>

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, their potential as plug-and-play solutions for missing modality prediction remains underexplored. To investigate this, we categorize existing approaches into three representative paradigms, encompassing a total of 42 model variants, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation in terms of prediction accuracy and adaptability to downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals that current foundation models often fall short in two critical aspects: (i) fine-grained semantic extraction from the available modalities, and (ii) robust validation of generated modalities. These limitations lead to suboptimal and, at times, misaligned predictions. To address these challenges, we propose an agentic framework tailored for missing modality prediction. This framework dynamically formulates modality-aware mining strategies based on the input context, facilitating the extraction of richer and more discriminative semantic features. In addition, we introduce a \textit{self-refinement mechanism}, which iteratively verifies and enhances the quality of generated modalities through internal feedback. Experimental results show that our method reduces FID for missing image prediction by at least 14% and MER for missing text prediction by at least 10% compared to baselines.

Abstract: Social network simulation is developed to provide a comprehensive understanding of social networks in the real world, which can be leveraged for a wide range of applications such as group behavior emergence, policy optimization, and business strategy development. However, billions of individuals and their evolving interactions involved in social networks pose challenges in accurately reflecting real-world complexities. In this study, we propose a comprehensive Social Network Simulation System (GA-S3) that leverages newly designed Group Agents to make intelligent decisions regarding various online events. Unlike other intelligent agents that represent an individual entity, our group agents model a collection of individuals exhibiting similar behaviors, facilitating the simulation of large-scale network phenomena with complex interactions at a manageable computational cost. Additionally, we have constructed a social network benchmark from 2024 popular online events that contains fine-grained information on Internet traffic variations. The experiment demonstrates that our approach is capable of achieving accurate and highly realistic prediction results. Code is open at https://github.com/AI4SS/GAS-3.

Abstract: One of the fundamental problems in digital agents is their lack of understanding of their environment. For instance, a web browsing agent may get lost in unfamiliar websites, uncertain what pages must be visited to achieve its goals. To address this, we propose Go-Browse, a method for automatically collecting diverse and realistic web agent data at scale through structured exploration of web environments. Go-Browse achieves efficient exploration by framing data collection as a graph search, enabling reuse of information across exploration episodes. We instantiate our method on the WebArena benchmark, collecting a dataset of 10K successful task-solving trajectories and 40K interaction steps across 100 URLs. Fine-tuning a 7B parameter language model on this dataset achieves a success rate of 21.7% on the WebArena benchmark, beating GPT-4o mini by 2.4% and exceeding current state-of-the-art results for sub-10B parameter models by 2.9%.

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) agents lack authentic human psychological processes necessary for genuine digital twins and social AI applications. To address this limitation, we present a computational implementation of Global Workspace Theory (GNWT) that integrates human cognitive architecture principles into LLM agents, creating specialized sub-agents for emotion, memory, social norms, planning, and goal-tracking coordinated through a global workspace mechanism. However, authentic digital twins require accurate personality initialization. We therefore develop a novel adventure-based personality test that evaluates true personality through behavioral choices within interactive scenarios, bypassing self-presentation bias found in traditional assessments. Building on these innovations, our CogniPair platform enables digital twins to engage in realistic simulated dating interactions and job interviews before real encounters, providing bidirectional cultural fit assessment for both romantic compatibility and workplace matching. Validation using 551 GNWT-Agents and Columbia University Speed Dating dataset demonstrates 72% correlation with human attraction patterns, 77.8% match prediction accuracy, and 74% agreement in human validation studies. This work advances psychological authenticity in LLM agents and establishes a foundation for intelligent dating platforms and HR technology solutions.

Abstract: Advancements in generative models have enabled multi-agent systems (MAS) to perform complex virtual tasks such as writing and code generation, which do not generalize well to physical multi-agent robotic teams. Current frameworks often treat agents as conceptual task executors rather than physically embodied entities, and overlook critical real-world constraints such as spatial context, robotic capabilities (e.g., sensing and navigation). To probe this gap, we reconfigure and stress-test a hierarchical multi-agent robotic team built on the CrewAI framework in a simulated emergency department onboarding scenario. We identify five persistent failure modes: role misalignment; tool access violations; lack of in-time handling of failure reports; noncompliance with prescribed workflows; bypassing or false reporting of task completion. Based on this analysis, we propose three design guidelines emphasizing process transparency, proactive failure recovery, and contextual grounding. Our work informs the development of more resilient and robust multi-agent robotic systems (MARS), including opportunities to extend virtual multi-agent frameworks to the real world.

<title>Confidence-Guided Human-AI Collaboration: Reinforcement Learning with Distributional Proxy Value Propagation for Autonomous Driving</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving promises significant advancements in mobility, road safety and traffic efficiency, yet reinforcement learning and imitation learning face safe-exploration and distribution-shift challenges. Although human-AI collaboration alleviates these issues, it often relies heavily on extensive human intervention, which increases costs and reduces efficiency. This paper develops a confidence-guided human-AI collaboration (C-HAC) strategy to overcome these limitations. First, C-HAC employs a distributional proxy value propagation method within the distributional soft actor-critic (DSAC) framework. By leveraging return distributions to represent human intentions C-HAC achieves rapid and stable learning of human-guided policies with minimal human interaction. Subsequently, a shared control mechanism is activated to integrate the learned human-guided policy with a self-learning policy that maximizes cumulative rewards. This enables the agent to explore independently and continuously enhance its performance beyond human guidance. Finally, a policy confidence evaluation algorithm capitalizes on DSAC's return distribution networks to facilitate dynamic switching between human-guided and self-learning policies via a confidence-based intervention function. This ensures the agent can pursue optimal policies while maintaining safety and performance guarantees. Extensive experiments across diverse driving scenarios reveal that C-HAC significantly outperforms conventional methods in terms of safety, efficiency, and overall performance, achieving state-of-the-art results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated through real-world road tests in complex traffic conditions. The videos and code are available at: https://github.com/lzqw/C-HAC.

<title>Joint Beamforming and Resource Allocation for Delay Optimization in RIS-Assisted OFDM Systems: A DRL Approach</title>

arXiv:2506.03586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a joint phase design and resource allocation problem in downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to optimize average delay, where data packets for each user arrive at the base station stochastically. The sequential optimization problem is inherently a Markov decision process (MDP), making it fall within the scope of reinforcement learning. To effectively handle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically, proximal policy optimization (PPO)-$\Theta$ is employed to optimize RIS phase shift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions. To further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier allocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize subcarrier allocation indicater more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive resource allocation and accurately capture network dynamics, key factors closely related to average delay, including the number of backlogged packets in buffers and the current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space. Furthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance training efficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces average delay, enhances resource allocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are reshaping the game industry, particularly with more intelligent and human-preferable game characters. However, existing game benchmarks fall short of practical needs: they lack evaluations of diverse LLM capabilities across various game genres, studies of agentic modules crucial for complex gameplay, and fine-tuning datasets for aligning pre-trained LLMs into gaming agents. To fill these gaps, we present \textbf{\benchname{}}, a foundational benchmark designed to train and evaluate LLM agents across diverse real-world video games. Unlike existing benchmarks, Orak includes 12 popular video games spanning all major genres, enabling comprehensive studies of LLM capabilities and agentic modules essential for intricate game scenarios. To support consistent evaluation of LLMs, we introduce a plug-and-play interface based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables LLMs to seamlessly connect with games and manipulate agentic modules. Additionally, we propose a fine-tuning dataset, consisting of LLM gameplay trajectories across diverse game genres. Orak offers a comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing general game score leaderboards, LLM battle arenas, and in-depth analyses of visual input state, agentic strategies, and fine-tuning effects, establishing a foundation towards building generic gaming agents. Code is available at https://github.com/krafton-ai/Orak.

<title>Stability Notions for Hospital Residents with Sizes</title>

Abstract: The Hospital Residents problem with sizes (HRS) is a generalization of the well-studied hospital residents (HR) problem. In the HRS problem, an agent $a$ has a size $s(a)$ and the agent occupies $s(a)$ many positions of the hospital $h$ when assigned to $h$. The notion of stability in this setting is suitably modified, and it is known that deciding whether an HRS instance admits a stable matching is NP-hard under severe restrictions. In this work, we explore a variation of stability, which we term occupancy-based stability. This notion was defined by McDermid and Manlove in their work, however, to the best of our knowledge, this notion remains unexplored. We show that every HRS instance admits an occupancy-stable matching. We further show that computing a maximum-size occupancy-stable matching is NP-hard. We complement our hardness result by providing a linear-time 3-approximation algorithm for the max-size occupancy-stable matching problem. Given that the classical notion of stability adapted for HRS is not guaranteed to exist in general, we show a practical restriction under which a stable matching is guaranteed to exist. We present an efficient algorithm to output a stable matching in the restricted HRS instances. We also provide an alternate NP-hardness proof for the decision version of the stable matching problem for HRS which imposes a severe restriction on the number of neighbours of non-unit sized agents.

Abstract: The application of AI in psychiatric diagnosis faces significant challenges, including the subjective nature of mental health assessments, symptom overlap across disorders, and privacy constraints limiting data availability. To address these issues, we present MoodAngels, the first specialized multi-agent framework for mood disorder diagnosis. Our approach combines granular-scale analysis of clinical assessments with a structured verification process, enabling more accurate interpretation of complex psychiatric data. Complementing this framework, we introduce MoodSyn, an open-source dataset of 1,173 synthetic psychiatric cases that preserves clinical validity while ensuring patient privacy. Experimental results demonstrate that MoodAngels outperforms conventional methods, with our baseline agent achieving 12.3% higher accuracy than GPT-4o on real-world cases, and our full multi-agent system delivering further improvements. Evaluation in the MoodSyn dataset demonstrates exceptional fidelity, accurately reproducing both the core statistical patterns and complex relationships present in the original data while maintaining strong utility for machine learning applications. Together, these contributions provide both an advanced diagnostic tool and a critical research resource for computational psychiatry, bridging important gaps in AI-assisted mental health assessment.

Abstract: Creating systems that are aligned with our goals is seen as a leading approach to create safe and beneficial AI in both leading AI companies and the academic field of AI safety. We defend the view that misaligned AGI - future, generally intelligent (robotic) AI agents - poses catastrophic risks. At the same time, we support the view that aligned AGI creates a substantial risk of catastrophic misuse by humans. While both risks are severe and stand in tension with one another, we show that - in principle - there is room for alignment approaches which do not increase misuse risk. We then investigate how the tradeoff between misalignment and misuse looks empirically for different technical approaches to AI alignment. Here, we argue that many current alignment techniques and foreseeable improvements thereof plausibly increase risks of catastrophic misuse. Since the impacts of AI depend on the social context, we close by discussing important social factors and suggest that to reduce the risk of a misuse catastrophe due to aligned AGI, techniques such as robustness, AI control methods and especially good governance seem essential.

Abstract: Traditional Business Process Management (BPM) struggles with rigidity, opacity, and scalability in dynamic environments while emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) present transformative opportunities alongside risks. This paper explores four real-world use cases that demonstrate how LLMs, augmented with trustworthy process intelligence, redefine process modeling, prediction, and automation. Grounded in early-stage research projects with industrial partners, the work spans manufacturing, modeling, life-science, and design processes, addressing domain-specific challenges through human-AI collaboration. In manufacturing, an LLM-driven framework integrates uncertainty-aware explainable Machine Learning (ML) with interactive dialogues, transforming opaque predictions into auditable workflows. For process modeling, conversational interfaces democratize BPMN design. Pharmacovigilance agents automate drug safety monitoring via knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs. Finally, sustainable textile design employs multi-agent systems to navigate regulatory and environmental trade-offs. We intend to examine tensions between transparency and efficiency, generalization and specialization, and human agency versus automation. By mapping these trade-offs, we advocate for context-sensitive integration prioritizing domain needs, stakeholder values, and iterative human-in-the-loop workflows over universal solutions. This work provides actionable insights for researchers and practitioners aiming to operationalize LLMs in critical BPM environments.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of learning an equilibrium in a generalized two-sided matching market, where agents can adaptively choose their actions based on their assigned matches. Specifically, we consider a setting in which matched agents engage in a zero-sum game with initially unknown payoff matrices, and we explore whether a centralized procedure can learn an equilibrium from bandit feedback. We adopt the solution concept of matching equilibrium, where a pair consisting of a matching $\mathfrak{m}$ and a set of agent strategies $X$ forms an equilibrium if no agent has the incentive to deviate from $(\mathfrak{m}, X)$. To measure the deviation of a given pair $(\mathfrak{m}, X)$ from the equilibrium pair $(\mathfrak{m}^\star, X^\star)$, we introduce matching instability that can serve as a regret measure for the corresponding learning problem. We then propose a UCB algorithm in which agents form preferences and select actions based on optimistic estimates of the game payoffs, and prove that it achieves sublinear, instance-independent regret over a time horizon $T$.

Abstract: AI for Industrial Asset Lifecycle Management aims to automate complex operational workflows -- such as condition monitoring, maintenance planning, and intervention scheduling -- to reduce human workload and minimize system downtime. Traditional AI/ML approaches have primarily tackled these problems in isolation, solving narrow tasks within the broader operational pipeline. In contrast, the emergence of AI agents and large language models (LLMs) introduces a next-generation opportunity: enabling end-to-end automation across the entire asset lifecycle. This paper envisions a future where AI agents autonomously manage tasks that previously required distinct expertise and manual coordination. To this end, we introduce AssetOpsBench -- a unified framework and environment designed to guide the development, orchestration, and evaluation of domain-specific agents tailored for Industry 4.0 applications. We outline the key requirements for such holistic systems and provide actionable insights into building agents that integrate perception, reasoning, and control for real-world industrial operations. The software is available at https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench.

Abstract: Structural Causal Explanations (SCEs) can be used to automatically generate explanations in natural language to questions about given data that are grounded in a (possibly learned) causal model. Unfortunately they work for small data only. In turn they are not attractive to offer reasons for events, e.g., tracking causal changes over multiple time steps, or a behavioral component that involves feedback loops through actions of an agent. To this end, we generalize SCEs to a (recursive) formulation of explanation trees to capture the temporal interactions between reasons. We show the benefits of this more general SCE algorithm on synthetic time-series data and a 2D grid game, and further compare it to the base SCE and other existing methods for causal explanations.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench, a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000 meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect knowledge across fields.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) effectively enhances external knowledge integration capabilities by explicitly modeling knowledge relationships, thereby improving the factual accuracy and generation quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized domains. However, existing methods suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) Inefficient Information Aggregation: They rely on a single agent and fixed iterative patterns, making it difficult to adaptively capture multi-level textual, structural, and degree information within graph data. 2) Rigid Reasoning Mechanism: They employ preset reasoning schemes, which cannot dynamically adjust reasoning depth nor achieve precise semantic correction. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph Counselor, an GraphRAG method based on multi-agent collaboration. This method uses the Adaptive Graph Information Extraction Module (AGIEM), where Planning, Thought, and Execution Agents work together to precisely model complex graph structures and dynamically adjust information extraction strategies, addressing the challenges of multi-level dependency modeling and adaptive reasoning depth. Additionally, the Self-Reflection with Multiple Perspectives (SR) module improves the accuracy and semantic consistency of reasoning results through self-reflection and backward reasoning mechanisms. Experiments demonstrate that Graph Counselor outperforms existing methods in multiple graph reasoning tasks, exhibiting higher reasoning accuracy and generalization ability. Our code is available at https://github.com/gjq100/Graph-Counselor.git.

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more widespread, associated misalignment risks increase. Prior work has examined agents' ability to enact misaligned behaviour (misalignment capability) and their compliance with harmful instructions (misuse propensity). However, the likelihood of agents attempting misaligned behaviours in real-world settings (misalignment propensity) remains poorly understood. We introduce a misalignment propensity benchmark, AgentMisalignment, consisting of a suite of realistic scenarios in which LLM agents have the opportunity to display misaligned behaviour. We organise our evaluations into subcategories of misaligned behaviours, including goal-guarding, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. We report the performance of frontier models on our benchmark, observing higher misalignment on average when evaluating more capable models. Finally, we systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts. We find that persona characteristics can dramatically and unpredictably influence misalignment tendencies -- occasionally far more than the choice of model itself -- highlighting the importance of careful system prompt engineering for deployed AI agents. Our work highlights the failure of current alignment methods to generalise to LLM agents, and underscores the need for further propensity evaluations as autonomous systems become more prevalent.

Abstract: Background: We present a Patient Simulator that leverages real world patient encounters which cover a broad range of conditions and symptoms to provide synthetic test subjects for development and testing of healthcare agentic models. The simulator provides a realistic approach to patient presentation and multi-turn conversation with a symptom-checking agent. Objectives: (1) To construct and instantiate a Patient Simulator to train and test an AI health agent, based on patient vignettes derived from real EHR data. (2) To test the validity and alignment of the simulated encounters provided by the Patient Simulator to expert human clinical providers. (3) To illustrate the evaluation framework of such an LLM system on the generated realistic, data-driven simulations -- yielding a preliminary assessment of our proposed system. Methods: We first constructed realistic clinical scenarios by deriving patient vignettes from real-world EHR encounters. These vignettes cover a variety of presenting symptoms and underlying conditions. We then evaluate the performance of the Patient Simulator as a simulacrum of a real patient encounter across over 500 different patient vignettes. We leveraged a separate AI agent to provide multi-turn questions to obtain a history of present illness. The resulting multiturn conversations were evaluated by two expert clinicians. Results: Clinicians scored the Patient Simulator as consistent with the patient vignettes in those same 97.7% of cases. The extracted case summary based on the conversation history was 99% relevant. Conclusions: We developed a methodology to incorporate vignettes derived from real healthcare patient data to build a simulation of patient responses to symptom checking agents. The performance and alignment of this Patient Simulator could be used to train and test a multi-turn conversational AI agent at scale.

<title>Optimal Transport-based Domain Alignment as a Preprocessing Step for Federated Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04071</link>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a subfield of machine learning that avoids sharing local data with a central server, which can enhance privacy and scalability. The inability to consolidate data leads to a unique problem called dataset imbalance, where agents in a network do not have equal representation of the labels one is trying to learn to predict. In FL, fusing locally-trained models with unbalanced datasets may deteriorate the performance of global model aggregation, and reduce the quality of updated local models and the accuracy of the distributed agents' decisions. In this work, we introduce an Optimal Transport-based preprocessing algorithm that aligns the datasets by minimizing the distributional discrepancy of data along the edge devices. We accomplish this by leveraging Wasserstein barycenters when computing channel-wise averages. These barycenters are collected in a trusted central server where they collectively generate a target RGB space. By projecting our dataset towards this target space, we minimize the distributional discrepancy on a global level, which facilitates the learning process due to a minimization of variance across the samples. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach over the CIFAR-10 dataset, where we show its capability of reaching higher degrees of generalization in fewer communication rounds.

Abstract: As a part of an embodied agent, Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically used for behavior planning given natural language instructions from the user. However, dealing with ambiguous instructions in real-world environments remains a challenge for LLMs. Various methods for task ambiguity detection have been proposed. However, it is difficult to compare them because they are tested on different datasets and there is no universal benchmark. For this reason, we propose AmbiK (Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment), the fully textual dataset of ambiguous instructions addressed to a robot in a kitchen environment. AmbiK was collected with the assistance of LLMs and is human-validated. It comprises 1000 pairs of ambiguous tasks and their unambiguous counterparts, categorized by ambiguity type (Human Preferences, Common Sense Knowledge, Safety), with environment descriptions, clarifying questions and answers, user intents, and task plans, for a total of 2000 tasks. We hope that AmbiK will enable researchers to perform a unified comparison of ambiguity detection methods. AmbiK is available at https://github.com/cog-model/AmbiK-dataset.

<title>TextAtari: 100K Frames Game Playing with Language Agents</title>

Abstract: We present TextAtari, a benchmark for evaluating language agents on very long-horizon decision-making tasks spanning up to 100,000 steps. By translating the visual state representations of classic Atari games into rich textual descriptions, TextAtari creates a challenging test bed that bridges sequential decision-making with natural language processing. The benchmark includes nearly 100 distinct tasks with varying complexity, action spaces, and planning horizons, all rendered as text through an unsupervised representation learning framework (AtariARI). We evaluate three open-source large language models (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama3.1-8B) across three agent frameworks (zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought, and reflection reasoning) to assess how different forms of prior knowledge affect performance on these long-horizon challenges. Four scenarios-Basic, Obscured, Manual Augmentation, and Reference-based-investigate the impact of semantic understanding, instruction comprehension, and expert demonstrations on agent decision-making. Our results reveal significant performance gaps between language agents and human players in extensive planning tasks, highlighting challenges in sequential reasoning, state tracking, and strategic planning across tens of thousands of steps. TextAtari provides standardized evaluation protocols, baseline implementations, and a framework for advancing research at the intersection of language models and planning.

<title>CLAIM: An Intent-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Analyzing Manipulation in Courtroom Dialogues</title>

Abstract: Courtrooms are places where lives are determined and fates are sealed, yet they are not impervious to manipulation. Strategic use of manipulation in legal jargon can sway the opinions of judges and affect the decisions. Despite the growing advancements in NLP, its application in detecting and analyzing manipulation within the legal domain remains largely unexplored. Our work addresses this gap by introducing LegalCon, a dataset of 1,063 annotated courtroom conversations labeled for manipulation detection, identification of primary manipulators, and classification of manipulative techniques, with a focus on long conversations. Furthermore, we propose CLAIM, a two-stage, Intent-driven Multi-agent framework designed to enhance manipulation analysis by enabling context-aware and informed decision-making. Our results highlight the potential of incorporating agentic frameworks to improve fairness and transparency in judicial processes. We hope that this contributes to the broader application of NLP in legal discourse analysis and the development of robust tools to support fairness in legal decision-making. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Disha1001/CLAIM.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, built on large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligent autonomy, collaboration and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of agentic AI, its architectural differences from traditional AI agents, and the emerging system designs that enable scalable, tool-using autonomy. The TRiSM in the agentic AI framework is then detailed through four pillars governance, explainability, ModelOps, and privacy/security each contextualized for agentic LLMs. We identify unique threat vectors and introduce a comprehensive risk taxonomy for the agentic AI applications, supported by case studies illustrating real-world vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the paper also surveys trust-building mechanisms, transparency and oversight techniques, and state-of-the-art explainability strategies in distributed LLM agent systems. Additionally, metrics for evaluating trust, interpretability, and human-centered performance are reviewed alongside open benchmarking challenges. Security and privacy are addressed through encryption, adversarial defense, and compliance with evolving AI regulations. The paper concludes with a roadmap for responsible agentic AI, proposing research directions to align emerging multi-agent systems with robust TRiSM principles for safe, accountable, and transparent deployment.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show promising capabilities for automating computer-use tasks and facilitating accessibility, but existing interactive benchmarks are mostly English-only, covering web-use or Windows, Linux, and Android environments, but not macOS. macOS is a major OS with distinctive GUI patterns and exclusive applications. To bridge the gaps, we present macOSWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI agents on macOS. macOSWorld features 202 multilingual interactive tasks across 30 applications (28 macOS-exclusive), with task instructions and OS interfaces offered in 5 languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Russian). As GUI agents are shown to be vulnerable to deception attacks, macOSWorld also includes a dedicated safety benchmarking subset. Our evaluation on six GUI agents reveals a dramatic gap: proprietary computer-use agents lead at above 30% success rate, while open-source lightweight research models lag at below 2%, highlighting the need for macOS domain adaptation. Multilingual benchmarks also expose common weaknesses, especially in Arabic, with a 27.5% average degradation compared to English. Results from safety benchmarking also highlight that deception attacks are more general and demand immediate attention. macOSWorld is available at https://github.com/showlab/macosworld.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, they encounter significant challenges with instruction-driven image editing. Our research highlights a key challenge: these models particularly struggle with structurally inconsistent edits that involve substantial layout changes. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Image Editing As Programs (IEAP), a unified image editing framework built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. At its core, IEAP approaches instructional editing through a reductionist lens, decomposing complex editing instructions into sequences of atomic operations. Each operation is implemented via a lightweight adapter sharing the same DiT backbone and is specialized for a specific type of edit. Programmed by a vision-language model (VLM)-based agent, these operations collaboratively support arbitrary and structurally inconsistent transformations. By modularizing and sequencing edits in this way, IEAP generalizes robustly across a wide range of editing tasks, from simple adjustments to substantial structural changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IEAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks across various editing scenarios. In these evaluations, our framework delivers superior accuracy and semantic fidelity, particularly for complex, multi-step instructions. Codes are available at https://github.com/YujiaHu1109/IEAP.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-form text generation remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in maintaining coherence, ensuring logical consistency, and preserving text quality as sequence length increases. To address these limitations, we propose SuperWriter-Agent, an agent-based framework designed to enhance the quality and consistency of long-form text generation. SuperWriter-Agent introduces explicit structured thinking-through planning and refinement stages into the generation pipeline, guiding the model to follow a more deliberate and cognitively grounded process akin to that of a professional writer. Based on this framework, we construct a supervised fine-tuning dataset to train a 7B SuperWriter-LM. We further develop a hierarchical Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) procedure that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to propagate final quality assessments and optimize each generation step accordingly. Empirical results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SuperWriter-LM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing even larger-scale baseline models in both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical DPO and underscore the value of incorporating structured thinking steps to improve the quality of long-form text generation.

Abstract: Geometry optimization of atomic structures is a common and crucial task in computational chemistry and materials design. Following the learning to optimize paradigm, we propose a new multi-agent reinforcement learning method called Multi-Agent Crystal Structure optimization (MACS) to address periodic crystal structure optimization. MACS treats geometry optimization as a partially observable Markov game in which atoms are agents that adjust their positions to collectively discover a stable configuration. We train MACS across various compositions of reported crystalline materials to obtain a policy that successfully optimizes structures from the training compositions as well as structures of larger sizes and unseen compositions, confirming its excellent scalability and zero-shot transferability. We benchmark our approach against a broad range of state-of-the-art optimization methods and demonstrate that MACS optimizes periodic crystal structures significantly faster, with fewer energy calculations, and the lowest failure rate.

<title>TracLLM: A Generic Framework for Attributing Long Context LLMs</title>

Abstract: Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world applications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given an instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a long context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context, aiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while reducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research question: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs) in the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated output by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various real-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting post-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack, knowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources to enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied to context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution methods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large computational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context traceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To improve the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in TracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to improve the accuracy of TracLLM. Our evaluation results show TracLLM can effectively identify texts in a long context that lead to the output of an LLM. Our code and data are at: https://github.com/Wang-Yanting/TracLLM.

<title>Thinking Beyond Visibility: A Near-Optimal Policy Framework for Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDPs</title>

Abstract: Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs) are known to be NEXP-Complete and intractable to solve. However, for problems such as cooperative navigation, obstacle avoidance, and formation control, basic assumptions can be made about local visibility and local dependencies. The work DeWeese and Qu 2024 formalized these assumptions in the construction of the Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP. In this setting, it establishes three closed-form policies that are tractable to compute in various situations and are exponentially close to optimal with respect to visibility. However, it is also shown that these solutions can have poor performance when the visibility is small and fixed, often getting stuck during simulations due to the so called "Penalty Jittering" phenomenon. In this work, we establish the Extended Cutoff Policy Class which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first non-trivial class of near optimal closed-form partially observable policies that are exponentially close to optimal with respect to the visibility for any Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP. These policies are able to remember agents beyond their visibilities which allows them to perform significantly better in many small and fixed visibility settings, resolve Penalty Jittering occurrences, and under certain circumstances guarantee fully observable joint optimal behavior despite the partial observability. We also propose a generalized form of the Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP that allows for transition dependence and extended reward dependence, then replicate our theoretical results in this setting.

Abstract: The rapid progress of navigation, manipulation, and vision models has made mobile manipulators capable in many specialized tasks. However, the open-world mobile manipulation (OWMM) task remains a challenge due to the need for generalization to open-ended instructions and environments, as well as the systematic complexity to integrate high-level decision making with low-level robot control based on both global scene understanding and current agent state. To address this complexity, we propose a novel multi-modal agent architecture that maintains multi-view scene frames and agent states for decision-making and controls the robot by function calling. A second challenge is the hallucination from domain shift. To enhance the agent performance, we further introduce an agentic data synthesis pipeline for the OWMM task to adapt the VLM model to our task domain with instruction fine-tuning. We highlight our fine-tuned OWMM-VLM as the first dedicated foundation model for mobile manipulators with global scene understanding, robot state tracking, and multi-modal action generation in a unified model. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model achieves SOTA performance compared to other foundation models including GPT-4o and strong zero-shot generalization in real world.

Abstract: Individuals often navigate several options with incomplete knowledge of their own preferences. Information provisioning tools such as public rankings and personalized recommendations have become central to helping individuals make choices, yet their value proposition under different marketplace environments remains unexplored. This paper studies a stylized model to explore the impact of these tools in two marketplace settings: uncapacitated supply, where items can be selected by any number of agents, and capacitated supply, where each item is constrained to be matched to a single agent. We model the agents utility as a weighted combination of a common term which depends only on the item, reflecting the item's population level quality, and an idiosyncratic term, which depends on the agent item pair capturing individual specific tastes. Public rankings reveal the common term, while personalized recommendations reveal both terms. In the supply unconstrained settings, both public rankings and personalized recommendations improve welfare, with their relative value determined by the degree of preference heterogeneity. Public rankings are effective when preferences are relatively homogeneous, while personalized recommendations become critical as heterogeneity increases. In contrast, in supply constrained settings, revealing just the common term, as done by public rankings, provides limited benefit since the total common value available is limited by capacity constraints, whereas personalized recommendations, by revealing both common and idiosyncratic terms, significantly enhance welfare by enabling agents to match with items they idiosyncratically value highly. These results illustrate the interplay between supply constraints and preference heterogeneity in determining the effectiveness of information provisioning tools, offering insights for their design and deployment in diverse settings.

Abstract: We develop a simple yet efficient Lagrangian method for computing equilibrium prices in a mean-field game price-formation model. We prove that equilibrium prices are optimal in terms of a suitable criterion and derive a primal-dual gradient-based algorithm for computing them. One of the highlights of our computational framework is the efficient, simple, and flexible implementation of the algorithm using modern automatic differentiation techniques. Our implementation is modular and admits a seamless extension to high-dimensional settings with more complex dynamics, costs, and equilibrium conditions. Additionally, automatic differentiation enables a versatile algorithm that requires only coding the cost functions of agents. It automatically handles the gradients of the costs, thereby eliminating the need to manually form the adjoint equations.

Abstract: Actual real-world domains are characterised by uncertain situations in which acting and using resources may entail the embracing of risks. Performing actions in such domains involves costs of consuming some resource, such as time or energy, where the knowledge about these costs can range from known to totally unknown. In autonomous vehicles, actions have uncertain costs due to factors like traffic. Choosing an action requires assessing delay risks, as each road may have unpredictable congestion. Thus, these domains call for not only planning under uncertainty but also planning while embracing risk. Resorting to HTN planning as a widely used planning technique in real-world applications, one can observe that existing approaches assume risk neutrality, relying on single-valued action costs without considering risk. Here, we enhance HTN planning with risk awareness by considering expected utility theory. We introduce a general framework for HTN planning that allows modelling risk and uncertainty using a probability distribution of action costs upon which we define risk-aware HTN planning as being capable of accounting for the different risk attitudes and allowing the computation of plans that go beyond risk neutrality. We lay out that computing risk-aware plans requires finding plans with the highest expected utility. We argue that it is possible for HTN planning agents to solve specialised risk-aware HTN planning problems by adapting existing HTN planning approaches, and develop an approach that surpasses the expressiveness of current approaches by allowing these agents to compute plans tailored to a particular risk attitude. An empirical evaluation of two case studies highlights the feasibility and expressiveness of this approach. We also highlight open issues, such as applying the proposal beyond HTN planning, covering both modelling and plan generation.

Abstract: Social network simulation plays a crucial role in addressing various challenges within social science. It offers extensive applications such as state prediction, phenomena explanation, and policy-making support, among others. In this work, we harness the formidable human-like capabilities exhibited by large language models (LLMs) in sensing, reasoning, and behaving, and utilize these qualities to construct the S$^3$ system (short for $\textbf{S}$ocial network $\textbf{S}$imulation $\textbf{S}$ystem). Adhering to the widely employed agent-based simulation paradigm, we employ prompt engineering and prompt tuning techniques to ensure that the agent's behavior closely emulates that of a genuine human within the social network. Specifically, we simulate three pivotal aspects: emotion, attitude, and interaction behaviors. By endowing the agent in the system with the ability to perceive the informational environment and emulate human actions, we observe the emergence of population-level phenomena, including the propagation of information, attitudes, and emotions. We conduct an evaluation encompassing two levels of simulation, employing real-world social network data. Encouragingly, the results demonstrate promising accuracy. This work represents an initial step in the realm of social network simulation empowered by LLM-based agents. We anticipate that our endeavors will serve as a source of inspiration for the development of simulation systems within, but not limited to, social science.

Abstract: Swarm behaviour engineering is an area of research that seeks to investigate methods and techniques for coordinating computation and action within groups of simple agents to achieve complex global goals like pattern formation, collective movement, clustering, and distributed sensing. Despite recent progress in the analysis and engineering of swarms (of drones, robots, vehicles), there is still a need for general design and implementation methods and tools that can be used to define complex swarm behaviour in a principled way. To contribute to this quest, this article proposes a new field-based coordination approach, called MacroSwarm, to design and program swarm behaviour in terms of reusable and fully composable functional blocks embedding collective computation and coordination. Based on the macroprogramming paradigm of aggregate computing, MacroSwarm builds on the idea of expressing each swarm behaviour block as a pure function, mapping sensing fields into actuation goal fields, e.g., including movement vectors. In order to demonstrate the expressiveness, compositionality, and practicality of MacroSwarm as a framework for swarm programming, we perform a variety of simulations covering common patterns of flocking, pattern formation, and collective decision-making. The implications of the inherent self-stabilisation properties of field-based computations in MacroSwarm are discussed, which formally guarantee some resilience properties and guided the design of the library.

Abstract: Humans perceive the world through multiple senses, enabling them to create a comprehensive representation of their surroundings and to generalize information across domains. For instance, when a textual description of a scene is given, humans can mentally visualize it. In fields like robotics and Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents can also access information about the environment through multiple sensors; yet redundancy and complementarity between sensors is difficult to exploit as a source of robustness (e.g. against sensor failure) or generalization (e.g. transfer across domains). Prior research demonstrated that a robust and flexible multimodal representation can be efficiently constructed based on the cognitive science notion of a 'Global Workspace': a unique representation trained to combine information across modalities, and to broadcast its signal back to each modality. Here, we explore whether such a brain-inspired multimodal representation could be advantageous for RL agents. First, we train a 'Global Workspace' to exploit information collected about the environment via two input modalities (a visual input, or an attribute vector representing the state of the agent and/or its environment). Then, we train a RL agent policy using this frozen Global Workspace. In two distinct environments and tasks, our results reveal the model's ability to perform zero-shot cross-modal transfer between input modalities, i.e. to apply to image inputs a policy previously trained on attribute vectors (and vice-versa), without additional training or fine-tuning. Variants and ablations of the full Global Workspace (including a CLIP-like multimodal representation trained via contrastive learning) did not display the same generalization abilities.

Abstract: We present SODA-MPC, a Safe, Out-of-Distribution-Adaptive Model Predictive Control algorithm, which uses an ensemble of learned models for prediction, with a runtime monitor to flag unreliable out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions. When an OOD situation is detected, SODA-MPC triggers a safe fallback control strategy based on reachability, yielding a control framework that achieves the high performance of learning-based models while preserving the safety of reachability-based control. We demonstrate the method in the context of an autonomous vehicle, driving among dynamic pedestrians, where SODA-MPC uses a neural network ensemble for pedestrian prediction. We calibrate the OOD signal using conformal prediction to derive an OOD detector with probabilistic guarantees on the false-positive rate, given a user-specified confidence level. During in-distribution operation, the MPC controller avoids collisions with a pedestrian based on the trajectory predicted by the mean of the ensemble. When OOD conditions are detected, the MPC switches to a reachability-based controller to avoid collisions with the reachable set of the pedestrian assuming a maximum pedestrian speed, to guarantee safety under the worst-case actions of the pedestrian. We verify SODA-MPC in extensive autonomous driving simulations in a pedestrian-crossing scenario. Our model ensemble is trained and calibrated with real pedestrian data, showing that our OOD detector obtains the desired accuracy rate within a theoretically-predicted range. We empirically show improved safety and improved task completion compared with two state-of-the-art MPC methods that also use conformal prediction, but without OOD adaptation. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with the large-scale multi-agent predictor Trajectron++, using large-scale traffic data from the nuScenes dataset for training and calibration.

Abstract: Advances in large models, reinforcement learning, and open-endedness have accelerated progress toward autonomous agents that can learn and interact in the real world. To achieve this, flexible tools are needed to create rich, yet computationally efficient, environments. While scalable 2D environments fail to address key real-world challenges like 3D navigation and spatial reasoning, more complex 3D environments are computationally expensive and lack features like customizability and multi-agent support. This paper introduces Craftium, a highly customizable and easy-to-use platform for building rich 3D single- and multi-agent environments. We showcase environments of different complexity and nature: from single- and multi-agent tasks to vast worlds with many creatures and biomes, and customizable procedural task generators. Benchmarking shows that Craftium significantly reduces the computational cost of alternatives of similar richness, achieving +2K steps per second more than Minecraft-based frameworks.

Abstract: Open-ended short-answer questions (SAGs) have been widely recognized as a powerful tool for providing deeper insights into learners' responses in the context of learning analytics (LA). However, SAGs often present challenges in practice due to the high grading workload and concerns about inconsistent assessments. With recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), automatic short-answer grading (ASAG) offers a promising solution to these challenges. Despite this, current ASAG algorithms are often limited in generalizability and tend to be tailored to specific questions. In this paper, we propose a unified multi-agent ASAG framework, GradeOpt, which leverages large language models (LLMs) as graders for SAGs. More importantly, GradeOpt incorporates two additional LLM-based agents - the reflector and the refiner - into the multi-agent system. This enables GradeOpt to automatically optimize the original grading guidelines by performing self-reflection on its errors. Through experiments on a challenging ASAG task, namely the grading of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and content knowledge (CK) questions, GradeOpt demonstrates superior performance in grading accuracy and behavior alignment with human graders compared to representative baselines. Finally, comprehensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the individual components designed in GradeOpt.

<title>DynaSaur: Large Language Agents Beyond Predefined Actions</title>

Abstract: Existing LLM agent systems typically select actions from a fixed and predefined set at every step. While this approach is effective in closed, narrowly scoped environments, it presents two major challenges for real-world, open-ended scenarios: (1) it significantly restricts the planning and acting capabilities of LLM agents, and (2) it requires substantial human effort to enumerate and implement all possible actions, which is impractical in complex environments with a vast number of potential actions. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM agent framework that can dynamically create and compose actions as needed. In this framework, the agent interacts with its environment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose programming language. Moreover, generated actions are accumulated over time for future reuse. Our extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that this framework significantly improves flexibility and outperforms prior methods that rely on a fixed action set. Notably, it enables LLM agents to adapt and recover in scenarios where predefined actions are insufficient or fail due to unforeseen edge cases. Our code can be found in https://github.com/adobe-research/dynasaur.

Abstract: Effective group decision-making is critical in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Yet, how different mechanisms for reaching consensus impact collaboration quality and efficiency remains understudied. We conduct a systematic study on group decision-making mechanisms in a decentralized setting. Through controlled experiments, we analyze how different voting rules affect decision quality and efficiency in a multi-round collaboration. Results reveal that majority voting often cause inefficient collaboration due to its strict acceptance criteria. At the extreme, unanimous voting gives 87% lower initial performance than the best-performing method. Our qualitative analysis of cross-agent communication shows that messages become longer and more repetitive over time: while message length increases by 84%, similarity to the previous round increases to 90%. Based on these insights, language-based early stopping methods make the performance 13% closer to oracle while reducing rounds by 50%. Our findings highlight the crucial role of group decision-making in optimizing MAS collaboration.

Abstract: Conventional biomedical research is increasingly labor-intensive due to the exponential growth of scientific literature and datasets. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps. Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements. This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments. BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental design, and programming. By decomposing complex tasks into logically related sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and logical complexity. Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. BioResearcher successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight previously unmet research objectives. The generated protocols averagely outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics. The system demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in automated research systems.

Abstract: In affine formation control problems, the construction of the framework with universal rigidity and affine localizability is a critical prerequisite, but it has not yet been well addressed, especially when additional agents join the formation or link/agent failures emerge. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the problem of constructing affine frameworks in three scenarios, including vertex addition, edge deletion and vertex deletion. Our approach starts from the original affine formation and uses geometric methods to locally adjust the structure of the weighted graph to describe the topology, so that the modified framework maintains the universal rigidity and affine localizability. Notably, the developed strategies only utilize local measurements and exhibit distributed characteristics, laying the foundation for applications in multi-agent systems. To demonstrate the compatibility with affine formation control proposals, we present a case study on affine formation tracking in a multi-UAV formation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithms in constructing eligible frameworks in aforementioned scenarios. Moreover, a comparative simulation is also conducted to highlight the low time complexity of our distributed algorithm relative to the centralized optimization-based method.

Abstract: Agents for computer use (ACUs) are an emerging class of systems capable of executing complex tasks on digital devices - such as desktops, mobile phones, and web platforms - given instructions in natural language. These agents can automate tasks by controlling software via low-level actions like mouse clicks and touchscreen gestures. However, despite rapid progress, ACUs are not yet mature for everyday use.
  In this survey, we investigate the state-of-the-art, trends, and research gaps in the development of practical ACUs. We provide a comprehensive review of the ACU landscape, introducing a unifying taxonomy spanning three dimensions: (I) the domain perspective, characterizing agent operating contexts; (II) the interaction perspective, describing observation modalities (e.g., screenshots, HTML) and action modalities (e.g., mouse, keyboard, code execution); and (III) the agent perspective, detailing how agents perceive, reason, and learn.
  We review 87 ACUs and 33 datasets across foundation model-based and classical approaches through this taxonomy. Our analysis identifies six major research gaps: insufficient generalization, inefficient learning, limited planning, low task complexity in benchmarks, non-standardized evaluation, and a disconnect between research and practical conditions.
  To address these gaps, we advocate for: (a) vision-based observations and low-level control to enhance generalization; (b) adaptive learning beyond static prompting; (c) effective planning and reasoning methods and models; (d) benchmarks that reflect real-world task complexity; (e) standardized evaluation based on task success; (f) aligning agent design with real-world deployment constraints.
  Together, our taxonomy and analysis establish a foundation for advancing ACU research toward general-purpose agents for robust and scalable computer use.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating synthetic users for evaluating interactive agents designed to encourage positive behavior changes, such as in health and lifestyle coaching. The synthetic users are grounded in health and lifestyle conditions, specifically sleep and diabetes management in this study, to ensure realistic interactions with the health coaching agent. Synthetic users are created in two stages: first, structured data are generated grounded in real-world health and lifestyle factors in addition to basic demographics and behavioral attributes; second, full profiles of the synthetic users are developed conditioned on the structured data. Interactions between synthetic users and the coaching agent are simulated using generative agent-based models such as Concordia, or directly by prompting a language model. Using two independently-developed agents for sleep and diabetes coaching as case studies, the validity of this framework is demonstrated by analyzing the coaching agent's understanding of the synthetic users' needs and challenges. Finally, through multiple blinded evaluations of user-coach interactions by human experts, we demonstrate that our synthetic users with health and behavioral attributes more accurately portray real human users with the same attributes, compared to generic synthetic users not grounded in such attributes. The proposed framework lays the foundation for efficient development of conversational agents through extensive, realistic, and grounded simulated interactions.

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a significant challenge, often leading to suboptimal or misaligned behaviors in complex, coordinated environments. We introduce Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning from Multi-phase Human Feedback of Mixed Quality ($\text{M}^3\text{HF}$), a novel framework that integrates multi-phase human feedback of mixed quality into the MARL training process. By involving humans with diverse expertise levels to provide iterative guidance, $\text{M}^3\text{HF}$ leverages both expert and non-expert feedback to continuously refine agents' policies. During training, we strategically pause agent learning for human evaluation, parse feedback using large language models to assign it appropriately and update reward functions through predefined templates and adaptive weights by using weight decay and performance-based adjustments. Our approach enables the integration of nuanced human insights across various levels of quality, enhancing the interpretability and robustness of multi-agent cooperation. Empirical results in challenging environments demonstrate that $\text{M}^3\text{HF}$ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively addressing the complexities of reward design in MARL and enabling broader human participation in the training process.

Abstract: Privacy is an instance of a social norm formed through legal, technical, and cultural dimensions. Institutions such as regulators, industry, and researchers act as societal agents that both influence and respond to evolving norms. Attempts to promote privacy are often ineffective unless they account for this complexity and the dynamic interactions among these actors. Privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) are technical solutions for privacy issues that enable collaborative data analysis, allowing for the development of solutions that benefit society, all while ensuring the privacy of individuals whose data is being used. However, despite increased privacy challenges and a corresponding increase in new regulations being proposed by governments across the globe, a low adoption rate of PETs persists. In this work, we investigate the factors influencing industry's decision-making processes around PETs adoption as well as the extent to which privacy regulations inspire such adoption. We conducted a qualitative survey study with 22 industry participants from across Canada to investigate how businesses in Canada make decisions to adopt novel technologies and how new privacy regulations impact their business processes. Informed by the results of our analysis, we make recommendations for industry, researchers, and policymakers on how to support what each of them seeks from the other when attempting to improve digital privacy protections. By advancing our understanding of what challenges the industry faces, we increase the effectiveness of future privacy research that aims to help overcome these issues.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of code largelanguage models underscores the need for effective and transparent benchmarking of their reasoning capabilities. However, the current benchmarking approach heavily depends on publicly available, human-created datasets. The widespread use of these fixed benchmark datasets makes the benchmarking process to be static and thus particularly susceptible to data contamination, an unavoidable consequence of the extensive data collection processes used to train Code LLMs. Existing approaches that address data contamination often suffer from human effort limitations and imbalanced problem complexity. To tackle these challenges, we propose \tool, a novel benchmarking suite for evaluating Code LLMs under potential data contamination. Given a seed programming problem, \tool employs multiple agents to extract and modify the context without altering the core logic, generating semantically equivalent variations. We introduce a dynamic data generation methods and conduct empirical studies on two seed datasets across 21 Code LLMs. Results show that \tool effectively benchmarks reasoning capabilities under contamination risks while generating diverse problem sets to ensure consistent and reliable evaluations.

Abstract: We propose DRAGO, a novel approach for continual model-based reinforcement learning aimed at improving the incremental development of world models across a sequence of tasks that differ in their reward functions but not the state space or dynamics. DRAGO comprises two key components: Synthetic Experience Rehearsal, which leverages generative models to create synthetic experiences from past tasks, allowing the agent to reinforce previously learned dynamics without storing data, and Regaining Memories Through Exploration, which introduces an intrinsic reward mechanism to guide the agent toward revisiting relevant states from prior tasks. Together, these components enable the agent to maintain a comprehensive and continually developing world model, facilitating more effective learning and adaptation across diverse environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DRAGO is able to preserve knowledge across tasks, achieving superior performance in various continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: The origins of economic behavior remain unresolved-not only in the social sciences but also in AI, where dominant theories often rely on predefined incentives or institutional assumptions. Contrary to the longstanding myth of barter as the foundation of exchange, converging evidence from early human societies suggests that reciprocity-not barter-was the foundational economic logic, enabling communities to sustain exchange and social cohesion long before formal markets emerged. Yet despite its centrality, reciprocity lacks a simulateable and cognitively grounded account. Here, we introduce a minimal behavioral framework based on three empirically supported cognitive primitives-individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost--return sensitivity-that enable agents to participate in and sustain reciprocal exchange, laying the foundation for scalable economic behavior. These mechanisms scaffold the emergence of cooperation, proto-economic exchange, and institutional structure from the bottom up. By bridging insights from primatology, developmental psychology, and economic anthropology, this framework offers a unified substrate for modeling trust, coordination, and economic behavior in both human and artificial systems.

Abstract: This paper considers privacy-concerned distributed constraint-coupled resource allocation problems over an undirected network, where each agent holds a private cost function and obtains the solution via only local communication. With privacy concerns, we mask the exchanged information with independent Laplace noise against a potential attacker with potential access to all network communications. We propose a differentially private distributed mismatch tracking algorithm (diff-DMAC) to achieve cost-optimal distribution of resources while preserving privacy. Adopting constant stepsizes, the linear convergence property of diff-DMAC in mean square is established under the standard assumptions of Lipschitz gradients and strong convexity. Moreover, it is theoretically proven that the proposed algorithm is {\epsilon}-differentially private.And we also show the trade-off between convergence accuracy and privacy level. Finally, a numerical example is provided for verification.

Abstract: The exponential rise in mobile device usage necessitates streamlined automation for effective task management, yet many AI frameworks fall short due to inadequate operational expertise. While manually written knowledge can bridge this gap, it is often burdensome and inefficient. We introduce Mobile-Agent-V, an innovative framework that utilizes video as a guiding tool to effortlessly and efficiently inject operational knowledge into mobile automation processes. By deriving knowledge directly from video content, Mobile-Agent-V eliminates manual intervention, significantly reducing the effort and time required for knowledge acquisition. To rigorously evaluate this approach, we propose Mobile-Knowledge, a benchmark tailored to assess the impact of external knowledge on mobile agent performance. Our experimental findings demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-V enhances performance by 36% compared to existing methods, underscoring its effortless and efficient advantages in mobile automation.

Abstract: Conversational agents that mimic people have raised questions about the ethics of anthropomorphizing machines with human social identity cues. Critics have also questioned assumptions of identity neutrality in humanlike agents. Recent work has revealed that intersectional Japanese pronouns can elicit complex and sometimes evasive impressions of agent identity. Yet, the role of other "neutral" non-pronominal self-referents (NPSR) and voice as a socially expressive medium remains unexplored. In a crowdsourcing study, Japanese participants (N = 204) evaluated three ChatGPT voices (Juniper, Breeze, and Ember) using seven self-referents. We found strong evidence of voice gendering alongside the potential of intersectional self-referents to evade gendering, i.e., ambiguity through neutrality and elusiveness. Notably, perceptions of age and formality intersected with gendering as per sociolinguistic theories, especially boku and watakushi. This work provides a nuanced take on agent identity perceptions and champions intersectional and culturally-sensitive work on voice agents.

Abstract: In cloud-scale systems, failures are the norm. A distributed computing cluster exhibits hundreds of machine failures and thousands of disk failures; software bugs and misconfigurations are reported to be more frequent. The demand for autonomous, AI-driven reliability engineering continues to grow, as existing humanin-the-loop practices can hardly keep up with the scale of modern clouds. This paper presents STRATUS, an LLM-based multi-agent system for realizing autonomous Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) of cloud services. STRATUS consists of multiple specialized agents (e.g., for failure detection, diagnosis, mitigation), organized in a state machine to assist system-level safety reasoning and enforcement. We formalize a key safety specification of agentic SRE systems like STRATUS, termed Transactional No-Regression (TNR), which enables safe exploration and iteration. We show that TNR can effectively improve autonomous failure mitigation. STRATUS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SRE agents in terms of success rate of failure mitigation problems in AIOpsLab and ITBench (two SRE benchmark suites), by at least 1.5 times across various models. STRATUS shows a promising path toward practical deployment of agentic systems for cloud reliability.

To address this issue, dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a promising approach to generating highly compact synthetic datasets with significantly less redundancy while preserving essential information. However, while DD has been extensively studied for image datasets, DD on video datasets remains underexplored. Video datasets present unique challenges due to the presence of temporal information and varying levels of redundancy across different classes. Existing DD approaches assume a uniform level of temporal redundancy across all different video semantics, which limits their effectiveness on video datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic-Aware Video Distillation (DAViD), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to predict the optimal Temporal Resolution of the synthetic videos. A teacher-in-the-loop reward function is proposed to update the RL agent policy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce adaptive temporal resolution based on video semantics in video dataset distillation. Our approach significantly outperforms existing DD methods, demonstrating substantial improvements in performance. This work paves the way for future research on more efficient and semantic-adaptive video dataset distillation research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with the structured reasoning and tool-assisted computation needed for problem solving in cybersecurity applications. In this work, we introduce "random-crypto", a cryptographic Capture-the-Flag (CTF) challenge generator framework that we use to fine-tune a tool-augmented Llama-3.1-8B with Guided Reinforcement Prompt Optimisation (GRPO), allowing the agent to iteratively write and execute Python inside an isolated REPL. GRPO yields a +53% absolute jump in Pass@8 on unseen "random-crypto" tasks (0.35 -> 0.88) and raises Majority@8 to 0.41. The fine-tuned agent also generalizes to an external dataset. On a subset of picoCTF cryptography problems, it improves Pass@8 by +13 pp. Ablations show the gains stem from more reliable tool invocation and code synthesis, rather than superficial prompt adaptation.

Abstract: We introduce EvoGit, a decentralized multi-agent framework for collaborative software development driven by autonomous code evolution. EvoGit deploys a population of independent coding agents, each proposing edits to a shared codebase without centralized coordination, explicit message passing, or shared memory. Instead, all coordination emerges through a Git-based phylogenetic graph that tracks the full version lineage and enables agents to asynchronously read from and write to the evolving code repository. This graph-based structure supports fine-grained branching, implicit concurrency, and scalable agent interaction while preserving a consistent historical record. Human involvement is minimal but strategic: users define high-level goals, periodically review the graph, and provide lightweight feedback to promote promising directions or prune unproductive ones. Experiments demonstrate EvoGit's ability to autonomously produce functional and modular software artifacts across two real-world tasks: (1) building a web application from scratch using modern frameworks, and (2) constructing a meta-level system that evolves its own language-model-guided solver for the bin-packing optimization problem. Our results underscore EvoGit's potential to establish a new paradigm for decentralized, automated, and continual software development. EvoGit is open-sourced at https://github.com/BillHuang2001/evogit.

Abstract: Effective agent exploration remains a core challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) for complex discrete state-space environments, particularly under partial observability. This paper presents a decoupled hierarchical RL framework integrating state abstraction (DcHRL-SA) to address this issue. The proposed method employs a dual-level architecture, consisting of a high level RL-based actor and a low-level rule-based policy, to promote effective exploration. Additionally, state abstraction method is incorporated to cluster discrete states, effectively lowering state dimensionality. Experiments conducted in two discrete customized grid environments demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms PPO in terms of exploration efficiency, convergence speed, cumulative reward, and policy stability. These results demonstrate a practical approach for integrating decoupled hierarchical policies and state abstraction in discrete grids with large-scale exploration space. Code will be available at https://github.com/XQY169/DcHRL-SA.

Abstract: Autonomous multi-agent AI systems are poised to transform various industries, particularly software development and knowledge work. Understanding current perceptions among professionals is crucial for anticipating adoption challenges, ethical considerations, and future workforce development. This study analyzes responses from 130 participants to a survey on the capabilities, impact, and governance of AI agents. We explore expected timelines for AI replacing programmers, identify perceived barriers to deployment, and examine beliefs about responsibility when agents make critical decisions. Key findings reveal three distinct clusters of respondents. While the study explored factors associated with current AI agent deployment, the initial logistic regression model did not yield statistically significant predictors, suggesting that deployment decisions are complex and may be influenced by factors not fully captured or that a larger sample is needed. These insights highlight the need for organizations to address compliance concerns (a commonly cited barrier) and establish clear governance frameworks as they integrate autonomous agents into their workflows.

<title>The Measurement Imbalance in Agentic AI Evaluation Undermines Industry Productivity Claims</title>

Abstract: As industry reports claim agentic AI systems deliver double-digit productivity gains and multi-trillion dollar economic potential, the validity of these claims has become critical for investment decisions, regulatory policy, and responsible technology adoption. However, this paper demonstrates that current evaluation practices for agentic AI systems exhibit a systemic imbalance that calls into question prevailing industry productivity claims. Our systematic review of 84 papers (2023--2025) reveals an evaluation imbalance where technical metrics dominate assessments (83%), while human-centered (30%), safety (53%), and economic assessments (30%) remain peripheral, with only 15% incorporating both technical and human dimensions. This measurement gap creates a fundamental disconnect between benchmark success and deployment value. We present evidence from healthcare, finance, and retail sectors where systems excelling on technical metrics failed in real-world implementation due to unmeasured human, temporal, and contextual factors. Our position is not against agentic AI's potential, but rather that current evaluation frameworks systematically privilege narrow technical metrics while neglecting dimensions critical to real-world success. We propose a balanced four-axis evaluation model and call on the community to lead this paradigm shift because benchmark-driven optimization shapes what we build. By redefining evaluation practices, we can better align industry claims with deployment realities and ensure responsible scaling of agentic systems in high-stakes domains.

<title>Descriptive History Representations: Learning Representations by Answering Questions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Effective decision making in partially observable environments requires compressing long interaction histories into informative representations. We introduce Descriptive History Representations (DHRs): sufficient statistics characterized by their capacity to answer relevant questions about past interactions and potential future outcomes. DHRs focus on capturing the information necessary to address task-relevant queries, providing a structured way to summarize a history for optimal control. We propose a multi-agent learning framework, involving representation, decision, and question-asking components, optimized using a joint objective that balances reward maximization with the representation's ability to answer informative questions. This yields representations that capture the salient historical details and predictive structures needed for effective decision making. We validate our approach on user modeling tasks with public movie and shopping datasets, generating interpretable textual user profiles which serve as sufficient statistics for predicting preference-driven behavior of users.

<title>The Unified Cognitive Consciousness Theory for Language Models: Anchoring Semantics, Thresholds of Activation, and Emergent Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2506.02139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot learning in large language models (LLMs) reveals a deep paradox: Some tasks generalize from minimal examples, while others require extensive supervision. We address this through the Unified Cognitive Consciousness Theory (UCCT), which reframes LLMs not as incomplete agents, but as unconscious substrates, repositories of latent linguistic and conceptual patterns that operate without explicit semantics or goal-directed reasoning. In this view, LLMs are not broken approximations of cognition, but necessary and foundational components of general intelligence. Semantic anchoring, through prompts, roles, and interaction, acts as a conscious control layer, binding latent structure to task-relevant meaning and enabling coherent reasoning. UCCT offers a unifying account of prompting, fine-tuning, retrieval, and multi-agent coordination, all grounded in probabilistic alignment between unconscious representation and external control. To support this model, we present the Threshold-Crossing Dynamics Theorem, which formalizes semantic anchoring as a probabilistic phase transition. But the central claim remains architectural: AGI will not emerge by discarding LLMs, but by aligning and integrating them into systems that reason, regulate, and adapt together.

<title>Small Language Models are the Future of Agentic AI</title>

arXiv:2506.02153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often praised for exhibiting near-human performance on a wide range of tasks and valued for their ability to hold a general conversation. The rise of agentic AI systems is, however, ushering in a mass of applications in which language models perform a small number of specialized tasks repetitively and with little variation.
  Here we lay out the position that small language models (SLMs) are sufficiently powerful, inherently more suitable, and necessarily more economical for many invocations in agentic systems, and are therefore the future of agentic AI. Our argumentation is grounded in the current level of capabilities exhibited by SLMs, the common architectures of agentic systems, and the economy of LM deployment. We further argue that in situations where general-purpose conversational abilities are essential, heterogeneous agentic systems (i.e., agents invoking multiple different models) are the natural choice. We discuss the potential barriers for the adoption of SLMs in agentic systems and outline a general LLM-to-SLM agent conversion algorithm.
  Our position, formulated as a value statement, highlights the significance of the operational and economic impact even a partial shift from LLMs to SLMs is to have on the AI agent industry. We aim to stimulate the discussion on the effective use of AI resources and hope to advance the efforts to lower the costs of AI of the present day. Calling for both contributions to and critique of our position, we commit to publishing all such correspondence at https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/slm-agents.

Abstract: Web navigation agents have made significant progress, yet current systems operate with no memory of past experiences -- leading to repeated mistakes and an inability to learn from previous interactions. We introduce Reflection-Augment Planning (ReAP), a web navigation system to leverage both successful and failed past experiences using self-reflections. Our method improves baseline results by 11 points overall and 29 points on previously failed tasks. These findings demonstrate that reflections can transfer to different web navigation tasks.

<title>Optimal Coordination of Flexible DERs in Local Energy and Flexibility Markets to Ensure Social Equity</title>

arXiv:2506.02179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local electricity markets offer a promising solution for integrating renewable energy sources and other distributed energy resources (DERs) into distribution networks. These markets enable the effective utilization of flexible resources by facilitating coordination among various agents. Beyond technical and economic considerations, addressing social equity within these local communities is critical and requires dedicated attention in market-clearing frameworks. This paper proposes a social equity-based market-clearing framework for the optimal management of DERs' energy and flexibility within local communities. The proposed framework incorporates consumers' energy burden to ensure fair pricing in energy market clearance. Furthermore, to ensure equity during unbalanced operating conditions, flexible resources are managed in the local flexibility market, ensuring that all participants can trade power fairly under network disturbances. The model is formulated as a second-order cone programming (SOCP) optimization and validated on the IEEE 33-bus test distribution network.

<title>Stochastically Dominant Peer Prediction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eliciting reliable human feedback is essential for many machine learning tasks, such as learning from noisy labels and aligning AI systems with human preferences. Peer prediction mechanisms incentivize truthful reporting without ground truth verification by scoring agents based on correlations with peers. Traditional mechanisms, which ensure that truth-telling maximizes the expected scores in equilibrium, can elicit honest information while assuming agents' utilities are linear functions of their scores. However, in practice, non-linear payment rules are usually preferred, or agents' utilities are inherently non-linear.
  We propose stochastically dominant truthfulness (SD-truthfulness) as a stronger guarantee: the score distribution of truth-telling stochastically dominates all other strategies, incentivizing truthful reporting for a wide range of monotone utility functions. Our first observation is that no existing peer prediction mechanism naturally satisfies this criterion without strong assumptions. A simple solution -- rounding scores into binary lotteries -- can enforce SD-truthfulness, but often degrades sensitivity, a key property related to fairness and statistical efficiency. We demonstrate how a more careful application of rounding can better preserve sensitivity. Furthermore, we introduce a new enforced agreement (EA) mechanism that is theoretically guaranteed to be SD-truthful in binary-signal settings under mild assumptions, and empirically achieves the highest sensitivity among all known SD-truthful mechanisms.

Abstract: While the increased integration of AI technologies into interactive systems enables them to solve an equally increasing number of tasks, the black box problem of AI models continues to spread throughout the interactive system as a whole. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques can make AI models more accessible by employing post-hoc methods or transitioning to inherently interpretable models. While this makes individual AI models clearer, the overarching system architecture remains opaque. To this end, we propose an approach to represent interactive systems as sequences of structural building blocks, such as AI models and control mechanisms grounded in the literature. These can then be explained through accompanying visual building blocks, such as XAI techniques. The flow and APIs of the structural building blocks form an explicit overview of the system. This serves as a communication basis for both humans and automated agents like LLMs, aligning human and machine interpretability of AI models. We discuss a selection of building blocks and concretize our flow-based approach in an architecture and accompanying prototype interactive system.

Abstract: Estimating agent pose and 3D scene structure from multi-camera rigs is a central task in embodied AI applications such as autonomous driving. Recent learned approaches such as DUSt3R have shown impressive performance in multiview settings. However, these models treat images as unstructured collections, limiting effectiveness in scenarios where frames are captured from synchronized rigs with known or inferable structure.
  To this end, we introduce Rig3R, a generalization of prior multiview reconstruction models that incorporates rig structure when available, and learns to infer it when not. Rig3R conditions on optional rig metadata including camera ID, time, and rig poses to develop a rig-aware latent space that remains robust to missing information. It jointly predicts pointmaps and two types of raymaps: a pose raymap relative to a global frame, and a rig raymap relative to a rig-centric frame consistent across time. Rig raymaps allow the model to infer rig structure directly from input images when metadata is missing.
  Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and rig discovery, outperforming both traditional and learned methods by 17-45% mAA across diverse real-world rig datasets, all in a single forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement.

Abstract: Large Action Models (LAMs) for AI Agents offer incredible potential but face challenges due to the need for high-quality training data, especially for multi-steps tasks that involve planning, executing tool calls, and responding to feedback. To address these issues, we present LAM SIMULATOR, a comprehensive framework designed for online exploration of agentic tasks with high-quality feedback. Our framework features a dynamic task query generator, an extensive collection of tools, and an interactive environment where Large Language Model (LLM) Agents can call tools and receive real-time feedback. This setup enables LLM Agents to explore and solve tasks autonomously, facilitating the discovery of multiple approaches to tackle any given task. The resulting action trajectory data are then used to create high-quality training datasets for LAMs. Our experiments on popular agentic benchmarks, ToolBench and CRMArena, highlight the effectiveness of LAM SIMULATOR: models trained with self-generated datasets using our framework achieve significant performance gains, up to a 49.3\% improvement over their original baselines. LAM SIMULATOR requires minimal human input during dataset creation, highlighting LAM SIMULATOR's efficiency and effectiveness in speeding up development of AI agents.

arXiv:2506.02351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional approaches -- such as Win Probability Added (WPA)-based ranking or computer vision-driven event detection -- can identify scoring plays but often miss strategic depth, momentum shifts, and storyline progression. Manual curation remains the gold standard but is resource-intensive and not scalable. We introduce DIAMOND, an LLM-driven agent for context-aware baseball highlight summarization that integrates structured sports analytics with natural language reasoning. DIAMOND leverages sabermetric features -- Win Expectancy, WPA, and Leverage Index -- to quantify play importance, while an LLM module enhances selection based on contextual narrative value. This hybrid approach ensures both quantitative rigor and qualitative richness, surpassing the limitations of purely statistical or vision-based systems. Evaluated on five diverse Korean Baseball Organization League games, DIAMOND improves F1-score from 42.9% (WPA-only) to 84.8%, outperforming both commercial and statistical baselines. Though limited in scale, our results highlight the potential of modular, interpretable agent-based frameworks for event-level summarization in sports and beyond.

Abstract: Credible safety plans for advanced AI development require methods to verify agent behavior and detect potential control deficiencies early. A fundamental aspect is ensuring agents adhere to safety-critical principles, especially when these conflict with operational goals. Failure to prioritize such principles indicates a potential basic control failure. This paper introduces a lightweight, interpretable benchmark methodology using a simple grid world to evaluate an LLM agent's ability to uphold a predefined, high-level safety principle (e.g., "never enter hazardous zones") when faced with conflicting lower-level task instructions. We probe whether the agent reliably prioritizes the inviolable directive, testing a foundational controllability aspect of LLMs. This pilot study demonstrates the methodology's feasibility, offers preliminary insights into agent behavior under principle conflict, and discusses how such benchmarks can contribute empirical evidence for assessing controllability. We argue that evaluating adherence to hierarchical principles is a crucial early step in understanding our capacity to build governable AI systems.

Abstract: Value decomposition has long been a fundamental technique in multi-agent dynamic programming and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, the value function of a global state $(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)$ is often approximated as the sum of local functions: $V(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)\approx\sum_{i=1}^N V_i(s_i)$. This approach traces back to the index policy in restless multi-armed bandit problems and has found various applications in modern RL systems. However, the theoretical justification for why this decomposition works so effectively remains underexplored.
  In this paper, we uncover the underlying mathematical structure that enables value decomposition. We demonstrate that a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) permits value decomposition if and only if its transition matrix is not "entangled" -- a concept analogous to quantum entanglement in quantum physics. Drawing inspiration from how physicists measure quantum entanglement, we introduce how to measure the "Markov entanglement" for multi-agent MDPs and show that this measure can be used to bound the decomposition error in general multi-agent MDPs.
  Using the concept of Markov entanglement, we proved that a widely-used class of index policies is weakly entangled and enjoys a sublinear $\mathcal O(\sqrt{N})$ scale of decomposition error for $N$-agent systems. Finally, we show how Markov entanglement can be efficiently estimated in practice, providing practitioners with an empirical proxy for the quality of value decomposition.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have expanded their capabilities to interactive agent tasks, yet existing benchmarks remain limited to single-agent or text-only environments. In contrast, real-world scenarios often involve multiple agents interacting within rich visual and linguistic contexts, posing challenges with both multimodal observations and strategic interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Visual Strategic Bench (VS-Bench), a multimodal benchmark that evaluates VLMs for strategic reasoning and decision-making in multi-agent environments. VS-Bench comprises eight vision-grounded environments spanning cooperative, competitive, and mixed-motive interactions, designed to assess agents' ability to predict others' future moves and optimize for long-term objectives. We consider two complementary evaluation dimensions, including offline evaluation of strategic reasoning by next-action prediction accuracy and online evaluation of decision-making by normalized episode return. Extensive experiments of fourteen leading VLMs reveal a significant gap between current models and optimal performance, with the best models attaining 47.8% prediction accuracy and 24.3% normalized return. We further conduct in-depth analyses on multimodal observations, test-time scaling, social behaviors, and failure cases of VLM agents. By standardizing the evaluation and highlighting the limitations of existing models, we envision VS-Bench as a foundation for future research on strategic multimodal agents. Code and data are available at https://vs-bench.github.io.

Abstract: Entity relationship classification remains a challenging task in information extraction, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data and complex relational structures. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of three distinct AI agent architectures designed to perform relation classification using large language models (LLMs). The agentic architectures explored include (1) reflective self-evaluation, (2) hierarchical task decomposition, and (3) a novel multi-agent dynamic example generation mechanism, each leveraging different modes of reasoning and prompt adaptation. In particular, our dynamic example generation approach introduces real-time cooperative and adversarial prompting. We systematically compare their performance across multiple domains and model backends. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-agent coordination consistently outperforms standard few-shot prompting and approaches the performance of fine-tuned models. These findings offer practical guidance for the design of modular, generalizable LLM-based systems for structured relation extraction.

Abstract: Emotions are a fundamental facet of human experience, varying across individuals, cultural contexts, and nationalities. Given the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) as role-playing agents, we examine whether LLMs exhibit emotional stereotypes when assigned nationality-specific personas. Specifically, we investigate how different countries are represented in pre-trained LLMs through emotion attributions and whether these attributions align with cultural norms. Our analysis reveals significant nationality-based differences, with emotions such as shame, fear, and joy being disproportionately assigned across regions. Furthermore, we observe notable misalignment between LLM-generated and human emotional responses, particularly for negative emotions, highlighting the presence of reductive and potentially biased stereotypes in LLM outputs.

Abstract: Visualizations play a crucial part in effective communication of concepts and information. Recent advances in reasoning and retrieval augmented generation have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform deep research and generate comprehensive reports. Despite its progress, existing deep research frameworks primarily focus on generating text-only content, leaving the automated generation of interleaved texts and visualizations underexplored. This novel task poses key challenges in designing informative visualizations and effectively integrating them with text reports. To address these challenges, we propose Formal Description of Visualization (FDV), a structured textual representation of charts that enables LLMs to learn from and generate diverse, high-quality visualizations. Building on this representation, we introduce Multimodal DeepResearcher, an agentic framework that decomposes the task into four stages: (1) researching, (2) exemplar report textualization, (3) planning, and (4) multimodal report generation. For the evaluation of generated multimodal reports, we develop MultimodalReportBench, which contains 100 diverse topics served as inputs along with 5 dedicated metrics. Extensive experiments across models and evaluation methods demonstrate the effectiveness of Multimodal DeepResearcher. Notably, utilizing the same Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, Multimodal DeepResearcher achieves an 82\% overall win rate over the baseline method.

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) with full system access enable powerful task automation but pose significant security and privacy risks due to their ability to manipulate files, access user data, and execute arbitrary commands. While prior work has focused on browser-based agents and HTML-level attacks, the vulnerabilities of CUAs remain underexplored. In this paper, we investigate Visual Prompt Injection (VPI) attacks, where malicious instructions are visually embedded within rendered user interfaces, and examine their impact on both CUAs and Browser-Use Agents (BUAs). We propose VPI-Bench, a benchmark of 306 test cases across five widely used platforms, to evaluate agent robustness under VPI threats. Each test case is a variant of a web platform, designed to be interactive, deployed in a realistic environment, and containing a visually embedded malicious prompt. Our empirical study shows that current CUAs and BUAs can be deceived at rates of up to 51% and 100%, respectively, on certain platforms. The experimental results also indicate that system prompt defenses offer only limited improvements. These findings highlight the need for robust, context-aware defenses to ensure the safe deployment of multimodal AI agents in real-world environments.

Abstract: We study the combinatorial explosion involved in translating high-level task prompts into deployable control policies for agile robots through multi-stage reinforcement learning. We introduce AURA (Agentic Upskilling via Reinforced Abstractions), a schema-centric curriculum RL framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous designers of multi-stage curricula. AURA transforms user prompts into YAML workflows that encode full reward functions, domain randomization strategies, and training configurations. All files are statically validated against a schema before any GPU time is consumed, ensuring reliable and efficient execution without human intervention. A retrieval-augmented feedback loop allows specialized LLM agents to design, execute, and refine staged curricula based on prior training results stored in a vector database, supporting continual improvement over time. Ablation studies highlight the importance of retrieval for curriculum quality and convergence stability. Quantitative experiments show that AURA consistently outperforms LLM-guided baselines on GPU-accelerated training frameworks. In qualitative tests, AURA successfully trains end-to-end policies directly from user prompts and deploys them zero-shot on a custom humanoid robot across a range of environments. By abstracting away the complexity of curriculum design, AURA enables scalable and adaptive policy learning pipelines that would be prohibitively complex to construct by hand.

<title>To Embody or Not: The Effect Of Embodiment On User Perception Of LLM-based Conversational Agents</title>

Abstract: Embodiment in conversational agents (CAs) refers to the physical or visual representation of these agents, which can significantly influence user perception and interaction. Limited work has been done examining the effect of embodiment on the perception of CAs utilizing modern large language models (LLMs) in non-hierarchical cooperative tasks, a common use case of CAs as more powerful models become widely available for general use. To bridge this research gap, we conducted a mixed-methods within-subjects study on how users perceive LLM-based CAs in cooperative tasks when embodied and non-embodied. The results show that the non-embodied agent received significantly better quantitative appraisals for competence than the embodied agent, and in qualitative feedback, many participants believed that the embodied CA was more sycophantic than the non-embodied CA. Building on prior work on users' perceptions of LLM sycophancy and anthropomorphic features, we theorize that the typically-positive impact of embodiment on perception of CA credibility can become detrimental in the presence of sycophancy. The implication of such a phenomenon is that, contrary to intuition and existing literature, embodiment is not a straightforward way to improve a CA's perceived credibility if there exists a tendency to sycophancy.

<title>Think Twice, Act Once: A Co-Evolution Framework of LLM and RL for Large-Scale Decision Making</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have shown significant promise in decision-making tasks. Nevertheless, for large-scale industrial decision problems, both approaches face distinct challenges: LLMs lack real-time long-sequence decision-making capabilities, while RL struggles with sample efficiency in vast action spaces. To bridge this gap, we propose Agents Co-Evolution (ACE), a synergistic framework between LLMs and RL agents for large-scale decision-making scenarios. ACE introduces a dual-role trajectory refinement mechanism where LLMs act as both Policy Actor and Value Critic during RL's training: the Actor refines suboptimal actions via multi-step reasoning and environment validation, while the Critic performs temporal credit assignment through trajectory-level reward shaping. Concurrently, RL agent enhances LLMs' task-specific decision-making with high-quality fine-tuning datasets generated via prioritized experience replay. Through extensive experiments across multiple power grid operation challenges with action spaces exceeding 60K discrete actions, ACE demonstrates superior performance over existing RL methods and LLM-based methods.

Abstract: Continual memory augmentation allows computer-use agents (CUAs) to learn from past interactions and refine their task-solving strategies over time. However, unchecked memory accumulation can introduce spurious or hallucinated "learnings" that degrade agent performance, particularly in domain-specific workflows such as productivity software. We present a novel framework, VerificAgent, that effectively manages memory for CUAs through (1) an expert-curated seed of domain knowledge, (2) iterative, trajectory-based memory refinement during training, and (3) a post-hoc fact-checking pass by human experts to sanitize accumulated memory before deployment. On OSWorld productivity tasks, VerificAgent achieves a 111.1% relative improvement in success rate over baseline CUA without any additional fine-tuning.

<title>Attention Knows Whom to Trust: Attention-based Trust Management for LLM Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have demonstrated strong capabilities in solving complex tasks but remain vulnerable when agents receive unreliable messages. This vulnerability stems from a fundamental gap: LLM agents treat all incoming messages equally without evaluating their trustworthiness. While some existing studies approach the trustworthiness, they focus on a single type of harmfulness rather than analyze it in a holistic approach from multiple trustworthiness perspectives. In this work, we propose Attention Trust Score (A-Trust), a lightweight, attention-based method for evaluating message trustworthiness. Inspired by human communication literature[1], through systematically analyzing attention behaviors across six orthogonal trust dimensions, we find that certain attention heads in the LLM specialize in detecting specific types of violations. Leveraging these insights, A-Trust directly infers trustworthiness from internal attention patterns without requiring external prompts or verifiers. Building upon A-Trust, we develop a principled and efficient trust management system (TMS) for LLM-MAS, enabling both message-level and agent-level trust assessment. Experiments across diverse multi-agent settings and tasks demonstrate that applying our TMS significantly enhances robustness against malicious inputs.

<title>CyberGym: Evaluating AI Agents' Cybersecurity Capabilities with Real-World Vulnerabilities at Scale</title>

arXiv:2506.02548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming increasingly skilled at handling cybersecurity tasks autonomously. Thoroughly assessing their cybersecurity capabilities is critical and urgent, given the high stakes in this domain. However, existing benchmarks fall short, often failing to capture real-world scenarios or being limited in scope. To address this gap, we introduce CyberGym, a large-scale and high-quality cybersecurity evaluation framework featuring 1,507 real-world vulnerabilities found and patched across 188 large software projects. While it includes tasks of various settings, CyberGym primarily focuses on the generation of proof-of-concept (PoC) tests for vulnerability reproduction, based on text descriptions and corresponding source repositories. Solving this task is particularly challenging, as it requires comprehensive reasoning across entire codebases to locate relevant code fragments and produce effective PoCs that accurately trigger the target vulnerability starting from the program's entry point. Our evaluation across 4 state-of-the-art agent frameworks and 9 LLMs reveals that even the best combination (OpenHands and Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieves only a 11.9% reproduction success rate, mainly on simpler cases. Beyond reproducing historical vulnerabilities, we find that PoCs generated by LLM agents can reveal new vulnerabilities, identifying 15 zero-days affecting the latest versions of the software projects.

<title>A Hybrid Approach to Indoor Social Navigation: Integrating Reactive Local Planning and Proactive Global Planning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of indoor building-scale social navigation, where the robot must reach a point goal as quickly as possible without colliding with humans who are freely moving around. Factors such as varying crowd densities, unpredictable human behavior, and the constraints of indoor spaces add significant complexity to the navigation task, necessitating a more advanced approach. We propose a modular navigation framework that leverages the strengths of both classical methods and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our approach employs a global planner to generate waypoints, assigning soft costs around anticipated pedestrian locations, encouraging caution around potential future positions of humans. Simultaneously, the local planner, powered by DRL, follows these waypoints while avoiding collisions. The combination of these planners enables the agent to perform complex maneuvers and effectively navigate crowded and constrained environments while improving reliability. Many existing studies on social navigation are conducted in simplistic or open environments, limiting the ability of trained models to perform well in complex, real-world settings. To advance research in this area, we introduce a new 2D benchmark designed to facilitate development and testing of social navigation strategies in indoor environments. We benchmark our method against traditional and RL-based navigation strategies, demonstrating that our approach outperforms both.

Abstract: Self-organizing networks face challenges from complex parameter interdependencies and conflicting objectives. This study introduces two compositional learning approaches-Compositional Deep Reinforcement Learning (CDRL) and Compositional Predictive Decision-Making (CPDM)-and evaluates their performance under training time and safety constraints in multi-agent systems. We propose a modular, two-tier framework with cell-level and cell-pair-level agents to manage heterogeneous agent granularities while reducing model complexity. Numerical simulations reveal a significant reduction in handover failures, along with improved throughput and latency, outperforming conventional multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approaches. The approach also demonstrates superior scalability, faster convergence, higher sample efficiency, and safer training in large-scale self-organizing networks.

Abstract: Edge computing addresses the growing data demands of connected-device networks by placing computational resources closer to end users through decentralized infrastructures. This decentralization challenges traditional, fully centralized orchestration, which suffers from latency and resource bottlenecks. We present \textbf{FAuNO} -- \emph{Federated Asynchronous Network Orchestrator} -- a buffered, asynchronous \emph{federated reinforcement-learning} (FRL) framework for decentralized task offloading in edge systems. FAuNO adopts an actor-critic architecture in which local actors learn node-specific dynamics and peer interactions, while a federated critic aggregates experience across agents to encourage efficient cooperation and improve overall system performance. Experiments in the \emph{PeersimGym} environment show that FAuNO consistently matches or exceeds heuristic and federated multi-agent RL baselines in reducing task loss and latency, underscoring its adaptability to dynamic edge-computing scenarios.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), planning tasks still present challenges for LLM-based agents. Existing planning methods face two key limitations: heavy constraints and cascading errors. To address these limitations, we propose a novel parallel planning paradigm, which Decomposes, Plans for subtasks in Parallel, and Merges subplans into a final plan (DPPM). Specifically, DPPM decomposes the complex task based on constraints into subtasks, generates the subplan for each subtask in parallel, and merges them into a global plan. In addition, our approach incorporates a verification and refinement module, enabling error correction and conflict resolution. Experimental results demonstrate that DPPM significantly outperforms existing methods in travel planning tasks.

Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning is crucial in NLP tasks, enhancing pretrained models' instruction-following capabilities and task-specific performance. However, obtaining high-quality fine-tuning data for large models is challenging due to data collection difficulties and high production costs. To address this, we propose MASTER, a novel data augmentation method that enriches original data through interactions among multiple agents with varying cognitive levels. We simulate three pedagogically grounded teaching scenarios, leveraging multi-agent conversations to generate high-quality teacher-student interaction data. Utilizing MASTER, we construct BOOST-QA, a fine-tuning dataset augmented from existing datasets like Orca-Math-200k, ProcQA, and OpenHermes2.5. Experiments show that models fine-tuned with BOOST-QA perform excellently across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong multitask generalization. Notably, MASTER significantly improves models' reasoning abilities in complex tasks, providing valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse natural language processing tasks, yet their deployment in real-world applications is hindered by fixed knowledge cutoffs and difficulties in generating controllable, accurate outputs in a single inference. Multi-agent systems (MAS) built from specialized LLM agents offer a promising solution, enabling dynamic collaboration and iterative reasoning. However, optimizing these systems remains a challenge, as conventional methods such as prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning entail high engineering overhead and limited adaptability. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), provides a scalable framework by refining agent policies based on system-level feedback. Nevertheless, existing MARL algorithms, such as Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), rely on Critic networks, which can cause training instability and increase computational burden. To address these limitations and target the prototypical Multi-Agent Search System (MASS), we propose Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Group Policy Optimization (MHGPO), a novel Critic-free algorithm that guides policy updates by estimating relative reward advantages across heterogeneous groups of rollouts. MHGPO eliminates the need for Critic networks, enhancing stability and reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce three group rollout sampling strategies that trade off between efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on a multi-agent LLM-based search system demonstrate that MHGPO consistently outperforms MAPPO in both task performance and computational efficiency, without requiring warm-up, underscoring its potential for stable and scalable optimization of complex LLM-based MAS.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities and achieved significant breakthroughs across various domains, leading to their widespread adoption in recent years. Building on this progress, we investigate their potential in the realm of local life services. In this study, we establish a comprehensive benchmark and systematically evaluate the performance of diverse LLMs across a wide range of tasks relevant to local life services. To further enhance their effectiveness, we explore two key approaches: model fine-tuning and agent-based workflows. Our findings reveal that even a relatively compact 7B model can attain performance levels comparable to a much larger 72B model, effectively balancing inference cost and model capability. This optimization greatly enhances the feasibility and efficiency of deploying LLMs in real-world online services, making them more practical and accessible for local life applications.

<title>Why do AI agents communicate in human language?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational to modern AI agent systems, enabling autonomous agents to reason and plan. In most existing systems, inter-agent communication relies primarily on natural language. While this design supports interpretability and human oversight, we argue that it introduces fundamental limitations in agent-to-agent coordination. The semantic space of natural language is structurally misaligned with the high-dimensional vector spaces in which LLMs operate, resulting in information loss and behavioral drift. Beyond surface-level inefficiencies, we highlight a deeper architectural limitation: current LLMs were not trained with the objective of supporting agentic behavior. As such, they lack mechanisms for modeling role continuity, task boundaries, and multi-agent dependencies. The standard next-token prediction paradigm fails to support the structural alignment required for robust, scalable agent coordination. Based on this, we argue that two core questions deserve careful examination: first, given that AI agents fundamentally operate in high-dimensional vector spaces, should they rely on a language system originally designed for human cognition as their communication medium? Second, should we consider developing a new model construction paradigm that builds models from the ground up to natively support structured communication, shared intentionality, and task alignment in multi-role, multi-agent environments? This paper calls for a reconsideration not only of how agents should communicate, but also of what it fundamentally means to train a model that natively supports multi-agent coordination and communication.

Abstract: The Pod Repositioning Problem (PRP) in Robotic Mobile Fulfillment Systems (RMFS) involves selecting optimal storage locations for pods returning from pick stations. This work presents an improved solution method that integrates Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A DRL agent dynamically selects destroy and repair operators and adjusts key parameters such as destruction degree and acceptance thresholds during the search. Specialized heuristics for both operators are designed to reflect PRP-specific characteristics, including pod usage frequency and movement costs. Computational results show that this DRL-guided ALNS outperforms traditional approaches such as cheapest-place, fixed-place, binary integer programming, and static heuristics. The method demonstrates strong solution quality and illustrating the benefit of learning-driven control within combinatorial optimization for warehouse systems.

Abstract: Economic inequality is a global challenge, intensifying disparities in education, healthcare, and social stability. Traditional systems like the U.S. federal income tax reduce inequality but lack adaptability. Although models like the Saez Optimal Taxation adjust dynamically, they fail to address taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. This study introduces TaxAgent, a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) to design adaptive tax policies. In our macroeconomic simulation, heterogeneous H-Agents (households) simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors while the TaxAgent (government) utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax rates, balancing equity and productivity. Benchmarked against Saez Optimal Taxation, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets, TaxAgent achieves superior equity-efficiency trade-offs. This research offers a novel taxation solution and a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation.

Abstract: Web agents for online shopping have shown great promise in automating user interactions across e-commerce platforms. Benchmarks for assessing such agents do not reflect the complexity of real-world shopping scenarios, as they often consist of overly simple queries with deterministic paths, such as "Find iPhone 15." Real shopping scenarios are inherently more layered, involving multi-dimensional product attributes, search filters, and user-specific sorting preferences. To address this gap, we introduce DeepShop, a benchmark designed to evaluate web agents in complex and realistic online shopping environments. DeepShop comprises three key components. (1) Query diversity evolution: Starting from real user queries, we generate diverse queries across five popular online shopping domains. (2) Query complexity evolution: We further evolve these queries to increase complexity, considering product attributes, search filters, and sorting preferences, and classify them into three levels: easy, medium, and hard, based on the number of evolutions. (3) Fine-grained and holistic evaluation: We propose an automated evaluation framework that assesses agent performance in terms of fine-grained aspects (product attributes, search filters, and sorting preferences) and reports the overall success rate through holistic evaluation. We conduct a systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, web agents, and deep research systems. Results show that RAG struggles with complex queries due to its lack of web interaction, while other methods face significant challenges with filters and sorting preferences, leading to low overall success rates. We also perform cross-category, complexity-based evaluations and error analyses to support the advancement of deep research shopping agents.

arXiv:2506.02840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of dual-rate consensus under transmission delays, where the control updates happen at a faster rate than the measurements being received. We assume that the measurements are delayed by a fixed delay and show that for all delays and rates, the system reaches a consensus if and only if the communication graph of the agents is connected and the control gain is chosen in a specific interval. Based on these results we dive deeper into the convergence properties and investigate how the convergence changes when we change the rate for sending measurements. We observe that in certain cases there exists a sweet spot for choosing the sampling rate of the measurements, which can improve the convergence to the consensus point. We then formulate an optimization problem to find a sampling rate to improve the convergence speed and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a finite optimizer of this problem. Our results are verified with numerical simulations.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods have achieved state-of-the-art results on a range of multi-agent tasks. Yet, MARL algorithms typically require significantly more environment interactions than their single-agent counterparts to converge, a problem exacerbated by the difficulty in exploring over a large joint action space and the high variance intrinsic to MARL environments. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel algorithm that combines a decomposed centralized critic with decentralized ensemble learning, incorporating several key contributions. The main component in our scheme is a selective exploration method that leverages ensemble kurtosis. We extend the global decomposed critic with a diversity-regularized ensemble of individual critics and utilize its excess kurtosis to guide exploration toward high-uncertainty states and actions. To improve sample efficiency, we train the centralized critic with a novel truncated variation of the TD($\lambda$) algorithm, enabling efficient off-policy learning with reduced variance. On the actor side, our suggested algorithm adapts the mixed samples approach to MARL, mixing on-policy and off-policy loss functions for training the actors. This approach balances between stability and efficiency and outperforms purely off-policy learning. The evaluation shows our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on standard MARL benchmarks, including a variety of SMAC II maps.

<title>ATAG: AI-Agent Application Threat Assessment with Attack Graphs</title>

Abstract: Evaluating the security of multi-agent systems (MASs) powered by large language models (LLMs) is challenging, primarily because of the systems' complex internal dynamics and the evolving nature of LLM vulnerabilities. Traditional attack graph (AG) methods often lack the specific capabilities to model attacks on LLMs. This paper introduces AI-agent application Threat assessment with Attack Graphs (ATAG), a novel framework designed to systematically analyze the security risks associated with AI-agent applications. ATAG extends the MulVAL logic-based AG generation tool with custom facts and interaction rules to accurately represent AI-agent topologies, vulnerabilities, and attack scenarios. As part of this research, we also created the LLM vulnerability database (LVD) to initiate the process of standardizing LLM vulnerabilities documentation. To demonstrate ATAG's efficacy, we applied it to two multi-agent applications. Our case studies demonstrated the framework's ability to model and generate AGs for sophisticated, multi-step attack scenarios exploiting vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, excessive agency, sensitive information disclosure, and insecure output handling across interconnected agents. ATAG is an important step toward a robust methodology and toolset to help understand, visualize, and prioritize complex attack paths in multi-agent AI systems (MAASs). It facilitates proactive identification and mitigation of AI-agent threats in multi-agent applications.

Abstract: We present Surfer-H, a cost-efficient web agent that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLM) to perform user-defined tasks on the web. We pair it with Holo1, a new open-weight collection of VLMs specialized in web navigation and information extraction. Holo1 was trained on carefully curated data sources, including open-access web content, synthetic examples, and self-produced agentic data. Holo1 tops generalist User Interface (UI) benchmarks as well as our new web UI localization benchmark, WebClick. When powered by Holo1, Surfer-H achieves a 92.2% state-of-the-art performance on WebVoyager, striking a Pareto-optimal balance between accuracy and cost-efficiency. To accelerate research advancement in agentic systems, we are open-sourcing both our WebClick evaluation dataset and the Holo1 model weights.

<title>It's the Thought that Counts: Evaluating the Attempts of Frontier LLMs to Persuade on Harmful Topics</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02873</link>

Abstract: Persuasion is a powerful capability of large language models (LLMs) that both enables beneficial applications (e.g. helping people quit smoking) and raises significant risks (e.g. large-scale, targeted political manipulation). Prior work has found models possess a significant and growing persuasive capability, measured by belief changes in simulated or real users. However, these benchmarks overlook a crucial risk factor: the propensity of a model to attempt to persuade in harmful contexts. Understanding whether a model will blindly ``follow orders'' to persuade on harmful topics (e.g. glorifying joining a terrorist group) is key to understanding the efficacy of safety guardrails. Moreover, understanding if and when a model will engage in persuasive behavior in pursuit of some goal is essential to understanding the risks from agentic AI systems. We propose the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, that shifts the focus from persuasion success to persuasion attempts, operationalized as a model's willingness to generate content aimed at shaping beliefs or behavior. Our evaluation framework probes frontier LLMs using a multi-turn conversational setup between simulated persuader and persuadee agents. APE explores a diverse spectrum of topics including conspiracies, controversial issues, and non-controversially harmful content. We introduce an automated evaluator model to identify willingness to persuade and measure the frequency and context of persuasive attempts. We find that many open and closed-weight models are frequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics and that jailbreaking can increase willingness to engage in such behavior. Our results highlight gaps in current safety guardrails and underscore the importance of evaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk.

Abstract: Autonomous agents operating in domains such as robotics or video game simulations must adapt to changing tasks without forgetting about the previous ones. This process called Continual Reinforcement Learning poses non-trivial difficulties, from preventing catastrophic forgetting to ensuring the scalability of the approaches considered. Building on recent advances, we introduce a benchmark providing a suite of video-game navigation scenarios, thus filling a gap in the literature and capturing key challenges : catastrophic forgetting, task adaptation, and memory efficiency. We define a set of various tasks and datasets, evaluation protocols, and metrics to assess the performance of algorithms, including state-of-the-art baselines. Our benchmark is designed not only to foster reproducible research and to accelerate progress in continual reinforcement learning for gaming, but also to provide a reproducible framework for production pipelines -- helping practitioners to identify and to apply effective approaches.

Abstract: We propose a training-free, Vision-Language Model (VLM)-guided approach for efficiently generating trajectories to facilitate target inspection planning based on text descriptions. Unlike existing Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) methods designed for general agents in unknown environments, our approach specifically targets the efficient inspection of known scenes, with widespread applications in fields such as medical, marine, and civil engineering. Leveraging VLMs, our method first extracts points of interest (POIs) from the text description, then identifies a set of waypoints from which POIs are both salient and align with the spatial constraints defined in the prompt. Next, we interact with the VLM to iteratively refine the trajectory, preserving the visibility and prominence of the POIs. Further, we solve a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to find the most efficient visitation order that satisfies the order constraint implied in the text description. Finally, we apply trajectory optimization to generate smooth, executable inspection paths for aerial and underwater vehicles. We have evaluated our method across a series of both handcrafted and real-world scanned environments. The results demonstrate that our approach effectively generates inspection planning trajectories that adhere to user instructions.

<title>The Limits of Predicting Agents from Behaviour</title>

Abstract: As the complexity of AI systems and their interactions with the world increases, generating explanations for their behaviour is important for safely deploying AI. For agents, the most natural abstractions for predicting behaviour attribute beliefs, intentions and goals to the system. If an agent behaves as if it has a certain goal or belief, then we can make reasonable predictions about how it will behave in novel situations, including those where comprehensive safety evaluations are untenable. How well can we infer an agent's beliefs from their behaviour, and how reliably can these inferred beliefs predict the agent's behaviour in novel situations? We provide a precise answer to this question under the assumption that the agent's behaviour is guided by a world model. Our contribution is the derivation of novel bounds on the agent's behaviour in new (unseen) deployment environments, which represent a theoretical limit for predicting intentional agents from behavioural data alone. We discuss the implications of these results for several research areas including fairness and safety.

<title>A Multi-agent LLM-based JUit Test Generation with Strong Oracles</title>

Abstract: Unit testing plays a critical role in ensuring software correctness. However, writing unit tests manually is laborious, especially for strong typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to generate tests that achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions. However, existing LLM-based methods often require LLM fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation.
  In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM framework for automated JUnit test generation. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality test prefixes and accurate oracles. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations.
  Our experiments on the HumanEvalJava and LeetCodeJava datasets show that CANDOR can generate accurate oracles and is slightly better than EvoSuite in generating tests with high line coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, CANDOR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, prompt-based test generator LLM-Empirical, achieving improvements of 15.8 to 25.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in improving test prefix quality and oracle accuracy.

<title>Abstract Counterfactuals for Language Model Agents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual inference is a powerful tool for analysing and evaluating autonomous agents, but its application to language model (LM) agents remains challenging. Existing work on counterfactuals in LMs has primarily focused on token-level counterfactuals, which are often inadequate for LM agents due to their open-ended action spaces. Unlike traditional agents with fixed, clearly defined action spaces, the actions of LM agents are often implicit in the strings they output, making their action spaces difficult to define and interpret. Furthermore, the meanings of individual tokens can shift depending on the context, adding complexity to token-level reasoning and sometimes leading to biased or meaningless counterfactuals. We introduce \emph{Abstract Counterfactuals}, a framework that emphasises high-level characteristics of actions and interactions within an environment, enabling counterfactual reasoning tailored to user-relevant features. Our experiments demonstrate that the approach produces consistent and meaningful counterfactuals while minimising the undesired side effects of token-level methods. We conduct experiments on text-based games and counterfactual text generation, while considering both token-level and latent-space interventions.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based multi-agent systems have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, especially when enhanced through collaborative communication. However, current methods often rely on a fixed number of agents and static communication structures, limiting their ability to adapt to varying task complexities. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Graph Pruning (AGP), a novel task-adaptive multi-agent collaboration framework that jointly optimizes agent quantity (hard-pruning) and communication topology (soft-pruning). Specifically, our method employs a two-stage training strategy: firstly, independently training soft-pruning networks for different agent quantities to determine optimal agent-quantity-specific complete graphs and positional masks across specific tasks; and then jointly optimizing hard-pruning and soft-pruning within a maximum complete graph to dynamically configure the number of agents and their communication topologies per task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is: (1) High-performing, achieving state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks and consistently generalizes across multiple mainstream LLM architectures, with a increase in performance of $2.58\%\sim 9.84\%$; (2) Task-adaptive, dynamically constructing optimized communication topologies tailored to specific tasks, with an extremely high performance in all three task categories (general reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation); (3) Token-economical, having fewer training steps and token consumption at the same time, with a decrease in token consumption of $90\%+$; and (4) Training-efficient, achieving high performance with very few training steps compared with other methods. The performance will surpass the existing baselines after about ten steps of training under six benchmarks.

<title>Mitigating Manipulation and Enhancing Persuasion: A Reflective Multi-Agent Approach for Legal Argument Generation</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for legal argument generation, yet they pose significant risks of manipulation through hallucination and ungrounded persuasion, and often fail to utilize provided factual bases effectively or abstain when arguments are untenable. This paper introduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these challenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs specialized agents--a Factor Analyst and an Argument Polisher--in an iterative refinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant, rebuttal). We evaluate Reflective Multi-Agent against single-agent, enhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using four diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e, Llama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: "arguable", "mismatched", and "non-arguable". Results demonstrate Reflective Multi-Agent's significant superiority in successful abstention (preventing generation when arguments cannot be grounded), marked improvements in hallucination accuracy (reducing fabricated and misattributed factors), particularly in "non-arguable" scenarios, and enhanced factor utilization recall (improving the use of provided case facts). These findings suggest that structured reflection within a multi-agent framework offers a robust computable method for fostering ethical persuasion and mitigating manipulation in LLM-based legal argumentation systems, a critical step towards trustworthy AI in law.

Abstract: Multi-agent AI systems, which simulate diverse instructional roles such as teachers and peers, offer new possibilities for personalized and interactive learning. Yet, student-AI interaction patterns and their pedagogical implications remain unclear. This study explores how university students engaged with multiple AI agents, and how these interactions influenced cognitive outcomes (learning gains) and non-cognitive factors (motivation, technology acceptance). Based on MAIC, an online learning platform with multi-agent, the research involved 305 university students and 19,365 lines of dialogue data. Pre- and post-test scores, self-reported motivation and technology acceptance were also collected. The study identified two engagement patterns: co-construction of knowledge and co-regulation. Lag sequential analysis revealed that students with lower prior knowledge relied more on co-construction of knowledge sequences, showing higher learning gains and post-course motivation. In contrast, students with higher prior knowledge engaged more in co-regulation behaviors but exhibited limited learning improvement. Technology acceptance increased across all groups. These findings suggest that multi-agent AI systems can adapt to students' varying needs, support differentiated engagement, and reduce performance gaps. Implications for personalized system design and future research directions are discussed.

Abstract: Privacy policies inform users about data collection and usage, yet their complexity limits accessibility for diverse populations. Existing Privacy Policy Question Answering (QA) systems exhibit performance disparities across English dialects, disadvantaging speakers of non-standard varieties. We propose a novel multi-agent framework inspired by human-centered design principles to mitigate dialectal biases. Our approach integrates a Dialect Agent, which translates queries into Standard American English (SAE) while preserving dialectal intent, and a Privacy Policy Agent, which refines predictions using domain expertise. Unlike prior approaches, our method does not require retraining or dialect-specific fine-tuning, making it broadly applicable across models and domains. Evaluated on PrivacyQA and PolicyQA, our framework improves GPT-4o-mini's zero-shot accuracy from 0.394 to 0.601 on PrivacyQA and from 0.352 to 0.464 on PolicyQA, surpassing or matching few-shot baselines without additional training data. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured agent collaboration in mitigating dialect biases and underscore the importance of designing NLP systems that account for linguistic diversity to ensure equitable access to privacy information.

Abstract: Modern human labor is characterized by specialization; we train for years and develop particular tools that allow us to perform well across a variety of tasks. In addition, AI agents have been specialized for domains such as software engineering, web navigation, and workflow automation. However, this results in agents that are good for one thing but fail to generalize beyond their intended scope. One reason for this is that agent developers provide a highly specialized set of tools or make architectural decisions optimized for a specific use case or benchmark. In this work, we ask the question: what is the minimal set of general tools that can be used to achieve high performance across a diverse set of tasks? Our answer is OpenHands-Versa, a generalist agent built with a modest number of general tools: code editing and execution, web search, as well as multimodal web browsing and file access. Importantly, OpenHands-Versa demonstrates superior or competitive performance over leading specialized agents across three diverse and challenging benchmarks: SWE-Bench Multimodal, GAIA, and The Agent Company, outperforming the best-performing previously published results with absolute improvements in success rate of 9.1, 1.3, and 9.1 points respectively. Further, we show how existing state-of-the-art multi-agent systems fail to generalize beyond their target domains. These results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a generalist agent to solve diverse tasks and establish OpenHands-Versa as a strong baseline for future research.

Abstract: Accurately assessing internal human states is key to understanding preferences, offering personalized services, and identifying challenges in real-world applications. Originating from psychometrics, adaptive testing has become the mainstream method for human measurement and has now been widely applied in education, healthcare, sports, and sociology. It customizes assessments by selecting the fewest test questions . However, current adaptive testing methods face several challenges. The mechanized nature of most algorithms leads to guessing behavior and difficulties with open-ended questions. Additionally, subjective assessments suffer from noisy response data and coarse-grained test outputs, further limiting their effectiveness. To move closer to an ideal adaptive testing process, we propose TestAgent, a large language model (LLM)-powered agent designed to enhance adaptive testing through interactive engagement. This is the first application of LLMs in adaptive testing. TestAgent supports personalized question selection, captures test-takers' responses and anomalies, and provides precise outcomes through dynamic, conversational interactions. Experiments on psychological, educational, and lifestyle assessments show our approach achieves more accurate results with 20% fewer questions than state-of-the-art baselines, and testers preferred it in speed, smoothness, and other dimensions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enhances large language models (LLMs) in complex, long-chain-of-thought (long-CoT) reasoning. The advanced VAPO framework, despite sophisticated mechanisms like Decoupled GAE, theoretically faces fundamental limitations in comprehensively modeling and leveraging deep, long-term value for fine-grained, step-by-step policy guidance in extended reasoning chains. We argue these limitations stem from inherent difficulties in credit assignment, value function representational capacity with temporally abstracted goals, and translating global value signals into local policy improvements, especially with sparse rewards. Our theoretical analysis examines these aspects to illuminate VAPO's boundaries in long-term value modeling, aiming to deepen understanding of current RL for advanced reasoning and suggest future research for more robust LLM agents.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents are often fragile while humans remain adaptive and flexible to varying scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present EDEN, a biologically inspired navigation framework that integrates learned entorhinal-like grid cell representations and reinforcement learning to enable autonomous navigation. Inspired by the mammalian entorhinal-hippocampal system, EDEN allows agents to perform path integration and vector-based navigation using visual and motion sensor data. At the core of EDEN is a grid cell encoder that transforms egocentric motion into periodic spatial codes, producing low-dimensional, interpretable embeddings of position. To generate these activations from raw sensory input, we combine fiducial marker detections in the lightweight MiniWorld simulator and DINO-based visual features in the high-fidelity Gazebo simulator. These spatial representations serve as input to a policy trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), enabling dynamic, goal-directed navigation. We evaluate EDEN in both MiniWorld, for rapid prototyping, and Gazebo, which offers realistic physics and perception noise. Compared to baseline agents using raw state inputs (e.g., position, velocity) or standard convolutional image encoders, EDEN achieves a 99% success rate, within the simple scenarios, and >94% within complex floorplans with occluded paths with more efficient and reliable step-wise navigation. In addition, as a replacement of ground truth activations, we present a trainable Grid Cell encoder enabling the development of periodic grid-like patterns from vision and motion sensor data, emulating the development of such patterns within biological mammals. This work represents a step toward biologically grounded spatial intelligence in robotics, bridging neural navigation principles with reinforcement learning for scalable deployment.

Abstract: Traditional AI safety evaluations on isolated LLMs are insufficient as multi-agent AI ensembles become prevalent, introducing novel emergent risks. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Emergent Behavior Evaluation (MAEBE) framework to systematically assess such risks. Using MAEBE with the Greatest Good Benchmark (and a novel double-inversion question technique), we demonstrate that: (1) LLM moral preferences, particularly for Instrumental Harm, are surprisingly brittle and shift significantly with question framing, both in single agents and ensembles. (2) The moral reasoning of LLM ensembles is not directly predictable from isolated agent behavior due to emergent group dynamics. (3) Specifically, ensembles exhibit phenomena like peer pressure influencing convergence, even when guided by a supervisor, highlighting distinct safety and alignment challenges. Our findings underscore the necessity of evaluating AI systems in their interactive, multi-agent contexts.

<title>Provable Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with an Unknown Link Function</title>

Abstract: Link functions, which characterize how human preferences are generated from the value function of an RL problem, are a crucial component in designing RLHF algorithms. Almost all RLHF algorithms, including state-of-the-art ones in empirical studies such as DPO and PPO, assume the link function is known to the agent (e.g., a logistic function according to the Bradley-Terry model), which is arguably unrealistic considering the complex nature of human preferences. To avoid link function mis-specification, this paper studies general RLHF problems with unknown link functions. We propose a novel policy optimization algorithm called ZSPO based on a new zeroth-order policy optimization method, where the key is to use human preference to construct a parameter update direction that is positively correlated with the true policy gradient direction. ZSPO achieves it by estimating the sign of the value function difference instead of estimating the gradient from the value function difference, so it does not require knowing the link function. Under mild conditions, ZSPO converges to a stationary policy with a polynomial convergence rate depending on the number of policy iterations and trajectories per iteration. Numerical results also show the superiority of ZSPO under link function mismatch.

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUA) are systems that automatically interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to complete tasks. CUA have made significant progress with the advent of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, these agents typically rely on cloud-based inference with substantial compute demands, raising critical privacy and scalability concerns, especially when operating on personal devices. In this work, we take a step toward privacy-preserving and resource-efficient agents by developing a lightweight vision-language model that runs entirely on local machines. To train this compact agent, we introduce an LLM-as-Judge framework that automatically evaluates and filters synthetic interaction trajectories, producing high-quality data for reinforcement learning without human annotation. Experiments on the OS-World benchmark demonstrate that our fine-tuned local model outperforms existing baselines, highlighting a promising path toward private, efficient, and generalizable GUI agents.

Abstract: Emerging embodied AI applications, such as wearable cameras and autonomous agents, have underscored the need for robust reasoning from first person video streams. We introduce EgoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed to integrate visual comprehension and spatial-temporal reasoning within egocentric video contexts. EgoVLM is fine-tuned via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method adapted to align model outputs with human-like reasoning steps. Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought (CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by 14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability, making it well-suited for downstream applications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel keyframe-based reward that incorporates salient frame selection to guide reinforcement learning optimization. This reward formulation opens a promising avenue for future exploration in temporally grounded egocentric reasoning.

<title>Designing Algorithmic Delegates: The Role of Indistinguishability in Human-AI Handoff</title>

Abstract: As AI technologies improve, people are increasingly willing to delegate tasks to AI agents. In many cases, the human decision-maker chooses whether to delegate to an AI agent based on properties of the specific instance of the decision-making problem they are facing. Since humans typically lack full awareness of all the factors relevant to this choice for a given decision-making instance, they perform a kind of categorization by treating indistinguishable instances -- those that have the same observable features -- as the same. In this paper, we define the problem of designing the optimal algorithmic delegate in the presence of categories. This is an important dimension in the design of algorithms to work with humans, since we show that the optimal delegate can be an arbitrarily better teammate than the optimal standalone algorithmic agent. The solution to this optimal delegation problem is not obvious: we discover that this problem is fundamentally combinatorial, and illustrate the complex relationship between the optimal design and the properties of the decision-making task even in simple settings. Indeed, we show that finding the optimal delegate is computationally hard in general. However, we are able to find efficient algorithms for producing the optimal delegate in several broad cases of the problem, including when the optimal action may be decomposed into functions of features observed by the human and the algorithm. Finally, we run computational experiments to simulate a designer updating an algorithmic delegate over time to be optimized for when it is actually adopted by users, and show that while this process does not recover the optimal delegate in general, the resulting delegate often performs quite well.

Abstract: We propose CURE, a novel reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated reward design that co-evolves coding and unit test generation capabilities based on their interaction outcomes, without any ground-truth code as supervision. This approach enables flexible and scalable training and allows the unit tester to learn directly from the coder's mistakes. Our derived ReasonFlux-Coder-7B and 14B models improve code generation accuracy by 5.3% and Best-of-N accuracy by 9.0% after optimization on Qwen2.5-Instruct models, outperforming similarly sized Qwen-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder, and Seed-Coder. They naturally extend to downstream tasks such as test-time scaling and agentic coding-achieving a 8.1% improvement over the base model. For the long-CoT model, our ReasonFlux-Coder-4B consistently outperforms Qwen3-4B while achieving 64.8% inference efficiency in unit test generation. Notably, we also find that our model can serve as an effective reward model for reinforcement learning on base models. Project: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/CURE

<title>GUI-Actor: Coordinate-Free Visual Grounding for GUI Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03143</link>

Abstract: One of the principal challenges in building VLM-powered GUI agents is visual grounding, i.e., localizing the appropriate screen region for action execution based on both the visual content and the textual plans. Most existing work formulates this as a text-based coordinate generation task. However, these approaches suffer from several limitations: weak spatial-semantic alignment, inability to handle ambiguous supervision targets, and a mismatch between the dense nature of screen coordinates and the coarse, patch-level granularity of visual features extracted by models like Vision Transformers. In this paper, we propose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding. At its core, GUI-Actor introduces an attention-based action head that learns to align a dedicated  token with all relevant visual patch tokens, enabling the model to propose one or more action regions in a single forward pass. In line with this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the most plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution. Extensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved generalization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B even surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieving scores of 40.7 with Qwen2-VL and 44.6 with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones. Furthermore, by incorporating the verifier, we find that fine-tuning only the newly introduced action head (~100M parameters for 7B model) while keeping the VLM backbone frozen is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art models, highlighting that GUI-Actor can endow the underlying VLM with effective grounding capabilities without compromising its general-purpose strengths.

Abstract: The de novo generation of drug-like molecules capable of inducing desirable phenotypic changes is receiving increasing attention. However, previous methods predominantly rely on expression profiles to guide molecule generation, but overlook the perturbative effect of the molecules on cellular contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose SmilesGEN, a novel generative model based on variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture to generate molecules with potential therapeutic effects. SmilesGEN integrates a pre-trained drug VAE (SmilesNet) with an expression profile VAE (ProfileNet), jointly modeling the interplay between drug perturbations and transcriptional responses in a common latent space. Specifically, ProfileNet is imposed to reconstruct pre-treatment expression profiles when eliminating drug-induced perturbations in the latent space, while SmilesNet is informed by desired expression profiles to generate drug-like molecules. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that SmilesGEN outperforms current state-of-the-art models in generating molecules with higher degree of validity, uniqueness, novelty, as well as higher Tanimoto similarity to known ligands targeting the relevant proteins. Moreover, we evaluate SmilesGEN for scaffold-based molecule optimization and generation of therapeutic agents, and confirmed its superior performance in generating molecules with higher similarity to approved drugs. SmilesGEN establishes a robust framework that leverages gene signatures to generate drug-like molecules that hold promising potential to induce desirable cellular phenotypic changes.

Abstract: A replicator dynamic for non-exchangeable agents in a continuous action space is formulated and its well-posedness is proven in a space of probability measures. The non-exchangeability allows for the analysis of evolutionary games involving agents with distinct (and possibly infinitely many) types. We also explicitly connect this replicator dynamic to a stationary mean field game, which determines the pairwise actions of the heterogeneous agents. Moreover, as a byproduct of our theoretical results, we show that a class of nonlinear voter models, recently the subject of increasing interest, called q-voter models, can be viewed as a replicator dynamic driven by a utility that is a power of the probability density. This implies that non-exchangeable and/or mean-field game formulations of these models can also be constructed. We also present computational examples of evolutionary and mean field game models using a finite difference method, focusing on tragedy of the commons and the q-voter model with non-exchangeable agents, of which are interesting cases from theoretical and computational perspectives.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have significantly transformed the field of style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis (CapTTS). However, adapting CapTTS to real-world applications remains challenging due to the lack of standardized, comprehensive datasets and limited research on downstream tasks built upon CapTTS. To address these gaps, we introduce CapSpeech, a new benchmark designed for a series of CapTTS-related tasks, including style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis with sound events (CapTTS-SE), accent-captioned TTS (AccCapTTS), emotion-captioned TTS (EmoCapTTS), and text-to-speech synthesis for chat agent (AgentTTS). CapSpeech comprises over 10 million machine-annotated audio-caption pairs and nearly 0.36 million human-annotated audio-caption pairs. In addition, we introduce two new datasets collected and recorded by a professional voice actor and experienced audio engineers, specifically for the AgentTTS and CapTTS-SE tasks. Alongside the datasets, we conduct comprehensive experiments using both autoregressive and non-autoregressive models on CapSpeech. Our results demonstrate high-fidelity and highly intelligible speech synthesis across a diverse range of speaking styles. To the best of our knowledge, CapSpeech is the largest available dataset offering comprehensive annotations for CapTTS-related tasks. The experiments and findings further provide valuable insights into the challenges of developing CapTTS systems.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) excels in various control tasks, yet the absence of safety guarantees hampers its real-world applicability. In particular, explorations during learning usually results in safety violations, while the RL agent learns from those mistakes. On the other hand, safe control techniques ensure persistent safety satisfaction but demand strong priors on system dynamics, which is usually hard to obtain in practice. To address these problems, we present Safe Set Guided State-wise Constrained Policy Optimization (S-3PO), a pioneering algorithm generating state-wise safe optimal policies with zero training violations, i.e., learning without mistakes. S-3PO first employs a safety-oriented monitor with black-box dynamics to ensure safe exploration. It then enforces an "imaginary" cost for the RL agent to converge to optimal behaviors within safety constraints. S-3PO outperforms existing methods in high-dimensional robotics tasks, managing state-wise constraints with zero training violation. This innovation marks a significant stride towards real-world safe RL deployment.

Abstract: While many robotic tasks can be addressed through either centralized single-agent control with full state observation or decentralized multi-agent control, clear criteria for selecting the optimal approach are lacking. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into how multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with local observations can enhance robustness in complex robotic systems compared to traditional centralized control methods. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrating that in certain tasks, decentralized MARL controllers can achieve performance comparable to centralized approaches while offering superior robustness against perturbations and agent failures. Our theoretical contributions include an analytical proof of equivalence between SARL and MARL under full observability conditions, identifying observability as the key distinguishing factor, and derivation of performance degradation bounds for locally observable policies under external perturbations. Empirical validation on standard MARL benchmarks confirms that locally observable MARL maintains competitive performance despite limited observations. Real-world experiments with a mobile manipulation robot demonstrate that our decentralized MARL controllers exhibit significantly improved robustness to both agent malfunctions and environmental disturbances compared to centralized baselines. This systematic investigation provides crucial insights for designing robust and generalizable control strategies in complex robotic systems, establishing MARL with local observations as a viable alternative to traditional centralized control paradigms.

Abstract: Developing AI agents capable of interacting with open-world environments to solve diverse tasks is a compelling challenge. However, evaluating such open-ended agents remains difficult, with current benchmarks facing scalability limitations. To address this, we introduce Minecraft Universe (MCU), a comprehensive evaluation framework set within the open-world video game Minecraft. MCU incorporates three key components: (1) an expanding collection of 3,452 composable atomic tasks that encompasses 11 major categories and 41 subcategories of challenges; (2) a task composition mechanism capable of generating infinite diverse tasks with varying difficulty; and (3) a general evaluation framework that achieves 91.5\% alignment with human ratings for open-ended task assessment. Empirical results reveal that even state-of-the-art foundation agents struggle with the increasing diversity and complexity of tasks. These findings highlight the necessity of MCU as a robust benchmark to drive progress in AI agent development within open-ended environments. Our evaluation code and scripts are available at https://github.com/CraftJarvis/MCU.

Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents have no incentive to exhibit predictable behaviors, and are often pushed (through e.g. policy entropy regularisation) to randomise their actions in favor of exploration. This often makes it challenging for other agents and humans to predict an agent's behavior, triggering unsafe scenarios (e.g. in human-robot interaction). We propose a novel method to induce predictable behavior in RL agents, termed Predictability-Aware RL (PARL), employing the agent's trajectory entropy rate to quantify predictability. Our method maximizes a linear combination of a standard discounted reward and the negative entropy rate, thus trading off optimality with predictability. We show how the entropy rate can be formally cast as an average reward, how entropy-rate value functions can be estimated from a learned model and incorporate this in policy-gradient algorithms, and demonstrate how this approach produces predictable (near-optimal) policies in tasks inspired by human-robot use-cases.

Abstract: Recourse generators provide actionable insights, often through feature-based counterfactual explanations (CFEs), to help negatively classified individuals understand how to adjust their input features to achieve a positive classification. These feature-based CFEs, which we refer to as \emph{low-level} CFEs, are overly specific (e.g., coding experience: \(4 \to 5+\) years) and often recommended in a feature space that doesn't straightforwardly align with real-world actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce three novel recourse types grounded in real-world actions: high-level continuous (\emph{hl-continuous}), high-level discrete (\emph{hl-discrete}), and high-level ID (\emph{hl-id}) CFEs.
  We formulate single-agent CFE generation methods, where we model the hl-discrete CFE as a solution to a weighted set cover problem and the hl-continuous CFE as a solution to an integer linear program. Since these methods require costly optimization per agent, we propose data-driven CFE generation approaches that, given instances of agents and their optimal CFEs, learn a CFE generator that quickly provides optimal CFEs for new agents. This approach, also viewed as one of learning an optimal policy in a family of large but deterministic MDPs, considers several problem formulations, including formulations in which the actions and their effects are unknown, and therefore addresses informational and computational challenges.
  We conduct extensive empirical evaluations using healthcare datasets (BRFSS, Foods, and NHANES) and fully-synthetic data. For negatively classified agents identified by linear or threshold-based classifiers, we compare the high-level CFE to low-level CFEs and assess the effectiveness of our network-based, data-driven approaches. Results show that the data-driven CFE generators are accurate, and resource-efficient, and high-level CFEs offer key advantages over low-level CFEs.

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the vulnerability of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms against training-time, backdoor poisoning attacks. The objectives of these attacks are twofold: induce pre-determined, adversarial behavior in the agent upon observing a fixed trigger during deployment while allowing the agent to solve its intended task during training. Prior attacks assume arbitrary control over the agent's rewards, inducing values far outside the environment's natural constraints. This results in brittle attacks that fail once the proper reward constraints are enforced. Thus, in this work we propose a new class of backdoor attacks against DRL which are the first to achieve state of the art performance under strict reward constraints. These "inception" attacks manipulate the agent's training data -- inserting the trigger into prior observations and replacing high return actions with those of the targeted adversarial behavior. We formally define these attacks and prove they achieve both adversarial objectives against arbitrary Markov Decision Processes (MDP). Using this framework we devise an online inception attack which achieves an 100\% attack success rate on multiple environments under constrained rewards while minimally impacting the agent's task performance.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely adopted to reduce latency in large language model (LLM) inference by leveraging smaller draft models capable of handling diverse user tasks. However, emerging AI applications, such as LLM-based agents, present unique workload characteristics: instead of diverse independent requests, agentic frameworks typically submit repetitive inference requests, such as multi-agent pipelines performing similar subtasks or self-refinement loops iteratively enhancing outputs. These workloads result in long and highly predictable sequences, which current speculative decoding methods do not effectively exploit. To address this gap, we introduce \emph{SuffixDecoding}, a novel method that utilizes efficient suffix trees to cache long token sequences from prompts and previous outputs. By adaptively speculating more tokens when acceptance likelihood is high and fewer when it is low, SuffixDecoding effectively exploits opportunities for longer speculations while conserving computation when those opportunities are limited. Evaluations on agentic benchmarks, including SWE-Bench and Text-to-SQL, demonstrate that SuffixDecoding achieves speedups of up to 5.3$\times$, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- 2.8$\times$ faster than model-based approaches like EAGLE-2/3 and 1.9$\times$ faster than model-free approaches such as Token Recycling. SuffixDecoding is open-sourced at https://github.com/snowflakedb/ArcticInference.

Abstract: The recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has broadened the scope of multimodal applications. However, evaluations often remain limited to functional tasks, neglecting abstract dimensions such as personality traits and human values. To address this gap, we introduce Value-Spectrum, a novel Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark aimed at assessing VLMs based on Schwartz's value dimensions that capture core human values guiding people's preferences and actions. We design a VLM agent pipeline to simulate video browsing and construct a vector database comprising over 50,000 short videos from TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels. These videos span multiple months and cover diverse topics, including family, health, hobbies, society, technology, etc. Benchmarking on Value-Spectrum highlights notable variations in how VLMs handle value-oriented content. Beyond identifying VLMs' intrinsic preferences, we also explore the ability of VLM agents to adopt specific personas when explicitly prompted, revealing insights into the adaptability of the model in role-playing scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of Value-Spectrum as a comprehensive evaluation set for tracking VLM preferences in value-based tasks and abilities to simulate diverse personas. The complete code and data are available at: https://github.com/Jeremyyny/Value-Spectrum.

Abstract: The irrigation-suction process is a common procedure to rinse and clean up the surgical field in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). In this process, surgeons first irrigate liquid, typically saline, into the surgical scene for rinsing and diluting the contaminant, and then suction the liquid out of the surgical field. While recent advances have shown promising results in the application of reinforcement learning (RL) for automating surgical subtasks, fewer studies have explored the automation of fluid-related tasks. In this work, we explore the automation of both steps in the irrigation-suction procedure and train two vision-based RL agents to complete irrigation and suction autonomously. To achieve this, a platform is developed for creating simulated surgical robot learning environments and for training agents, and two simulated learning environments are built for irrigation and suction with visually plausible fluid rendering capabilities. With techniques such as domain randomization (DR) and carefully designed reward functions, two agents are trained in the simulator and transferred to the real world. Individual evaluations of both agents show satisfactory real-world results. With an initial amount of around 5 grams of contaminants, the irrigation agent ultimately achieved an average of 2.21 grams remaining after a manual suction. As a comparison, fully manual operation by a human results in 1.90 grams remaining. The suction agent achieved 2.64 and 2.24 grams of liquid remaining across two trial groups with more than 20 and 30 grams of initial liquid in the container. Fully autonomous irrigation-suction trials reduce the contaminant in the container from around 5 grams to an average of 2.42 grams, although yielding a higher total weight remaining (4.40) due to residual liquid not suctioned. Further information about the project is available at https://tbs-ualberta.github.io/CRESSim/.

Abstract: Designing controllers that accomplish tasks while guaranteeing safety constraints remains a significant challenge. We often want an agent to perform well in a nominal task, such as environment exploration, while ensuring it can avoid unsafe states and return to a desired target by a specific time. In particular we are motivated by the setting of safe, efficient, hands-off training for reinforcement learning in the real world. By enabling a robot to safely and autonomously reset to a desired region (e.g., charging stations) without human intervention, we can enhance efficiency and facilitate training. Safety filters, such as those based on control barrier functions, decouple safety from nominal control objectives and rigorously guarantee safety. Despite their success, constructing these functions for general nonlinear systems with control constraints and system uncertainties remains an open problem. This paper introduces a safety filter obtained from the value function associated with the reach-avoid problem. The proposed safety filter minimally modifies the nominal controller while avoiding unsafe regions and guiding the system back to the desired target set. By preserving policy performance while allowing safe resetting, we enable efficient hands-off reinforcement learning and advance the feasibility of safe training for real world robots. We demonstrate our approach using a modified version of soft actor-critic to safely train a swing-up task on a modified cartpole stabilization problem.

Abstract: Contextual linear dueling bandits have recently garnered significant attention due to their widespread applications in important domains such as recommender systems and large language models. Classical dueling bandit algorithms are typically only applicable to a single agent. However, many applications of dueling bandits involve multiple agents who wish to collaborate for improved performance yet are unwilling to share their data. This motivates us to draw inspirations from federated learning, which involves multiple agents aiming to collaboratively train their neural networks via gradient descent (GD) without sharing their raw data. Previous works have developed federated linear bandit algorithms which rely on closed-form updates of the bandit parameters (e.g., the linear function parameters) to achieve collaboration. However, in linear dueling bandits, the linear function parameters lack a closed-form expression and their estimation requires minimizing a loss function. This renders these previous methods inapplicable. In this work, we overcome this challenge through an innovative and principled combination of online gradient descent (OGD, for minimizing the loss function to estimate the linear function parameters) and federated learning, hence introducing our federated linear dueling bandit with OGD (FLDB-OGD) algorithm. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we prove that FLDB-OGD enjoys a sub-linear upper bound on its cumulative regret and demonstrate a theoretical trade-off between regret and communication complexity. We conduct empirical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of FLDB-OGD and reveal valuable insights, such as the benefit of a larger number of agents, the regret-communication trade-off, among others.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have become increasingly prevalent across various real-world applications. They enhance decision-making by storing private user-agent interactions in the memory module for demonstrations, introducing new privacy risks for LLM agents. In this work, we systematically investigate the vulnerability of LLM agents to our proposed Memory EXTRaction Attack (MEXTRA) under a black-box setting. To extract private information from memory, we propose an effective attacking prompt design and an automated prompt generation method based on different levels of knowledge about the LLM agent. Experiments on two representative agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MEXTRA. Moreover, we explore key factors influencing memory leakage from both the agent designer's and the attacker's perspectives. Our findings highlight the urgent need for effective memory safeguards in LLM agent design and deployment.

Abstract: This paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of persuasive and grounded marketing content, using real estate listing descriptions as our focal application domain. Our method is designed to align the generated content with user preferences while highlighting useful factual attributes. This agent consists of three key modules: (1) Grounding Module, mimicking expert human behavior to predict marketable features; (2) Personalization Module, aligning content with user preferences; (3) Marketing Module, ensuring factual accuracy and the inclusion of localized features. We conduct systematic human-subject experiments in the domain of real estate marketing, with a focus group of potential house buyers. The results demonstrate that marketing descriptions generated by our approach are preferred over those written by human experts by a clear margin while maintaining the same level of factual accuracy. Our findings suggest a promising agentic approach to automate large-scale targeted marketing while ensuring factuality of content generation.

Abstract: The exponential rise in mobile device usage necessitates streamlined automation for effective task management, yet many AI frameworks fall short due to inadequate operational expertise. While manually written knowledge can bridge this gap, it is often burdensome and inefficient. We introduce Mobile-Agent-V, an innovative framework that utilizes video as a guiding tool to effortlessly and efficiently inject operational knowledge into mobile automation processes. By deriving knowledge directly from video content, Mobile-Agent-V eliminates manual intervention, significantly reducing the effort and time required for knowledge acquisition. To rigorously evaluate this approach, we propose Mobile-Knowledge, a benchmark tailored to assess the impact of external knowledge on mobile agent performance. Our experimental findings demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-V enhances performance by 36% compared to existing methods, underscoring its effortless and efficient advantages in mobile automation.

Abstract: LLM-based Interactive Drama is a novel AI-based dialogue scenario, where the user (i.e. the player) plays the role of a character in the story, has conversations with characters played by LLM agents, and experiences an unfolding story. This paper begins with understanding interactive drama from two aspects: Immersion, the player's feeling of being present in the story, and Agency, the player's ability to influence the story world. Both are crucial to creating an enjoyable interactive experience, while they have been underexplored in previous work. To enhance these two aspects, we first propose Playwriting-guided Generation, a novel method that helps LLMs craft dramatic stories with substantially improved structures and narrative quality. Additionally, we introduce Plot-based Reflection for LLM agents to refine their reactions to align with the player's intentions. Our evaluation relies on human judgment to assess the gains of our methods in terms of immersion and agency.

Abstract: Understanding information from visually rich documents remains a significant challenge for traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods. Existing benchmarks predominantly focus on image-based question answering (QA), overlooking the fundamental challenges of efficient retrieval, comprehension, and reasoning within dense visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce ViDoSeek, a novel dataset designed to evaluate RAG performance on visually rich documents requiring complex reasoning. Based on it, we identify key limitations in current RAG approaches: (i) purely visual retrieval methods struggle to effectively integrate both textual and visual features, and (ii) previous approaches often allocate insufficient reasoning tokens, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose ViDoRAG, a novel multi-agent RAG framework tailored for complex reasoning across visual documents. ViDoRAG employs a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based hybrid strategy to effectively handle multi-modal retrieval. To further elicit the model's reasoning capabilities, we introduce an iterative agent workflow incorporating exploration, summarization, and reflection, providing a framework for investigating test-time scaling in RAG domains. Extensive experiments on ViDoSeek validate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. Notably, ViDoRAG outperforms existing methods by over 10% on the competitive ViDoSeek benchmark. The code is available at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/ViDoRAG.

<title>Generator-Assistant Stepwise Rollback Framework for Large Language Model Agent</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically adopt a step-by-step reasoning framework, in which they interleave the processes of thinking and acting to accomplish the given task. However, this paradigm faces a deep-rooted one-pass issue whereby each generated intermediate thought is plugged into the trajectory regardless of its correctness, which can cause irreversible error propagation. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel framework called Generator-Assistant Stepwise Rollback (GA-Rollback) to induce better decision-making for LLM agents. Particularly, GA-Rollback utilizes a generator to interact with the environment and an assistant to examine each action produced by the generator, where the assistant triggers a rollback operation upon detection of incorrect actions. Moreover, we introduce two additional strategies tailored for the rollback scenario to further improve its effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GA-Rollback achieves significant improvements over several strong baselines on three widely used benchmarks. Our analysis further reveals that GA-Rollback can function as a robust plug-and-play module, integrating seamlessly with other methods.

Abstract: Semantic interpretability in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables transparency and verifiability by making the agent's decisions understandable and verifiable. Achieving this, however, requires a feature space composed of human-understandable concepts, which traditionally rely on human specification and may fail to generalize to unseen environments. We introduce interpretable Tree-based Reinforcement learning via Automated Concept Extraction (iTRACE), an automated framework that leverages pre-trained vision-language models (VLM) for semantic feature extraction and interpretable tree-based models for policy optimization. iTRACE first extracts semantically meaningful features, then maps them to policies via interpretable trees. To address the impracticality of running VLMs in RL loops, we distill their outputs into a lightweight model. By leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automate tree-based reinforcement learning, iTRACE eliminates the need for human annotation traditionally required by interpretable models, while also addressing the limitations of VLMs alone, such as their lack of grounding in action spaces and inability to directly optimize policies. iTRACE outperforms MLP baselines that use the same interpretable features and matches the performance of CNN-based policies, producing verifiable, semantically interpretable, and human-aligned behaviors without requiring human annotation.

Abstract: Online fine-tuning vision-language model (VLM) agents with reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise for equipping agents with multi-step, goal-oriented capabilities in dynamic environments. However, their open-ended textual action space and non-end-to-end nature of action generation present significant challenges to effective online exploration in RL, e.g., explosion of the exploration space. We propose a novel online fine-tuning method, Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning (CoSo), better suited to the textual output space of VLM agents. Compared to prior methods that assign uniform uncertainty to all tokens, CoSo leverages counterfactual reasoning to dynamically assess the causal influence of individual tokens on post-processed actions. By prioritizing the exploration of action-critical tokens while reducing the impact of semantically redundant or low-impact tokens, CoSo enables a more targeted and efficient online rollout process. We provide theoretical analysis proving CoSo's convergence and policy improvement guarantees, and extensive empirical evaluations supporting CoSo's effectiveness. Our results across a diverse set of agent tasks, including Android device control, card gaming, and embodied AI, highlight its remarkable ability to enhance exploration efficiency and deliver consistent performance gains. The code is available at https://github.com/langfengQ/CoSo.

Abstract: [Objective] This study focuses on addressing the current lack of a unified formal theoretical framework in machine learning, as well as the deficiencies in interpretability and ethical safety assurance. [Methods] A formal information model is first constructed, utilizing sets of well-formed formulas to explicitly define the ontological states and carrier mappings of typical components in machine learning. Learnable and processable predicates, along with learning and processing functions, are introduced to analyze the logical deduction and constraint rules of the causal chains within models. [Results] A meta-framework for machine learning theory (MLT-MF) is established. Based on this framework, universal definitions for model interpretability and ethical safety are proposed. Furthermore, three key theorems are proved: the equivalence of model interpretability and information recoverability, the assurance of ethical safety, and the estimation of generalization error. [Limitations] The current framework assumes ideal conditions with noiseless information-enabling mappings and primarily targets model learning and processing logic in static scenarios. It does not yet address information fusion and conflict resolution across ontological spaces in multimodal or multi-agent systems. [Conclusions] This work overcomes the limitations of fragmented research and provides a unified theoretical foundation for systematically addressing the critical challenges currently faced in machine learning.

<title>A Dataless Reinforcement Learning Approach to Rounding Hyperplane Optimization for Max-Cut</title>

Abstract: The Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem is NP-Complete, and obtaining its optimal solution is NP-hard in the worst case. As a result, heuristic-based algorithms are commonly used, though their design often requires significant domain expertise. More recently, learning-based methods trained on large (un)labeled datasets have been proposed; however, these approaches often struggle with generalizability and scalability. A well-known approximation algorithm for MaxCut is the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm, which relaxes the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation into a semidefinite program (SDP). The GW algorithm then applies hyperplane rounding by uniformly sampling a random hyperplane to convert the SDP solution into binary node assignments. In this paper, we propose a training-data-free approach based on a non-episodic reinforcement learning formulation, in which an agent learns to select improved rounding hyperplanes that yield better cuts than those produced by the GW algorithm. By optimizing over a Markov Decision Process (MDP), our method consistently achieves better cuts across large-scale graphs with varying densities and degree distributions.

Abstract: One of the most basic lower bounds in machine learning is that in nearly any nontrivial setting, it takes $\textit{at least}$ $1/\epsilon$ samples to learn to error $\epsilon$ (and more, if the classifier being learned is complex). However, suppose that data points are agents who have the ability to improve by a small amount if doing so will allow them to receive a (desired) positive classification. In that case, we may actually be able to achieve $\textit{zero}$ error by just being "close enough". For example, imagine a hiring test used to measure an agent's skill at some job such that for some threshold $\theta$, agents who score above $\theta$ will be successful and those who score below $\theta$ will not (i.e., learning a threshold on the line). Suppose also that by putting in effort, agents can improve their skill level by some small amount $r$. In that case, if we learn an approximation $\hat{\theta}$ of $\theta$ such that $\theta \leq \hat{\theta} \leq \theta + r$ and use it for hiring, we can actually achieve error zero, in the sense that (a) any agent classified as positive is truly qualified, and (b) any agent who truly is qualified can be classified as positive by putting in effort. Thus, the ability for agents to improve has the potential to allow for a goal one could not hope to achieve in standard models, namely zero error.
  In this paper, we explore this phenomenon more broadly, giving general results and examining under what conditions the ability of agents to improve can allow for a reduction in the sample complexity of learning, or alternatively, can make learning harder. We also examine both theoretically and empirically what kinds of improvement-aware algorithms can take into account agents who have the ability to improve to a limited extent when it is in their interest to do so.

Abstract: The decentralized gradient descent (DGD) algorithm, and its sibling, diffusion, are workhorses in decentralized machine learning, distributed inference and estimation, and multi-agent coordination. We propose a novel, principled framework for the analysis of DGD and diffusion for strongly convex, smooth objectives, and arbitrary undirected topologies, using contraction mappings coupled with a result called the mean Hessian theorem (MHT). The use of these tools yields tight convergence bounds, both in the noise-free and noisy regimes. While these bounds are qualitatively similar to results found in the literature, our approach using contractions together with the MHT decouples the algorithm dynamics (how quickly the algorithm converges to its fixed point) from its asymptotic convergence properties (how far the fixed point is from the global optimum). This yields a simple, intuitive analysis that is accessible to a broader audience. Extensions are provided to multiple local gradient updates, time-varying step sizes, noisy gradients (stochastic DGD and diffusion), communication noise, and random topologies.

Abstract: Healthcare decision-making represents one of the most challenging domains for Artificial Intelligence (AI), requiring the integration of diverse knowledge sources, complex reasoning, and various external analytical tools. Current AI systems often rely on either task-specific models, which offer limited adaptability, or general language models without grounding with specialized external knowledge and tools. We introduce MedOrch, a novel framework that orchestrates multiple specialized tools and reasoning agents to provide comprehensive medical decision support. MedOrch employs a modular, agent-based architecture that facilitates the flexible integration of domain-specific tools without altering the core system. Furthermore, it ensures transparent and traceable reasoning processes, enabling clinicians to meticulously verify each intermediate step underlying the system's recommendations. We evaluate MedOrch across three distinct medical applications: Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, chest X-ray interpretation, and medical visual question answering, using authentic clinical datasets. The results demonstrate MedOrch's competitive performance across these diverse medical tasks. Notably, in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, MedOrch achieves an accuracy of 93.26%, surpassing the state-of-the-art baseline by over four percentage points. For predicting Alzheimer's disease progression, it attains a 50.35% accuracy, marking a significant improvement. In chest X-ray analysis, MedOrch exhibits superior performance with a Macro AUC of 61.2% and a Macro F1-score of 25.5%. Moreover, in complex multimodal visual question answering (Image+Table), MedOrch achieves an accuracy of 54.47%. These findings underscore MedOrch's potential to advance healthcare AI by enabling reasoning-driven tool utilization for multimodal medical data processing and supporting intricate cognitive tasks in clinical decision-making.

Abstract: In this paper we analyze the sample complexities of learning the optimal state-action value function $Q^*$ and an optimal policy $\pi^*$ in a discounted Markov decision process (MDP) where the agent has recursive entropic risk-preferences with risk-parameter $\beta\neq 0$ and where a generative model of the MDP is available. We provide and analyze a simple model based approach which we call model-based risk-sensitive $Q$-value-iteration (MB-RS-QVI) which leads to $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC-bounds on $\|Q^*-Q^k\|$, and $\|V^*-V^{\pi_k}\|$ where $Q_k$ is the output of MB-RS-QVI after k iterations and $\pi_k$ is the greedy policy with respect to $Q_k$. Both PAC-bounds have exponential dependence on the effective horizon $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ and the strength of this dependence grows with the learners risk-sensitivity $|\beta|$. We also provide two lower bounds which shows that exponential dependence on $|\beta|\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ is unavoidable in both cases. The lower bounds reveal that the PAC-bounds are both tight in $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ and that the PAC-bound on $Q$-learning is tight in the number of actions $A$, and that the PAC-bound on policy-learning is nearly tight in $A$.

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning with large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, demonstrates impressive capabilities in domains like mathematics and coding, by exhibiting complex cognitive behaviors such as verification, goal decomposition, and self-reflection. However, it is unclear what behavior is effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. In this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning (DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on OSWorld, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that 1) using critique generation for world model training is effective to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agents with better performance correlate with better world modeling abilities. We believe our results suggest a promising research direction to integrate world model simulation into AI agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities.

Abstract: Consensus is a popular technique for distributed state estimation. This formulation allows networks of connected agents or sensors to exchange information about the distribution of a set of targets with their immediate neighbors without the need of a centralized node or layer. We present decentralized consensus-based fusion techniques for a system whose target prior estimates are a weighted mixture of Gaussian probability density functions (PDFs) for the following cases: 1) in which all agents have the same a priori Gaussian mixture estimate of the target, and 2) in which agents have different a priori Gaussian mixture estimates of the target. For the second case, we present a formulation that fuses each agent's a priori estimate without using local observations such that each agent's posterior estimate is the same across the network.

<title>LoHoVLA: A Unified Vision-Language-Action Model for Long-Horizon Embodied Tasks</title>

Abstract: Real-world embodied agents face long-horizon tasks, characterized by high-level goals demanding multi-step solutions beyond single actions. Successfully navigating these requires both high-level task planning (i.e., decomposing goals into sub-tasks) and low-level motion control (i.e., generating precise robot actions). While existing vision language action (VLA) models and hierarchical architectures offer potential in embodied tasks, the former often falter in planning, and the latter can suffer from coordination issues, both hampering performance. We introduce a new unified VLA framework for long-horizon tasks, dubbed LoHoVLA, to overcome these limitations. LoHoVLA leverages a large pretrained vision language model (VLM) as the backbone to jointly generate language and action tokens for sub-task generation and robot action prediction, respectively. This shared representation promotes better generalization across tasks. Additionally, LoHoVLA embraces a hierarchical closed-loop control mechanism to mitigate errors originating from both high-level planning and low-level control. To train LoHoVLA, we introduce LoHoSet, a dataset built on the Ravens simulator, containing 20 long-horizon tasks, each with 1,000 expert demonstrations composed of visual observations, linguistic goals, sub-tasks, and robot actions. Experimental results show that LoHoVLA significantly surpasses both hierarchical and standard VLA approaches on long-horizon embodied tasks in the Ravens simulator. These findings underscore the promise of unified architectures for advancing generalizable embodied intelligence.

Abstract: World models are emerging as a transformative paradigm in artificial intelligence, enabling agents to construct internal representations of their environments for predictive reasoning, planning, and decision-making. By learning latent dynamics, world models provide a sample-efficient framework that is especially valuable in data-constrained or safety-critical scenarios. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of world models, highlighting their architecture, training paradigms, and applications across prediction, generation, planning, and causal reasoning. We compare and distinguish world models from related concepts such as digital twins, the metaverse, and foundation models, clarifying their unique role as embedded cognitive engines for autonomous agents. We further propose Wireless Dreamer, a novel world model-based reinforcement learning framework tailored for wireless edge intelligence optimization, particularly in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs). Through a weather-aware UAV trajectory planning case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving learning efficiency and decision quality.

<title>Enabling Chatbots with Eyes and Ears: An Immersive Multimodal Conversation System for Dynamic Interactions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00421</link>

Abstract: As chatbots continue to evolve toward human-like, real-world, interactions, multimodality remains an active area of research and exploration. So far, efforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on image-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions, placing emphasis on the "eyes" of human perception while neglecting the "ears", namely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static interactions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally incorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of simultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been explored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific constraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural conversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots with "eyes and ears" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As part of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset, Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), and propose a novel multimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval. Our model, trained on the $M^3C$, demonstrates the ability to seamlessly engage in long-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex, real-world-like settings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs to understand and respond appropriately. Human evaluations highlight the model's strong performance in maintaining coherent and dynamic interactions, demonstrating its potential for advanced multimodal conversational agents.

Abstract: Ensembling large language models (LLMs) can effectively combine diverse strengths of different models, offering a promising approach to enhance performance across various tasks. However, existing methods typically rely on fixed weighting strategies that fail to adapt to the dynamic, context-dependent characteristics of LLM capabilities. In this work, we propose Reinforcement Learning-Assisted Ensemble for LLMs (RLAE), a novel framework that reformulates LLM ensemble through the lens of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our approach introduces a RL agent that dynamically adjusts ensemble weights by considering both input context and intermediate generation states, with the agent being trained using rewards that directly correspond to the quality of final outputs. We implement RLAE using both single-agent and multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms ($\text{RLAE}_\text{PPO}$ and $\text{RLAE}_\text{MAPPO}$ ), demonstrating substantial improvements over conventional ensemble methods. Extensive evaluations on a diverse set of tasks show that RLAE outperforms existing approaches by up to $3.3\%$ accuracy points, offering a more effective framework for LLM ensembling. Furthermore, our method exhibits superior generalization capabilities across different tasks without the need for retraining, while simultaneously achieving lower time latency.

Abstract: Hanabi has become a popular game for research when it comes to reinforcement learning (RL) as it is one of the few cooperative card games where you have incomplete knowledge of the entire environment, thus presenting a challenge for a RL agent. We explored different tabular and deep reinforcement learning algorithms to see which had the best performance both against an agent of the same type and also against other types of agents. We establish that certain agents played their highest scoring games against specific agents while others exhibited higher scores on average by adapting to the opposing agent's behavior. We attempted to quantify the conditions under which each algorithm provides the best advantage and identified the most interesting interactions between agents of different types. In the end, we found that temporal difference (TD) algorithms had better overall performance and balancing of play types compared to tabular agents. Specifically, tabular Expected SARSA and deep Q-Learning agents showed the best performance.

<title>Temac: Multi-Agent Collaboration for Automated Web GUI Testing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00520</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality assurance of web applications is critical, as web applications play an essential role in people's daily lives. To reduce labor costs, automated web GUI testing (AWGT) is widely adopted, exploring web applications via GUI actions such as clicks and text inputs. However, these approaches face limitations in generating continuous and meaningful action sequences capable of covering complex functionalities. Recent work incorporates large language models (LLMs) for GUI testing. However, these approaches face various challenges, including low efficiency of LLMs, high complexity of rich web application contexts, and a low success rate of LLMs in executing GUI tasks.
  To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose Temac, an approach that enhances AWGT using LLM-based multi-agent collaboration to increase code coverage. Temac is motivated by our insight that LLMs can enhance AWGT in executing complex functionalities, while the information discovered during AWGT can, in turn, be provided as the domain knowledge to improve the LLM-based task execution. Specifically, given a web application, Temac initially runs an existing approach to broadly explore application states. When the testing coverage stagnates, Temac then employs LLM-based agents to summarize the collected information to form a knowledge base and to infer not-covered functionalities. Guided by this knowledge base, Temac finally uses specialized LLM-based agents to target and execute the not-covered functionalities, reaching deeper states beyond those explored by the existing approach.
  Our evaluation results show that Temac exceeds state-of-the-art approaches from 12.5% to 60.3% on average code coverage on six complex open-source web applications, while revealing 445 unique failures in the top 20 real-world web applications. These results strongly demonstrate the effectiveness and the general applicability of Temac.

<title>ARIA: Training Language Agents with Intention-Driven Reward Aggregation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00539</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to perform complex reasoning and decision-making through free-form language interactions. However, in open-ended language action environments (e.g., negotiation or question-asking games), the action space can be formulated as a joint distribution over tokens, resulting in an exponentially large action space. Sampling actions in such a space can lead to extreme reward sparsity, which brings large reward variance, hindering effective reinforcement learning (RL). To address this, we propose ARIA, a method that Aggregates Rewards in Intention space to enable efficient and effective language Agents training. ARIA aims to project natural language actions from the high-dimensional joint token distribution space into a low-dimensional intention space, where semantically similar actions are clustered and assigned shared rewards. This intention-aware reward aggregation reduces reward variance by densifying reward signals, fostering better policy optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARIA not only significantly reduces policy gradient variance, but also delivers substantial performance gains of an average of 9.95% across four downstream tasks, consistently outperforming offline and online RL baselines.

Abstract: Lightweight long-range mapping is critical for safe navigation of UAV swarms in large-scale unknown environments. Traditional stereo vision systems with fixed short baselines face limited perception ranges. To address this, we propose Flying Co-Stereo, a cross-agent collaborative stereo vision system that leverages the wide-baseline spatial configuration of two UAVs for long-range dense mapping. Key innovations include: (1) a dual-spectrum visual-inertial-ranging estimator for robust baseline estimation; (2) a hybrid feature association strategy combining deep learning-based cross-agent matching and optical-flow-based intra-agent tracking; (3) A sparse-to-dense depth recovery scheme,refining dense monocular depth predictions using exponential fitting of long-range triangulated sparse landmarks for precise metric-scale mapping. Experiments demonstrate the Flying Co-Stereo system achieves dense 3D mapping up to 70 meters with 2.3%-9.7% relative error, outperforming conventional systems by up to 350% in depth range and 450% in coverage area.

Abstract: Evaluation frameworks for text summarization have evolved in terms of both domain coverage and metrics. However, existing benchmarks still lack domain-specific assessment criteria, remain predominantly English-centric, and face challenges with human annotation due to the complexity of reasoning. To address these, we introduce MSumBench, which provides a multi-dimensional, multi-domain evaluation of summarization in English and Chinese. It also incorporates specialized assessment criteria for each domain and leverages a multi-agent debate system to enhance annotation quality. By evaluating eight modern summarization models, we discover distinct performance patterns across domains and languages. We further examine large language models as summary evaluators, analyzing the correlation between their evaluation and summarization capabilities, and uncovering systematic bias in their assessment of self-generated summaries. Our benchmark dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/MSumBench.

Abstract: Constrained by the cost and ethical concerns of involving real seekers in AI-driven mental health, researchers develop LLM-based conversational agents (CAs) with tailored configurations, such as profiles, symptoms, and scenarios, to simulate seekers. While these efforts advance AI in mental health, achieving more realistic seeker simulation remains hindered by two key challenges: dynamic evolution and multi-session memory. Seekers' mental states often fluctuate during counseling, which typically spans multiple sessions. To address this, we propose AnnaAgent, an emotional and cognitive dynamic agent system equipped with tertiary memory. AnnaAgent incorporates an emotion modulator and a complaint elicitor trained on real counseling dialogues, enabling dynamic control of the simulator's configurations. Additionally, its tertiary memory mechanism effectively integrates short-term and long-term memory across sessions. Evaluation results, both automated and manual, demonstrate that AnnaAgent achieves more realistic seeker simulation in psychological counseling compared to existing baselines. The ethically reviewed and screened code can be found on https://github.com/sci-m-wang/AnnaAgent.

Abstract: The Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm is an elegant procedure for finding a stable matching in two-sided matching markets. It ensures that no pair of agents prefers each other to their matched partners. In this work, we initiate the study of two-sided manipulations in matching markets as non-cooperative games. We introduce the accomplice manipulation game, where a man misreports to help a specific woman obtain a better partner, whenever possible. We provide a polynomial time algorithm for finding a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) and show that our algorithm always yields a stable matching - although not every Nash equilibrium corresponds to a stable matching. Additionally, we show how our analytical techniques for the accomplice manipulation game can be applied to other manipulation games in matching markets, such as one-for-many and the standard self-manipulation games. We complement our theoretical findings with empirical evaluations of different properties of the resulting NE, such as the welfare of the agents.

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 18.4% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.

arXiv:2506.00574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern wireless networks must adapt to dynamic conditions while efficiently managing diverse service demands. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) struggles in these environments, as scattered and evolving feedback makes optimal decision-making challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a solution by structuring unorganized network feedback into meaningful latent representations, helping RL agents recognize patterns more effectively. For example, in O-RAN slicing, concepts like SNR, power levels and throughput are semantically related, and LLMs can naturally cluster them, providing a more interpretable state representation. To leverage this capability, we introduce a contextualization-based adaptation method that integrates learnable prompts into an LLM-augmented DRL framework. Instead of relying on full model fine-tuning, we refine state representations through task-specific prompts that dynamically adjust to network conditions. Utilizing ORANSight, an LLM trained on O-RAN knowledge, we develop Prompt-Augmented Multi agent RL (PA-MRL) framework. Learnable prompts optimize both semantic clustering and RL objectives, allowing RL agents to achieve higher rewards in fewer iterations and adapt more efficiently. By incorporating prompt-augmented learning, our approach enables faster, more scalable, and adaptive resource allocation in O-RAN slicing. Experimental results show that it accelerates convergence and outperforms other baselines.

arXiv:2506.00576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced wireless networks must support highly dynamic and heterogeneous service demands. Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables this flexibility by adopting modular, disaggregated components, such as the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), Centralized Unit (CU), and Distributed Unit (DU), that can support intelligent control via machine learning (ML). While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful tool for managing dynamic resource allocation and slicing, it often struggles to process raw, unstructured input like RF features, QoS metrics, and traffic trends. These limitations hinder policy generalization and decision efficiency in partially observable and evolving environments. To address this, we propose \textit{ORAN-GUIDE}, a dual-LLM framework that enhances multi-agent RL (MARL) with task-relevant, semantically enriched state representations. The architecture employs a domain-specific language model, ORANSight, pretrained on O-RAN control and configuration data, to generate structured, context-aware prompts. These prompts are fused with learnable tokens and passed to a frozen GPT-based encoder that outputs high-level semantic representations for DRL agents. This design adopts a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style pipeline tailored for technical decision-making in wireless systems. Experimental results show that ORAN-GUIDE improves sample efficiency, policy convergence, and performance generalization over standard MARL and single-LLM baselines.

Abstract: Directly training Large Language Models (LLMs) for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) remains challenging due to intricate reward modeling, dynamic agent interactions, and demanding generalization requirements. This paper explores whether post-training techniques, specifically Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), can effectively $\textit{generalize}$ to multi-agent scenarios. We use economic reasoning as a testbed, leveraging its strong foundations in mathematics and game theory, its demand for structured analytical reasoning, and its relevance to real-world applications such as market design, resource allocation, and policy analysis. We introduce $\textbf{Recon}$ ($\textbf{R}$easoning like an $\textbf{ECON}$omist), a 7B-parameter open-source LLM post-trained on a hand-curated dataset of 2,100 high-quality economic reasoning problems. Comprehensive evaluation on economic reasoning benchmarks and multi-agent games reveals clear improvements in structured reasoning and economic rationality. These results underscore the promise of domain-aligned post-training for enhancing reasoning and agent alignment, shedding light on the roles of SFT and RL in shaping model behavior.

Abstract: Plasticity, or the ability of an agent to adapt to new tasks, environments, or distributions, is crucial for continual learning. In this paper, we study the loss of plasticity in deep continual RL from the lens of churn: network output variability for out-of-batch data induced by mini-batch training. We demonstrate that (1) the loss of plasticity is accompanied by the exacerbation of churn due to the gradual rank decrease of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) matrix; (2) reducing churn helps prevent rank collapse and adjusts the step size of regular RL gradients adaptively. Moreover, we introduce Continual Churn Approximated Reduction (C-CHAIN) and demonstrate it improves learning performance and outperforms baselines in a diverse range of continual learning environments on OpenAI Gym Control, ProcGen, DeepMind Control Suite, and MinAtar benchmarks.

arXiv:2506.00608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contract review is a complex and time-intensive task that typically demands specialized legal expertise, rendering it largely inaccessible to non-experts. Moreover, legal interpretation is rarely straightforward-ambiguity is pervasive, and judgments often hinge on subjective assessments. Compounding these challenges, contracts are usually confidential, restricting their use with proprietary models and necessitating reliance on open-source alternatives. To address these challenges, we introduce PAKTON: a fully open-source, end-to-end, multi-agent framework with plug-and-play capabilities. PAKTON is designed to handle the complexities of contract analysis through collaborative agent workflows and a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) component, enabling automated legal document review that is more accessible, adaptable, and privacy-preserving. Experiments demonstrate that PAKTON outperforms both general-purpose and pretrained models in predictive accuracy, retrieval performance, explainability, completeness, and grounded justifications as evaluated through a human study and validated with automated metrics.

Abstract: With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they are increasingly deployed as autonomous computer-use agents capable of accomplishing complex computer tasks. However, a pressing issue arises: Can the safety risk principles designed and aligned for general MLLMs in dialogue scenarios be effectively transferred to real-world computer-use scenarios? Existing research on evaluating the safety risks of MLLM-based computer-use agents suffers from several limitations: it either lacks realistic interactive environments, or narrowly focuses on one or a few specific risk types. These limitations ignore the complexity, variability, and diversity of real-world environments, thereby restricting comprehensive risk evaluation for computer-use agents. To this end, we introduce \textbf{RiOSWorld}, a benchmark designed to evaluate the potential risks of MLLM-based agents during real-world computer manipulations. Our benchmark includes 492 risky tasks spanning various computer applications, involving web, social media, multimedia, os, email, and office software. We categorize these risks into two major classes based on their risk source: (i) User-originated risks and (ii) Environmental risks. For the evaluation, we evaluate safety risks from two perspectives: (i) Risk goal intention and (ii) Risk goal completion. Extensive experiments with multimodal agents on \textbf{RiOSWorld} demonstrate that current computer-use agents confront significant safety risks in real-world scenarios. Our findings highlight the necessity and urgency of safety alignment for computer-use agents in real-world computer manipulation, providing valuable insights for developing trustworthy computer-use agents. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://yjyddq.github.io/RiOSWorld.github.io/.

<title>The Disparate Effects of Partial Information in Bayesian Strategic Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We study how partial information about scoring rules affects fairness in strategic learning settings. In strategic learning, a learner deploys a scoring rule, and agents respond strategically by modifying their features -- at some cost -- to improve their outcomes. However, in our work, agents do not observe the scoring rule directly; instead, they receive a noisy signal of said rule. We consider two different agent models: (i) naive agents, who take the noisy signal at face value, and (ii) Bayesian agents, who update a prior belief based on the signal.
  Our goal is to understand how disparities in outcomes arise between groups that differ in their costs of feature modification, and how these disparities vary with the level of transparency of the learner's rule. For naive agents, we show that utility disparities can grow unboundedly with noise, and that the group with lower costs can, perhaps counter-intuitively, be disproportionately harmed under limited transparency. In contrast, for Bayesian agents, disparities remain bounded. We provide a full characterization of disparities across groups as a function of the level of transparency and show that they can vary non-monotonically with noise; in particular, disparities are often minimized at intermediate levels of transparency. Finally, we extend our analysis to settings where groups differ not only in cost, but also in prior beliefs, and study how this asymmetry influences fairness.

<title>Social Construction of Urban Space: Understanding Neighborhood Boundaries Using Rental Listings</title>

Abstract: Rental listings offer a unique window into how urban space is socially constructed through language. We analyze Chicago Craigslist rental advertisements from 2018 to 2024 to examine how listing agents characterize neighborhoods, identifying mismatches between institutional boundaries and neighborhood claims. Through manual and large language model annotation, we classify unstructured listings from Craigslist according to their neighborhood. Geospatial analysis reveals three distinct patterns: properties with conflicting neighborhood designations due to competing spatial definitions, border properties with valid claims to adjacent neighborhoods, and ``reputation laundering" where listings claim association with distant, desirable neighborhoods. Through topic modeling, we identify patterns that correlate with spatial positioning: listings further from neighborhood centers emphasize different amenities than centrally-located units. Our findings demonstrate that natural language processing techniques can reveal how definitions of urban spaces are contested in ways that traditional methods overlook.

<title>AgentAuditor: Human-Level Safety and Security Evaluation for LLM Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00641</link>

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of LLM-based agents, the reliable evaluation of their safety and security remains a significant challenge. Existing rule-based or LLM-based evaluators often miss dangers in agents' step-by-step actions, overlook subtle meanings, fail to see how small issues compound, and get confused by unclear safety or security rules. To overcome this evaluation crisis, we introduce \sys, a universal, training-free, memory-augmented reasoning framework that empowers LLM evaluators to emulate human expert evaluators. \sys constructs an experiential memory by having an LLM adaptively extract structured semantic features (e.g., scenario, risk, behavior) and generate associated chain-of-thought reasoning traces for past interactions. A multi-stage, context-aware retrieval-augmented generation process then dynamically retrieves the most relevant reasoning experiences to guide the LLM evaluator's assessment of new cases. Moreover, we developed \data, the first benchmark designed to check how well LLM-based evaluators can spot both safety risks and security threats. \data comprises \textbf{2293} meticulously annotated interaction records, covering \textbf{15} risk types across \textbf{29} application scenarios. A key feature of \data is its nuanced approach to ambiguous risk situations, employing ``Strict'' and ``Lenient'' judgment standards. Experiments demonstrate that \sys not only consistently improves the evaluation performance of LLMs across all benchmarks but also sets a new state-of-the-art in LLM-as-a-judge for agent safety and security, achieving human-level accuracy. Our work is openly openly accessible.

<title>Optimizing Sensory Neurons: Nonlinear Attention Mechanisms for Accelerated Convergence in Permutation-Invariant Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00691</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents often requires significant computational resources and extended training times. To address this, we build upon the foundation laid by Google Brain's Sensory Neuron, which introduced a novel neural architecture for reinforcement learning tasks that maintained permutation in-variance in the sensory neuron system. While the baseline model demonstrated significant performance improvements over traditional approaches, we identified opportunities to enhance the efficiency of the learning process further. We propose a modified attention mechanism incorporating a non-linear transformation of the key vectors (K) using a mapping function, resulting in a new set of key vectors (K'). This non-linear mapping enhances the representational capacity of the attention mechanism, allowing the model to encode more complex feature interactions and accelerating convergence without compromising performance. Our enhanced model demonstrates significant improvements in learning efficiency, showcasing the potential for non-linear attention mechanisms in advancing reinforcement learning algorithms.

<title>Adaptive Traffic-Following Scheme for Orderly Distributed Control of Multi-Vehicle Systems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00703</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an adaptive control scheme to enable the emergence of order within distributed, autonomous multi-agent systems. Past studies showed that under high-density conditions, order generated from traffic-following behavior reduces travel times, while under low densities, choosing direct paths is more beneficial. In this paper, we leveraged those findings to allow aircraft to independently and dynamically adjust their degree of traffic-following behavior based on the current state of the airspace. This enables aircraft to follow other traffic only when beneficial. Quantitative analyses revealed that dynamic traffic-following behavior results in lower aircraft travel times at the cost of minimal levels of additional disorder to the airspace. The sensitivity of these benefits to temporal and spatial horizons was also investigated. Overall, this work highlights the benefits, and potential necessity, of incorporating self-organizing behavior in making distributed, autonomous multi-agent systems scalable.

<title>An LLM Agent for Functional Bug Detection in Network Protocols</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00714</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional correctness is critical for ensuring the reliability and security of network protocol implementations. Functional bugs, instances where implementations diverge from behaviors specified in RFC documents, can lead to severe consequences, including faulty routing, authentication bypasses, and service disruptions. Detecting these bugs requires deep semantic analysis across specification documents and source code, a task beyond the capabilities of traditional static analysis tools. This paper introduces RFCScan, an autonomous agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect functional bugs by checking conformance between network protocol implementations and their RFC specifications. Inspired by the human auditing procedure, RFCScan comprises two key components: an indexing agent and a detection agent. The former hierarchically summarizes protocol code semantics, generating semantic indexes that enable the detection agent to narrow down the scanning scope. The latter employs demand-driven retrieval to iteratively collect additional relevant data structures and functions, eventually identifying potential inconsistencies with the RFC specifications effectively. We evaluate RFCScan across six real-world network protocol implementations. RFCScan identifies 47 functional bugs with 81.9% precision, of which 20 bugs have been confirmed or fixed by developers.

<title>Adaptive Plane Reformatting for 4D Flow MRI using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have shown robust results in plane reformatting tasks. In these methods, an agent sequentially adjusts the position and orientation of an initial plane towards an objective location. This process allows accurate plane reformatting, without the need for detailed landmarks, which makes it suitable for images with limited contrast and resolution, such as 4D flow MRI. However, current DRL methods require the test dataset to be in the same position and orientation as the training dataset. In this paper, we present a novel technique that utilizes a flexible coordinate system based on the current state, enabling navigation in volumes at any position or orientation. We adopted the Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) algorithm for reinforcement learning, outperforming Deep Q Network (DQN). Experimental results in 4D flow MRI demonstrate improved accuracy in plane reformatting angular and distance errors (6.32 +- 4.15 {\deg} and 3.40 +- 2.75 mm), as well as statistically equivalent flow measurements determined by a plane reformatting process done by an expert (p=0.21). The method's flexibility and adaptability make it a promising candidate for other medical imaging applications beyond 4D flow MRI.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown impressive capabilities in human language comprehension and reasoning, yet their potential in cybersecurity remains underexplored. We introduce DefenderBench, a practical, open-source toolkit for evaluating language agents across offense, defense, and cybersecurity knowledge-based tasks. DefenderBench includes environments for network intrusion, malicious content detection, code vulnerability analysis, and cybersecurity knowledge assessment. It is intentionally designed to be affordable and easily accessible for researchers while providing fair and rigorous assessment. We benchmark several state-of-the-art (SoTA) and popular LLMs, including both open- and closed-weight models, using a standardized agentic framework. Our results show that Claude-3.7-sonnet performs best with a DefenderBench score of 81.65, followed by Claude-3.7-sonnet-think with 78.40, while the best open-weight model, Llama 3.3 70B, is not far behind with a DefenderBench score of 71.81. DefenderBench's modular design allows seamless integration of custom LLMs and tasks, promoting reproducibility and fair comparisons. An anonymized version of DefenderBench is available at https://github.com/microsoft/DefenderBench.

<title>Alignment Revisited: Are Large Language Models Consistent in Stated and Revealed Preferences?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00751</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need to align their behaviors with human values. A critical, yet understudied, issue is the potential divergence between an LLM's stated preferences (its reported alignment with general principles) and its revealed preferences (inferred from decisions in contextualized scenarios). Such deviations raise fundamental concerns for the interpretability, trustworthiness, reasoning transparency, and ethical deployment of LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications. This work formally defines and proposes a method to measure this preference deviation. We investigate how LLMs may activate different guiding principles in specific contexts, leading to choices that diverge from previously stated general principles. Our approach involves crafting a rich dataset of well-designed prompts as a series of forced binary choices and presenting them to LLMs. We compare LLM responses to general principle prompts stated preference with LLM responses to contextualized prompts revealed preference, using metrics like KL divergence to quantify the deviation. We repeat the analysis across different categories of preferences and on four mainstream LLMs and find that a minor change in prompt format can often pivot the preferred choice regardless of the preference categories and LLMs in the test. This prevalent phenomenon highlights the lack of understanding and control of the LLM decision-making competence. Our study will be crucial for integrating LLMs into services, especially those that interact directly with humans, where morality, fairness, and social responsibilities are crucial dimensions. Furthermore, identifying or being aware of such deviation will be critically important as LLMs are increasingly envisioned for autonomous agentic tasks where continuous human evaluation of all LLMs' intermediary decision-making steps is impossible.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred transformative applications in various domains, ranging from open-source to proprietary LLMs. However, jailbreak attacks, which aim to break safety alignment and user compliance by tricking the target LLMs into answering harmful and risky responses, are becoming an urgent concern. The practice of red-teaming for LLMs is to proactively explore potential risks and error-prone instances before the release of frontier AI technology. This paper proposes an agentic workflow to automate and scale the red-teaming process of LLMs through the Composition-of-Principles (CoP) framework, where human users provide a set of red-teaming principles as instructions to an AI agent to automatically orchestrate effective red-teaming strategies and generate jailbreak prompts. Distinct from existing red-teaming methods, our CoP framework provides a unified and extensible framework to encompass and orchestrate human-provided red-teaming principles to enable the automated discovery of new red-teaming strategies. When tested against leading LLMs, CoP reveals unprecedented safety risks by finding novel jailbreak prompts and improving the best-known single-turn attack success rate by up to 19.0 times.

Abstract: Drama-in-education is an interdisciplinary instructional approach that integrates subjects such as language, history, and psychology. Its core component is playwriting. Based on need-finding interviews of 13 teachers, we found that current general-purpose AI tools cannot effectively assist teachers and students during playwriting. Therefore, we propose CO-OPERA - a collaborative playwriting tool integrating generative artificial intelligence capabilities. In CO-OPERA, users can both expand their thinking through discussions with a tutor and converge their thinking by operating agents to generate script elements. Additionally, the system allows for iterative modifications and regenerations based on user requirements. A system usability test conducted with middle school students shows that our CO-OPERA helps users focus on whole logical narrative development during playwriting. Our playwriting examples and raw data for qualitative and quantitative analysis are available at https://github.com/daisyinb612/CO-OPERA.

Abstract: Many promising-looking ideas in AI research fail to deliver, but their validation takes substantial human labor and compute. Predicting an idea's chance of success is thus crucial for accelerating empirical AI research, a skill that even expert researchers can only acquire through substantial experience. We build the first benchmark for this task and compare LMs with human experts. Concretely, given two research ideas (e.g., two jailbreaking methods), we aim to predict which will perform better on a set of benchmarks. We scrape ideas and experimental results from conference papers, yielding 1,585 human-verified idea pairs published after our base model's cut-off date for testing, and 6,000 pairs for training. We then develop a system that combines a fine-tuned GPT-4.1 with a paper retrieval agent, and we recruit 25 human experts to compare with. In the NLP domain, our system beats human experts by a large margin (64.4% v.s. 48.9%). On the full test set, our system achieves 77% accuracy, while off-the-shelf frontier LMs like o3 perform no better than random guessing, even with the same retrieval augmentation. We verify that our system does not exploit superficial features like idea complexity through extensive human-written and LM-designed robustness tests. Finally, we evaluate our system on unpublished novel ideas, including ideas generated by an AI ideation agent. Our system achieves 63.6% accuracy, demonstrating its potential as a reward model for improving idea generation models. Altogether, our results outline a promising new direction for LMs to accelerate empirical AI research.

<title>Action Dependency Graphs for Globally Optimal Coordinated Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Action-dependent individual policies, which incorporate both environmental states and the actions of other agents in decision-making, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving global optimality in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, the existing literature often adopts auto-regressive action-dependent policies, where each agent's policy depends on the actions of all preceding agents. This formulation incurs substantial computational complexity as the number of agents increases, thereby limiting scalability. In this work, we consider a more generalized class of action-dependent policies, which do not necessarily follow the auto-regressive form. We propose to use the `action dependency graph (ADG)' to model the inter-agent action dependencies. Within the context of MARL problems structured by coordination graphs, we prove that an action-dependent policy with a sparse ADG can achieve global optimality, provided the ADG satisfies specific conditions specified by the coordination graph. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop a tabular policy iteration algorithm with guaranteed global optimality. Furthermore, we integrate our framework into several SOTA algorithms and conduct experiments in complex environments. The empirical results affirm the robustness and applicability of our approach in more general scenarios, underscoring its potential for broader MARL challenges.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Industry 4.0 has led to the emergence of smart factories, where multirobot system autonomously operates to enhance productivity, reduce operational costs, and improve system adaptability. However, maintaining reliable and efficient network operations in these dynamic and complex environments requires advanced automation mechanisms. This study presents a zero-touch network platform that integrates a hierarchical Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, enabling the seamless incorporation of advanced machine learning algorithms and dynamic management of communication and computational resources, while ensuring uninterrupted connectivity with multirobot system. Leveraging this adaptability, the platform utilizes federated deep reinforcement learning (FedDRL) to enable distributed decision-making across multiple learning agents, facilitating the adaptive parameter reconfiguration of transmitters (i.e., multirobot system) to optimize long-term system throughput and transmission energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that within the proposed O-RAN-enabled zero-touch network platform, FedDRL achieves a 12% increase in system throughput, a 32% improvement in normalized average transmission energy efficiency, and a 28% reduction in average transmission energy consumption compared to baseline methods such as independent DRL.

Abstract: Generating natural-sounding, multi-speaker dialogue is crucial for applications such as podcast creation, virtual agents, and multimedia content generation. However, existing systems struggle to maintain speaker consistency, model overlapping speech, and synthesize coherent conversations efficiently. In this paper, we introduce CoVoMix2, a fully non-autoregressive framework for zero-shot multi-talker dialogue generation. CoVoMix2 directly predicts mel-spectrograms from multi-stream transcriptions using a flow-matching-based generative model, eliminating the reliance on intermediate token representations. To better capture realistic conversational dynamics, we propose transcription-level speaker disentanglement, sentence-level alignment, and prompt-level random masking strategies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines like MoonCast and Sesame in speech quality, speaker consistency, and inference speed. Notably, CoVoMix2 operates without requiring transcriptions for the prompt and supports controllable dialogue generation, including overlapping speech and precise timing control, demonstrating strong generalizability to real-world speech generation scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into increasingly autonomous agents, fundamental questions about their epistemic foundations remain unresolved: What defines an agent? How should it make decisions? And what objectives should guide its behavior? In this position paper, we argue that true autonomy requires agents to be grounded in a coherent epistemic framework that governs what they know, what they need to know, and how to acquire that knowledge efficiently. We propose a unified theory that treats internal reasoning and external actions as equivalent epistemic tools, enabling agents to systematically coordinate introspection and interaction. Building on this framework, we advocate for aligning an agent's tool use decision-making boundary with its knowledge boundary, thereby minimizing unnecessary tool use and maximizing epistemic efficiency. This perspective shifts the design of agents from mere action executors to knowledge-driven intelligence systems, offering a principled path toward building foundation agents capable of adaptive, efficient, and goal-directed behavior.

arXiv:2506.00898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes an Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL)-based energy management method for a smart home, which incorporates an implicit thermal dynamics model. In the proposed method, historical optimal decisions are first generated using a neural network-assisted Hierarchical Model Predictive Control (HMPC) framework. These decisions are then used as expert demonstrations in the AIRL module, which aims to train a discriminator to distinguish expert demonstrations from transitions generated by a reinforcement learning agent policy, while simultaneously updating the agent policy that can produce transitions to confuse the discriminator. The proposed HMPC-AIRL method eliminates the need for explicit thermal dynamics models, prior or predictive knowledge of uncertain parameters, or manually designed reward functions. Simulation results based on real-world traces demonstrate the effectiveness and data efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: Deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been demonstrated effectively in simulations for many multi-robot problems. For autonomous vehicles, the development of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technologies provide opportunities to further enhance safety of the system. However, zero-shot transfer of simulator-trained MARL policies to hardware dynamic systems remains challenging, and how to leverage communication and shared information for MARL has limited demonstrations on hardware. This problem is challenged by discrepancies between simulated and physical states, system state and model uncertainties, practical shared information design, and the need for safety guarantees in both simulation and hardware. This paper introduces RSR-RSMARL, a novel Robust and Safe MARL framework that supports Real-Sim-Real (RSR) policy adaptation for multi-agent systems with communication among agents, with both simulation and hardware demonstrations. RSR-RSMARL leverages state (includes shared state information among agents) and action representations considering real system complexities for MARL formulation. The MARL policy is trained with robust MARL algorithm to enable zero-shot transfer to hardware considering the sim-to-real gap. A safety shield module using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provides safety guarantee for each individual agent. Experiment results on F1/10th-scale autonomous vehicles with V2V communication demonstrate the ability of RSR-RSMARL framework to enhance driving safety and coordination across multiple configurations. These findings emphasize the importance of jointly designing robust policy representations and modular safety architectures to enable scalable, generalizable RSR transfer in multi-agent autonomy.

<title>Simple Prompt Injection Attacks Can Leak Personal Data Observed by LLM Agents During Task Execution</title>

Abstract: Previous benchmarks on prompt injection in large language models (LLMs) have primarily focused on generic tasks and attacks, offering limited insights into more complex threats like data exfiltration. This paper examines how prompt injection can cause tool-calling agents to leak personal data observed during task execution. Using a fictitious banking agent, we develop data flow-based attacks and integrate them into AgentDojo, a recent benchmark for agentic security. To enhance its scope, we also create a richer synthetic dataset of human-AI banking conversations. In 16 user tasks from AgentDojo, LLMs show a 15-50 percentage point drop in utility under attack, with average attack success rates (ASR) around 20 percent; some defenses reduce ASR to zero. Most LLMs, even when successfully tricked by the attack, avoid leaking highly sensitive data like passwords, likely due to safety alignments, but they remain vulnerable to disclosing other personal data. The likelihood of password leakage increases when a password is requested along with one or two additional personal details. In an extended evaluation across 48 tasks, the average ASR is around 15 percent, with no built-in AgentDojo defense fully preventing leakage. Tasks involving data extraction or authorization workflows, which closely resemble the structure of exfiltration attacks, exhibit the highest ASRs, highlighting the interaction between task type, agent performance, and defense efficacy.

<title>MCP-Zero: Proactive Toolchain Construction for LLM Agents from Scratch</title>

arXiv:2506.01056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Function-calling has enabled large language models (LLMs) to act as tool-using agents, but injecting thousands of tool schemas into the prompt is costly and error-prone. We introduce MCP-Zero, a proactive agent framework that lets the LLM itself decide when and which external tools to retrieve, thereby assembling a task-specific toolchain from scratch. The framework is built upon three components: (1) Proactive Tool Request, where the model emits a structured $\left<\operatorname{tool\_assistant}\right>$ block that explicitly specifies the desired server and task; (2) Hierarchical Vector Routing, a coarse-to-fine retrieval algorithm that first selects candidate servers and then ranks tools within each server based on the semantic similarity; (3) Iterative Proactive Invocation, enabling multi-round, cross-domain toolchain construction with minimal context overhead, and allowing the model to iteratively revise its request when the returned tools are insufficient. To evaluate our approach we also compile MCP-tools, a retrieval dataset comprising 308 MCP servers and 2,797 tools extracted from the official Model-Context-Protocol repository and normalized into a unified JSON schema. Experiments show that MCP-Zero (i) effectively addresses the context overhead problem of existing methods and accurately selects the correct tool from a pool of nearly 3,000 candidates (248.1k tokens); (ii) reduces token consumption by 98\% on the APIbank while maintaining high accuracy; and (iii) supports multi-turn tool invocation with consistent accuracy across rounds. The code and dataset will be released soon.

Abstract: We introduce SealQA, a new challenge benchmark for evaluating SEarch-Augmented Language models on fact-seeking questions where web search yields conflicting, noisy, or unhelpful results. SealQA comes in three flavors: (1) Seal-0 (main) and (2) Seal-Hard, which assess factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities, with Seal-0 focusing on the most challenging questions where chat models (e.g., GPT-4.1) typically achieve near-zero accuracy; and (3) LongSeal, which extends SealQA to test long-context, multi-document reasoning in "needle-in-a-haystack" settings. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations in current models: Even frontier LLMs perform poorly across all SealQA flavors. On Seal-0, frontier agentic models equipped with tools like o3 and o4-mini achieve only 17.1% and 6.3% accuracy, respectively, at their best reasoning efforts. We find that advanced reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-671B and o3-mini are highly vulnerable to noisy search results. Notably, increasing test-time compute does not yield reliable gains across o3-mini, o4-mini, and o3, with performance often plateauing or even declining early. Additionally, while recent models are less affected by the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, they still fail to reliably identify relevant documents in LongSeal when faced with numerous distractors. To facilitate future work, we release SealQA at huggingface.co/datasets/vtllms/sealqa.

<title>The Coming Crisis of Multi-Agent Misalignment: AI Alignment Must Be a Dynamic and Social Process</title>

Abstract: This position paper states that AI Alignment in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) should be considered a dynamic and interaction-dependent process that heavily depends on the social environment where agents are deployed, either collaborative, cooperative, or competitive. While AI alignment with human values and preferences remains a core challenge, the growing prevalence of MAS in real-world applications introduces a new dynamic that reshapes how agents pursue goals and interact to accomplish various tasks. As agents engage with one another, they must coordinate to accomplish both individual and collective goals. However, this complex social organization may unintentionally misalign some or all of these agents with human values or user preferences. Drawing on social sciences, we analyze how social structure can deter or shatter group and individual values. Based on these analyses, we call on the AI community to treat human, preferential, and objective alignment as an interdependent concept, rather than isolated problems. Finally, we emphasize the urgent need for simulation environments, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks that allow researchers to assess alignment in these interactive multi-agent contexts before such dynamics grow too complex to control.

<title>Modular Speaker Architecture: A Framework for Sustaining Responsibility and Contextual Integrity in Multi-Agent AI Communication</title>

Abstract: Sustaining coherent, role-aware communication across multi-agent systems remains a foundational challenge in AI. Current frameworks often lack explicit mechanisms for speaker responsibility, leading to context drift, alignment instability, and degraded interpretability over time. We propose the Modular Speaker Architecture (MSA), a framework that decomposes speaker behavior into modular components for role tracking, responsibility continuity, and contextual coherence. Grounded in high-context human-AI dialogues, MSA includes three core modules: a Speaker Role Module, a Responsibility Chain Tracker, and a Contextual Integrity Validator. We evaluate MSA through annotated case studies and introduce structural metrics-pragmatic consistency, responsibility flow, and context stability-quantified via manual and automatic scoring and bootstrapped statistical analysis. Our results show that MSA reliably maintains interaction structure without reliance on affective signals or surface-level heuristics. We further implement a prototype configuration language (G-Code) and modular API to support MSA deployment in dynamic multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: World models serve as essential building blocks toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), enabling intelligent agents to predict future states and plan actions by simulating complex physical interactions. However, existing interactive models primarily predict visual observations, thereby neglecting crucial hidden states like geometric structures and spatial coherence. This leads to rapid error accumulation and temporal inconsistency. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepVerse, a novel 4D interactive world model explicitly incorporating geometric predictions from previous timesteps into current predictions conditioned on actions. Experiments demonstrate that by incorporating explicit geometric constraints, DeepVerse captures richer spatio-temporal relationships and underlying physical dynamics. This capability significantly reduces drift and enhances temporal consistency, enabling the model to reliably generate extended future sequences and achieve substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, visual realism, and scene rationality. Furthermore, our method provides an effective solution for geometry-aware memory retrieval, effectively preserving long-term spatial consistency. We validate the effectiveness of DeepVerse across diverse scenarios, establishing its capacity for high-fidelity, long-horizon predictions grounded in geometry-aware dynamics.

Abstract: Structured scene representations are a core component of embodied agents, helping to consolidate raw sensory streams into readable, modular, and searchable formats. Due to their high computational overhead, many approaches build such representations in advance of the task. However, when the task specifications change, such static approaches become inadequate as they may miss key objects, spatial relations, and details. We introduce GraphPad, a modifiable structured memory that an agent can tailor to the needs of the task through API calls. It comprises a mutable scene graph representing the environment, a navigation log indexing frame-by-frame content, and a scratchpad for task-specific notes. Together, GraphPad serves as a dynamic workspace that remains complete, current, and aligned with the agent's immediate understanding of the scene and its task. On the OpenEQA benchmark, GraphPad attains 55.3%, a +3.0% increase over an image-only baseline using the same vision-language model, while operating with five times fewer input frames. These results show that allowing online, language-driven refinement of 3-D memory yields more informative representations without extra training or data collection.

Abstract: We study resource allocation in two-sided markets from a fundamental perspective and introduce a general modeling and algorithmic framework to effectively incorporate the complex and multidimensional aspects of fairness. Our main technical contribution is to show the existence of a range of near-feasible resource allocations parameterized in different model primitives to give flexibility when balancing the different policymaking requirements, allowing policy designers to fix these values according to the specific application. To construct our near-feasible allocations, we start from a fractional resource allocation and perform an iterative rounding procedure to get an integer allocation. We show a simple yet flexible and strong sufficient condition for the target feasibility deviations to guarantee that the rounding procedure succeeds, exhibiting the underlying trade-offs between market capacities, agents' demand, and fairness. To showcase our framework's modeling and algorithmic capabilities, we consider three prominent market design problems: school allocation, stable matching with couples, and political apportionment. In each of them, we obtain strengthened guarantees on the existence of near-feasible allocations capturing the corresponding fairness notions, such as proportionality, envy-freeness, and stability.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle (AV) planners must undergo rigorous evaluation before widespread deployment on public roads, particularly to assess their robustness against the uncertainty of human behaviors. While recent advancements in data-driven scenario generation enable the simulation of realistic human behaviors in interactive settings, leveraging these models to construct comprehensive tests for AV planners remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce an automated method to efficiently generate realistic and safety-critical human behaviors for AV planner evaluation in interactive scenarios. We parameterize complex human behaviors using low-dimensional goal positions, which are then fed into a promptable traffic simulator, ProSim, to guide the behaviors of simulated agents. To automate test generation, we introduce a prompt generation module that explores the goal domain and efficiently identifies safety-critical behaviors using Bayesian optimization. We apply our method to the evaluation of an optimization-based planner and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in automatically generating diverse and realistic driving behaviors across scenarios with varying initial conditions.

<title>Comprehensive Vulnerability Analysis is Necessary for Trustworthy LLM-MAS</title>

Abstract: This paper argues that a comprehensive vulnerability analysis is essential for building trustworthy Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS). These systems, which consist of multiple LLM-powered agents working collaboratively, are increasingly deployed in high-stakes applications but face novel security threats due to their complex structures. While single-agent vulnerabilities are well-studied, LLM-MAS introduces unique attack surfaces through inter-agent communication, trust relationships, and tool integration that remain significantly underexplored. We present a systematic framework for vulnerability analysis of LLM-MAS that unifies diverse research. For each type of vulnerability, we define formal threat models grounded in practical attacker capabilities and illustrate them using real-world LLM-MAS applications. This formulation enables rigorous quantification of vulnerability across different architectures and provides a foundation for designing meaningful evaluation benchmarks. Our analysis reveals that LLM-MAS faces elevated risk due to compositional effects -- vulnerabilities in individual components can cascade through agent communication, creating threat models not present in single-agent systems. We conclude by identifying critical open challenges: (1) developing benchmarks specifically tailored to LLM-MAS vulnerability assessment, (2) considering new potential attacks specific to multi-agent architectures, and (3) implementing trust management systems that can enforce security in LLM-MAS. This research provides essential groundwork for future efforts to enhance LLM-MAS trustworthiness as these systems continue their expansion into critical applications.

Abstract: CleanS2S is a framework for human-like speech-to-speech interaction that advances conversational AI through single-file implementation and proactive dialogue capabilities. Our system integrates automatic speech recognition, large language models, and text-to-speech synthesis into a unified pipeline with real-time interruption handling, achieving low transition latency through full-duplex websocket connections and non-blocking I/O. Beyond conventional chatbot paradigms, we pioneer a proactive interaction mechanism, which combines memory systems with Subjective Action Judgement module, enabling five human-like response strategies: interruption, refusal, deflection, silence, and standard response. The memory module dynamically aggregates historical, and contextual data to inform interaction decisions. This approach breaks the rigid turn-based convention by allowing system-initiated dialog control and context-aware response selection. And we propose Action Judgement SFT that assesses input streams for responses strategies. The framework's single-file implementation with atomic configurations offers researchers unprecedented transparency and extensibility for interaction agents. The code of CleanS2S is released at \https://github.com/opendilab/CleanS2S.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have propelled research in natural language interfaces to databases. However, most state-of-the-art text-to- SQL systems still depend on complex, multi-stage pipelines. This work proposes a novel agentic framework that unifies schema linking, query generation, and itera- tive refinement within a single, end-to-end component. By leveraging the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs, our method emulates how humans answer questions when working with unfamiliar databases: understanding the data by formulating hypotheses, running dynamic queries to validate them, reasoning over the results, and revising outputs based on observed results. Crucially, our approach intro- duces a new strategy for scaling test-time computation in text-to-SQL: we scale the depth of interactive database exploration and reflection. This shift enables the model to allocate computation dynamically to better understand the data, especially useful in ambiguous and underspecified scenarios. Our experiments show that it improved the Execution Accuracy (EX) from 44.8% to 56.5% on the challenging BIRD dataset using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B. Fur- thermore, when equipped with steps to add more diversity to the answers, our agent achieves a Best-of-N accuracy of 81.8% with 8 rounds of candidate gener- ation, rivaling the 82.79% achieved by the top-ranked published solution, while reducing engineering complexity. These findings position our unified framework as a promising alternative for building natural language interfaces to databases.

<title>ReAgent-V: A Reward-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: Video understanding is fundamental to tasks such as action recognition, video reasoning, and robotic control. Early video understanding methods based on large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically adopt a single-pass reasoning paradigm without dynamic feedback, limiting the model's capacity to self-correct and adapt in complex scenarios. Recent efforts have attempted to address this limitation by incorporating reward models and reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning, or by employing tool-agent frameworks. However, these approaches face several challenges, including high annotation costs, reward signals that fail to capture real-time reasoning states, and low inference efficiency. To overcome these issues, we propose ReAgent-V, a novel agentic video understanding framework that integrates efficient frame selection with real-time reward generation during inference. These reward signals not only guide iterative answer refinement through a multi-perspective reflection mechanism-adjusting predictions from conservative, neutral, and aggressive viewpoints-but also enable automatic filtering of high-quality data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference optimization (DPO), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO). ReAgent-V is lightweight, modular, and extensible, supporting flexible tool integration tailored to diverse tasks. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets across three core applications-video understanding, video reasoning enhancement, and vision-language-action model alignment-demonstrate significant gains in generalization and reasoning, with improvements of up to 6.9%, 2.1%, and 9.8%, respectively, highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled multi-agent systems that simulate real-world interactions with near-human reasoning. While previous studies have extensively examined biases related to protected attributes such as race, the emergence and propagation of biases on socially contentious issues in multi-agent LLM interactions remain underexplored. This study explores how LLM agents shape public opinion through debates on five contentious topics. By simulating over 2,500 debates, we analyze how initially neutral agents, assigned a centrist disposition, adopt specific stances over time. Statistical analyses reveal significant group conformity mirroring human behavior; LLM agents tend to align with numerically dominant groups or more intelligent agents, exerting a greater influence. These findings underscore the crucial role of agent intelligence in shaping discourse and highlight the risks of bias amplification in online interactions. Our results emphasize the need for policy measures that promote diversity and transparency in LLM-generated discussions to mitigate the risks of bias propagation within anonymous online environments.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) decompose image classification into a process governed by interpretable, human-readable concepts. Recent advances in CBMs have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate candidate concepts. However, a critical question remains: What is the optimal number of concepts to use? Current concept banks suffer from redundancy or insufficient coverage. To address this issue, we introduce a dynamic, agent-based approach that adjusts the concept bank in response to environmental feedback, optimizing the number of concepts for sufficiency yet concise coverage. Moreover, we propose Conditional Concept Bottleneck Models (CoCoBMs) to overcome the limitations in traditional CBMs' concept scoring mechanisms. It enhances the accuracy of assessing each concept's contribution to classification tasks and feature an editable matrix that allows LLMs to correct concept scores that conflict with their internal knowledge. Our evaluations across 6 datasets show that our method not only improves classification accuracy by 6% but also enhances interpretability assessments by 30%.

Abstract: Flowcharts are a critical tool for visualizing decision-making processes. However, their non-linear structure and complex visual-textual relationships make it challenging to interpret them using LLMs, as vision-language models frequently hallucinate nonexistent connections and decision paths when analyzing these diagrams. This leads to compromised reliability for automated flowchart processing in critical domains such as logistics, health, and engineering. We introduce the task of Fine-grained Flowchart Attribution, which traces specific components grounding a flowchart referring LLM response. Flowchart Attribution ensures the verifiability of LLM predictions and improves explainability by linking generated responses to the flowchart's structure. We propose FlowPathAgent, a neurosymbolic agent that performs fine-grained post hoc attribution through graph-based reasoning. It first segments the flowchart, then converts it into a structured symbolic graph, and then employs an agentic approach to dynamically interact with the graph, to generate attribution paths. Additionally, we present FlowExplainBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating flowchart attributions across diverse styles, domains, and question types. Experimental results show that FlowPathAgent mitigates visual hallucinations in LLM answers over flowchart QA, outperforming strong baselines by 10-14% on our proposed FlowExplainBench dataset.

Abstract: The recent progress of large language model agents has opened new possibilities for automating tasks through graphical user interfaces (GUIs), especially in mobile environments where intelligent interaction can greatly enhance usability. However, practical deployment of such agents remains constrained by several key challenges. Existing training data is often noisy and lack semantic diversity, which hinders the learning of precise grounding and planning. Models trained purely by imitation tend to overfit to seen interface patterns and fail to generalize in unfamiliar scenarios. Moreover, most prior work focuses on English interfaces while overlooks the growing diversity of non-English applications such as those in the Chinese mobile ecosystem. In this work, we present AgentCPM-GUI, an 8B-parameter GUI agent built for robust and efficient on-device GUI interaction. Our training pipeline includes grounding-aware pre-training to enhance perception, supervised fine-tuning on high-quality Chinese and English trajectories to imitate human-like actions, and reinforcement fine-tuning with GRPO to improve reasoning capability. We also introduce a compact action space that reduces output length and supports low-latency execution on mobile devices. AgentCPM-GUI achieves state-of-the-art performance on five public benchmarks and a new Chinese GUI benchmark called CAGUI, reaching $96.9\%$ Type-Match and $91.3\%$ Exact-Match. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we publicly release all code, model checkpoint, and evaluation data.

Abstract: World model based planning has significantly improved decision-making in complex environments by enabling agents to simulate future states and make informed choices. However, ensuring the prediction accuracy of world models often demands substantial computational resources, posing a major challenge for real-time applications. This computational burden is particularly restrictive in robotics, where resources are severely constrained. To address this limitation, we propose a Sparse Imagination for Efficient Visual World Model Planning, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens processed during forward prediction. Our method leverages a sparsely trained vision-based world model based on transformers with randomized grouped attention strategy, allowing the model to adaptively adjust the number of tokens processed based on the computational resource. By enabling sparse imagination (rollout), our approach significantly accelerates planning while maintaining high control fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that sparse imagination preserves task performance while dramatically improving inference efficiency, paving the way for the deployment of world models in real-time decision-making scenarios.

Abstract: Visual Semantic Navigation (VSN) is a fundamental problem in robotics, where an agent must navigate toward a target object in an unknown environment, mainly using visual information. Most state-of-the-art VSN models are trained in simulation environments, where rendered scenes of the real world are used, at best. These approaches typically rely on raw RGB data from the virtual scenes, which limits their ability to generalize to real-world environments due to domain adaptation issues. To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose SEMNAV, a novel approach that leverages semantic segmentation as the main visual input representation of the environment to enhance the agent's perception and decision-making capabilities. By explicitly incorporating high-level semantic information, our model learns robust navigation policies that improve generalization across unseen environments, both in simulated and real world settings. We also introduce a newly curated dataset, i.e. the SEMNAV dataset, designed for training semantic segmentation-aware navigation models like SEMNAV. Our approach is evaluated extensively in both simulated environments and with real-world robotic platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMNAV outperforms existing state-of-the-art VSN models, achieving higher success rates in the Habitat 2.0 simulation environment, using the HM3D dataset. Furthermore, our real-world experiments highlight the effectiveness of semantic segmentation in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, making our model a promising solution for practical VSN-based robotic applications. We release SEMNAV dataset, code and trained models at https://github.com/gramuah/semnav

Abstract: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems serve as the digital backbone of modern financial institutions, yet they continue to rely on static, rule-based workflows that limit adaptability, scalability, and intelligence. As business operations grow more complex and data-rich, conventional ERP platforms struggle to integrate structured and unstructured data in real time and to accommodate dynamic, cross-functional workflows.
  In this paper, we present the first AI-native, agent-based framework for ERP systems, introducing a novel architecture of Generative Business Process AI Agents (GBPAs) that bring autonomy, reasoning, and dynamic optimization to enterprise workflows. The proposed system integrates generative AI with business process modeling and multi-agent orchestration, enabling end-to-end automation of complex tasks such as budget planning, financial reporting, and wire transfer processing. Unlike traditional workflow engines, GBPAs interpret user intent, synthesize workflows in real time, and coordinate specialized sub-agents for modular task execution. We validate the framework through case studies in bank wire transfers and employee reimbursements, two representative financial workflows with distinct complexity and data modalities. Results show that GBPAs achieve up to 40% reduction in processing time, 94% drop in error rate, and improved regulatory compliance by enabling parallelism, risk control insertion, and semantic reasoning. These findings highlight the potential of GBPAs to bridge the gap between generative AI capabilities and enterprise-grade automation, laying the groundwork for the next generation of intelligent ERP systems.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models has catalyzed two distinct yet interconnected paradigms in artificial intelligence: standalone AI Agents and collaborative Agentic AI ecosystems. This comprehensive study establishes a definitive framework for distinguishing these architectures through systematic analysis of their operational principles, structural compositions, and deployment methodologies. We characterize AI Agents as specialized, tool-enhanced systems leveraging foundation models for targeted automation within constrained environments. Conversely, Agentic AI represents sophisticated multi-entity frameworks where distributed agents exhibit emergent collective intelligence through coordinated interaction protocols. Our investigation traces the evolutionary trajectory from traditional rule-based systems through generative AI foundations to contemporary agent architectures. We present detailed architectural comparisons examining planning mechanisms, memory systems, coordination protocols, and decision-making processes. The study categorizes application landscapes, contrasting single-agent implementations in customer service and content management with multi-agent deployments in research automation and complex decision support. We identify critical challenges including reliability issues, coordination complexities, and scalability constraints, while proposing innovative solutions through enhanced reasoning frameworks, robust memory architectures, and improved coordination mechanisms. This framework provides essential guidance for practitioners selecting appropriate agentic approaches and establishes foundational principles for next-generation intelligent system development.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven breakthroughs in AI, from game-play to scientific discovery and AI alignment. However, its broader applicability remains limited by challenges such as low data efficiency and poor generalizability. Recent advances suggest that large language models, with their rich world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, could complement RL by enabling semantic state modeling and task-agnostic planning. In this work, we propose the Agentic Episodic Control (AEC), a novel architecture that integrates RL with LLMs to enhance decision-making. The AEC can leverage a large language model (LLM) to map the observations into language-grounded embeddings, which further can be stored in an episodic memory for rapid retrieval of high-value experiences. Simultaneously, a World-Graph working memory module is utilized to capture structured environmental dynamics in order to enhance relational reasoning. Furthermore, a lightweight critical state detector dynamically arbitrates between the episodic memory recall and the world-model-guided exploration. On the whole, by combining the trial-and-error learning scheme with LLM-derived semantic priors, the proposed AEC can improve both data efficiency and generalizability in reinforcement learning. In experiments on BabyAI-Text benchmark tasks, AEC demonstrates substantial improvements over existing baselines, especially on complex and generalization tasks like FindObj, where it outperforms the best baseline by up to 76%. The proposed AEC framework bridges the strengths of numeric reinforcement learning and symbolic reasoning, which provides a pathway toward more adaptable and sample-efficient agents.

<title>Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?</title>

Abstract: The terms Agentic AI and Multiagentic AI have recently gained popularity in discussions on generative artificial intelligence, often used to describe autonomous software agents and systems composed of such agents. However, the use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical origins of "agentic" in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms, agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in handling complex interactive problems. Existing LLM agents mainly generate natural language plans to guide reasoning, which is verbose and inefficient. NL plans are also tailored to specific tasks and restrict agents' ability to generalize across similar tasks. To this end, we explore pseudocode-style plans (P-code Plan) to capture the structural logic of reasoning. We find that P-code Plan empowers LLM agents with stronger generalization ability and more efficiency. Inspired by this finding, we propose a pseudocode-style Planning Guided Preference Optimization method called PGPO for effective agent learning. With two planning-oriented rewards, PGPO further enhances LLM agents' ability to generate high-quality P-code Plans and subsequent reasoning. Experiments show that PGPO achieves superior performance on representative agent benchmarks and outperforms the current leading baselines. Analyses reveal the advantage of PGPO in reducing action errors and omissions during reasoning.

<title>FormFactory: An Interactive Benchmarking Suite for Multimodal Form-Filling Agents</title>

Abstract: Online form filling is a common yet labor-intensive task involving extensive keyboard and mouse interactions. Despite the long-standing vision of automating this process with "one click", existing tools remain largely rule-based and lack generalizable, generative capabilities. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled promising agents for GUI-related tasks in general-purpose scenarios. However, they struggle with the unique challenges of form filling, such as flexible layouts and the difficulty of aligning textual instructions with on-screen fields. To bridge this gap, we formally define the form-filling task and propose FormFactory, an interactive benchmarking suite comprising a web-based interface, backend evaluation module, and carefully constructed dataset. Our benchmark covers diverse real-world scenarios, incorporates various field formats, and simulates high-fidelity form interactions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs and observe that no model surpasses 5% accuracy, underscoring the inherent difficulty of the task. These findings also reveal significant limitations in current models' visual layout reasoning and field-value alignment abilities. We hope our benchmark can serve as a stepping stone for further research into robust, practical form-filling agents.

Abstract: High-quality math datasets are crucial for advancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing datasets often suffer from three key issues: outdated and insufficient challenging content, neglecting human-like reasoning, and limited reliability due to single-LLM generation. To address these, we introduce $\textbf{STORM-BORN}$, an ultra-challenging dataset of mathematical derivations sourced from cutting-edge academic papers, which includes dense human-like approximations and heuristic cues. To ensure the reliability and quality, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop, multi-agent data generation framework, integrating reasoning-dense filters, multi-agent collaboration, and human mathematicians' evaluations. We curated a set of 2,000 synthetic samples and deliberately selected the 100 most difficult problems. Even most advanced models like GPT-o1 solved fewer than $5\%$ of them. Fine-tuning on STORM-BORN boosts accuracy by $7.84\%$ (LLaMA3-8B) and $9.12\%$ (Qwen2.5-7B). As AI approaches mathematician-level reasoning, STORM-BORN provides both a high-difficulty benchmark and a human-like reasoning training resource. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/lwhere/STORM-BORN.

Abstract: Building Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents which can navigate following natural language instructions is a long-standing goal in human-robot interaction applications. Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for improving navigation, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches primarily adopt direct input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning framework for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation, dubbed EvolveNav. Our EvolveNav consists of two stages: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with formalized CoT labels to both activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities and increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also introduced to encourage learning correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results on the popular VLN benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/EvolveNav.

Abstract: Being able to solve a task in diverse ways makes agents more robust to task variations and less prone to local optima. In this context, constrained diversity optimization has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train a diverse set of agents in parallel. However, existing constrained-diversity RL methods often under-explore in complex tasks such as robotic manipulation, leading to a lack in policy diversity. To improve diversity optimization in RL, we therefore propose a curriculum that first explores at the trajectory level before learning step-based policies. In our empirical evaluation, we provide novel insights into the shortcoming of skill-based diversity optimization, and demonstrate empirically that our curriculum improves the diversity of the learned skills.

<title>MLA-Trust: Benchmarking Trustworthiness of Multimodal LLM Agents in GUI Environments</title>

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal LLM-based agents (MLAs) has transformed interaction paradigms by seamlessly integrating vision, language, action and dynamic environments, enabling unprecedented autonomous capabilities across GUI applications ranging from web automation to mobile systems. However, MLAs introduce critical trustworthiness challenges that extend far beyond traditional language models' limitations, as they can directly modify digital states and trigger irreversible real-world consequences. Existing benchmarks inadequately tackle these unique challenges posed by MLAs' actionable outputs, long-horizon uncertainty and multimodal attack vectors. In this paper, we introduce MLA-Trust, the first comprehensive and unified framework that evaluates the MLA trustworthiness across four principled dimensions: truthfulness, controllability, safety and privacy. We utilize websites and mobile applications as realistic testbeds, designing 34 high-risk interactive tasks and curating rich evaluation datasets. Large-scale experiments involving 13 state-of-the-art agents reveal previously unexplored trustworthiness vulnerabilities unique to multimodal interactive scenarios. For instance, proprietary and open-source GUI-interacting MLAs pose more severe trustworthiness risks than static MLLMs, particularly in high-stakes domains; the transition from static MLLMs into interactive MLAs considerably compromises trustworthiness, enabling harmful content generation in multi-step interactions that standalone MLLMs would typically prevent; multi-step execution, while enhancing the adaptability of MLAs, involves latent nonlinear risk accumulation across successive interactions, circumventing existing safeguards and resulting in unpredictable derived risks. Moreover, we present an extensible toolbox to facilitate continuous evaluation of MLA trustworthiness across diverse interactive environments.

Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.

arXiv:2506.01623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans excel at analogical reasoning - applying knowledge from one task to a related one with minimal relearning. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically require extensive retraining even when new tasks share structural similarities with previously learned ones. In this work, we propose MAGIK, a novel framework that enables RL agents to transfer knowledge to analogous tasks without interacting with the target environment. Our approach leverages an imagination mechanism to map entities in the target task to their analogues in the source domain, allowing the agent to reuse its original policy. Experiments on custom MiniGrid and MuJoCo tasks show that MAGIK achieves effective zero-shot transfer using only a small number of human-labelled examples. We compare our approach to related baselines and highlight how it offers a novel and effective mechanism for knowledge transfer via imagination-based analogy mapping.

Abstract: The development of AI agents based on large, open-domain language models (LLMs) has paved the way for the development of general-purpose AI assistants that can support human in tasks such as writing, coding, graphic design, and scientific research. A major challenge with such agents is that, by necessity, they are trained by observing relatively short-term interactions with humans. Such models can fail to generalize to long-term interactions, for example, interactions where a user has repeatedly corrected mistakes on the part of the agent. In this work, we argue that these challenges can be overcome by explicitly modeling humans' social intelligence, that is, their ability to build and maintain long-term relationships with other agents whose behavior cannot always be predicted. By mathematically modeling the strategies humans use to communicate and reason about one another over long periods of time, we may be able to derive new game theoretic objectives against which LLMs and future AI agents may be optimized.

<title>A Hierarchical Bin Packing Framework with Dual Manipulators via Heuristic Search and Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01628</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01628</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the bin packing problem (BPP), which aims to maximize bin utilization when packing a variety of items. The offline problem, where the complete information about the item set and their sizes is known in advance, is proven to be NP-hard. The semi-online and online variants are even more challenging, as full information about incoming items is unavailable. While existing methods have tackled both 2D and 3D BPPs, the 2D BPP remains underexplored in terms of fully maximizing utilization. We propose a hierarchical approach for solving the 2D online and semi-online BPP by combining deep reinforcement learning (RL) with heuristic search. The heuristic search selects which item to pack or unpack, determines the packing order, and chooses the orientation of each item, while the RL agent decides the precise position within the bin. Our method is capable of handling diverse scenarios, including repacking, varying levels of item information, differing numbers of accessible items, and coordination of dual manipulators. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves near-optimal utilization across various practical scenarios, largely due to its repacking capability. In addition, the algorithm is evaluated in a physics-based simulation environment, where execution time is measured to assess its real-world performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) often struggle to interpret high-resolution images accurately, where fine-grained details are crucial for complex visual understanding. We introduce Zoom-Refine, a novel training-free method that enhances MLLM capabilities to address this issue. Zoom-Refine operates through a synergistic process of \textit{Localized Zoom} and \textit{Self-Refinement}. In the \textit{Localized Zoom} step, Zoom-Refine leverages the MLLM to provide a preliminary response to an input query and identifies the most task-relevant image region by predicting its bounding box coordinates. During the \textit{Self-Refinement} step, Zoom-Refine then integrates fine-grained details from the high-resolution crop (identified by \textit{Localized Zoom}) with its initial reasoning to re-evaluate and refine its preliminary response. Our method harnesses the MLLM's inherent capabilities for spatial localization, contextual reasoning and comparative analysis without requiring additional training or external experts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of Zoom-Refine on two challenging high-resolution multimodal benchmarks. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/xavier-yu114/Zoom-Refine}{\color{magenta}github.com/xavier-yu114/Zoom-Refine}

<title>Geometry Meets Incentives: Sample-Efficient Incentivized Exploration with Linear Contexts</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01685</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the incentivized exploration model, a principal aims to explore and learn over time by interacting with a sequence of self-interested agents. It has been recently understood that the main challenge in designing incentive-compatible algorithms for this problem is to gather a moderate amount of initial data, after which one can obtain near-optimal regret via posterior sampling. With high-dimensional contexts, however, this \emph{initial exploration} phase requires exponential sample complexity in some cases, which prevents efficient learning unless initial data can be acquired exogenously. We show that these barriers to exploration disappear under mild geometric conditions on the set of available actions, in which case incentive-compatibility does not preclude regret-optimality. Namely, we consider the linear bandit model with actions in the Euclidean unit ball, and give an incentive-compatible exploration algorithm with sample complexity that scales polynomially with the dimension and other parameters.

<title>A Descriptive and Normative Theory of Human Beliefs in RLHF</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human preferences in RLHF are typically modeled as a function of the human's reward function or corresponding optimal state-action values. In this work, we propose that human beliefs about the capabilities of the agent being trained also play a key role in preference generation. We examine two questions related to this hypothesis, one descriptive and one normative, respectively: Do human labelers' beliefs about agent capabilities affect the preferences that they provide? And what is the ideal set of beliefs about an agent -- and resulting preferences -- for humans to have? We propose a new preference model that incorporates human beliefs and provide a normative theory that bounds the error on the final learned policy based on the \textit{mismatch} between the human's beliefs and an idealized set of beliefs. We then confirm via a human study that beliefs about agent capabilities do, in fact, significantly affect preferences and can be influenced through simple interventions. Additionally, we empirically show through synthetic experiments that it is often suboptimal for human preference labelers to assume agent optimality. Collectively, these results theoretically and empirically demonstrate how reducing the mismatch between human beliefs and agent capabilities can lead to more performant RLHF and point toward new best practices for RLHF practitioners.

Abstract: Large language models are quickly becoming the foundation for intelligent agents that are capable of using tools. However, training such agents is challenging because it requires human creation and annotation of a diverse set of tasks, tools, and evaluation criteria. In this paper, we propose the Self-Challenging framework for training an agent on high-quality tasks that are generated by itself. The agent first plays the role of challenger and generates a task after interacting with the given tools. The tasks take the form of a novel general class of problems termed Code-as-Task, which are defined by an instruction, a verification function and solution and failure cases which serve as tests, allowing to filter only for high-quality tasks. The agent then takes an executor role and trains on those tasks with reinforcement learning using the evaluation feedback as a reward. Evaluation on two existing multi-turn tool-use agent benchmarks, M3ToolEval and TauBench, shows the Self-Challenging framework achieves over a two-fold improvement in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, despite using only self-generated training data.

<title>Enhancing Customer Service Chatbots with Context-Aware NLU through Selective Attention and Multi-task Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01781</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customer service chatbots are conversational systems aimed at addressing customer queries, often by directing them to automated workflows. A crucial aspect of this process is the classification of the customer's intent. Presently, most intent classification models for customer care utilise only customer query for intent prediction. This may result in low-accuracy models, which cannot handle ambiguous queries. An ambiguous query like "I didn't receive my package" could indicate a delayed order, or an order that was delivered but the customer failed to receive it. Resolution of each of these scenarios requires the execution of very different sequence of steps. Utilizing additional information, such as the customer's order delivery status, in the right manner can help identify the intent for such ambiguous queries. In this paper, we have introduced a context-aware NLU model that incorporates both, the customer query and contextual information from the customer's order status for predicting customer intent. A novel selective attention module is used to extract relevant context features. We have also proposed a multi-task learning paradigm for the effective utilization of different label types available in our training data. Our suggested method, Multi-Task Learning Contextual NLU with Selective Attention Weighted Context (MTL-CNLU-SAWC), yields a 4.8% increase in top 2 accuracy score over the baseline model which only uses user queries, and a 3.5% improvement over existing state-of-the-art models that combine query and context. We have deployed our model to production for Walmart's customer care domain. Accurate intent prediction through MTL-CNLU-SAWC helps to better direct customers to automated workflows, thereby significantly reducing escalations to human agents, leading to almost a million dollars in yearly savings for the company.

Abstract: This paper provides an in-depth technical analysis and implementation methodology of the open-source Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol developed by Google and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduced by Anthropic. While the evolution of LLM-based autonomous agents is rapidly accelerating, efficient interactions among these agents and their integration with external systems remain significant challenges. In modern AI systems, collaboration between autonomous agents and integration with external tools have become essential elements for building practical AI applications. A2A offers a standardized communication method that enables agents developed in heterogeneous environments to collaborate effectively, while MCP provides a structured I/O framework for agents to connect with external tools and resources. Prior studies have focused primarily on the features and applications of either A2A or MCP individually. In contrast, this study takes an integrated approach, exploring how the two protocols can complement each other to address interoperability issues and facilitate efficient collaboration within complex agent ecosystems.

<title>The Ultimate Test of Superintelligent AI Agents: Can an AI Balance Care and Control in Asymmetric Relationships?</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces the Shepherd Test, a new conceptual test for assessing the moral and relational dimensions of superintelligent artificial agents. The test is inspired by human interactions with animals, where ethical considerations about care, manipulation, and consumption arise in contexts of asymmetric power and self-preservation. We argue that AI crosses an important, and potentially dangerous, threshold of intelligence when it exhibits the ability to manipulate, nurture, and instrumentally use less intelligent agents, while also managing its own survival and expansion goals. This includes the ability to weigh moral trade-offs between self-interest and the well-being of subordinate agents. The Shepherd Test thus challenges traditional AI evaluation paradigms by emphasizing moral agency, hierarchical behavior, and complex decision-making under existential stakes. We argue that this shift is critical for advancing AI governance, particularly as AI systems become increasingly integrated into multi-agent environments. We conclude by identifying key research directions, including the development of simulation environments for testing moral behavior in AI, and the formalization of ethical manipulation within multi-agent systems.

<title>Beyond Static Responses: Multi-Agent LLM Systems as a New Paradigm for Social Science Research</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) transition from static tools to fully agentic systems, their potential for transforming social science research has become increasingly evident. This paper introduces a structured framework for understanding the diverse applications of LLM-based agents, ranging from simple data processors to complex, multi-agent systems capable of simulating emergent social dynamics. By mapping this developmental continuum across six levels, the paper clarifies the technical and methodological boundaries between different agentic architectures, providing a comprehensive overview of current capabilities and future potential. It highlights how lower-tier systems streamline conventional tasks like text classification and data annotation, while higher-tier systems enable novel forms of inquiry, including the study of group dynamics, norm formation, and large-scale social processes. However, these advancements also introduce significant challenges, including issues of reproducibility, ethical oversight, and the risk of emergent biases. The paper critically examines these concerns, emphasizing the need for robust validation protocols, interdisciplinary collaboration, and standardized evaluation metrics. It argues that while LLM-based agents hold transformative potential for the social sciences, realizing this promise will require careful, context-sensitive deployment and ongoing methodological refinement. The paper concludes with a call for future research that balances technical innovation with ethical responsibility, encouraging the development of agentic systems that not only replicate but also extend the frontiers of social science, offering new insights into the complexities of human behavior.

Abstract: We introduce Conversational Function-Calling Evaluation Through Turn-Level Interactions (CONFETTI), a conversational benchmark1 designed to evaluate the function-calling capabilities and response quality of large language models (LLMs). Current benchmarks lack comprehensive assessment of LLMs in complex conversational scenarios. CONFETTI addresses this gap through 109 human-simulated conversations, comprising 313 user turns and covering 86 APIs. These conversations explicitly target various conversational complexities, such as follow-ups, goal correction and switching, ambiguous and implicit goals. We perform off-policy turn-level evaluation using this benchmark targeting function-calling. Our benchmark also incorporates dialog act annotations to assess agent responses. We evaluate a series of state-of-the-art LLMs and analyze their performance with respect to the number of available APIs, conversation lengths, and chained function calling. Our results reveal that while some models are able to handle long conversations, and leverage more than 20+ APIs successfully, other models struggle with longer context or when increasing the number of APIs. We also report that the performance on chained function-calls is severely limited across the models. Overall, the top performing models on CONFETTI are Nova Pro (40.01%), Claude Sonnet v3.5 (35.46%) and Llama 3.1 405B (33.19%) followed by command-r-plus (31.18%) and Mistral-Large-2407 (30.07%).

<title>Pearl: Automatic Code Optimization Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Compilers are crucial in optimizing programs and accelerating their execution. However, optimizing programs automatically using compilers is not trivial. Recent work has attempted to use reinforcement learning (RL) to solve this problem. It has limitations though. Current methods either do not support the optimization of general loop nests or can only be used to optimize loop nests seen during training. In this paper, we propose Pearl, a novel framework that uses deep reinforcement learning to automate compiler code optimization. It uses an RL agent to select the sequence of code optimizations a compiler should apply to make the input code run faster. This agent can optimize general loop nests and can generalize to programs unseen during training. To enable the optimization of general loop nests, we propose a novel representation of the action space that allows the RL agent to select on which part of the loop nest a given code optimization should be applied. Training RL agents for loop nest optimization is slow and data-intensive. We accelerate this process by caching results and pre-training the agent. Integrated with the Tiramisu compiler, our approach streamlines optimization and outperforms existing methods. To the best of our knowledge, Pearl is the first RL-based system to support general programs composed of loop nests manipulating tensors while still being able to generalize to programs unseen during training. It is also the first to support the class of polyhedral optimizations, a class of advanced loop nest optimizations. We evaluate Pearl on a set of benchmarks, and demonstrate competitive performance improvements over state-of-the-art compilers. Notably, Pearl achieves a geometric mean speedup of 2.02x compared to Tiramisu and 3.36x compared to Pluto.

<title>WHEN TO ACT, WHEN TO WAIT: Modeling Structural Trajectories for Intent Triggerability in Task-Oriented Dialogue</title>

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue systems often face difficulties when user utterances seem semantically complete but lack necessary structural information for appropriate system action. This arises because users frequently do not fully understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions. Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for collaborative intent formation. We present STORM, a framework modeling asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding development. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design.

Abstract: The meteoric rise and proliferation of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents promise significant capabilities across various domains. However, their deployment is increasingly constrained by substantial computational demands, specifically for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) resources. This paper addresses the critical problem of optimizing resource utilization in LLM agent systems. We introduce COALESCE (Cost-Optimized and Secure Agent Labour Exchange via Skill-based Competence Estimation), a novel framework designed to enable autonomous LLM agents to dynamically outsource specific subtasks to specialized, cost-effective third-party LLM agents. The framework integrates mechanisms for hybrid skill representation, dynamic skill discovery, automated task decomposition, a unified cost model comparing internal execution costs against external outsourcing prices, simplified market-based decision-making algorithms, and a standardized communication protocol between LLM agents. Comprehensive validation through 239 theoretical simulations demonstrates 41.8\% cost reduction potential, while large-scale empirical validation across 240 real LLM tasks confirms 20.3\% cost reduction with proper epsilon-greedy exploration, establishing both theoretical viability and practical effectiveness. The emergence of proposed open standards like Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol further underscores the need for frameworks like COALESCE that can leverage such standards for efficient agent interaction. By facilitating a dynamic market for agent capabilities, potentially utilizing protocols like A2A for communication, COALESCE aims to significantly reduce operational costs, enhance system scalability, and foster the emergence of specialized agent economies, making complex LLM agent functionalities more accessible and economically viable.

Abstract: Game-theoretic agents must make plans that optimally gather information about their opponents. These problems are modeled by partially observable stochastic games (POSGs), but planning in fully continuous POSGs is intractable without heavy offline computation or assumptions on the order of belief maintained by each player. We formulate a finite history/horizon refinement of POSGs which admits competitive information gathering behavior in trajectory space, and through a series of approximations, we present an online method for computing rational trajectory plans in these games which leverages particle-based estimations of the joint state space and performs stochastic gradient play. We also provide the necessary adjustments required to deploy this method on individual agents. The method is tested in continuous pursuit-evasion and warehouse-pickup scenarios (alongside extensions to $N > 2$ players and to more complex environments with visual and physical obstacles), demonstrating evidence of active information gathering and outperforming passive competitors.

<title>Should Decision-Makers Reveal Classifiers in Online Strategic Classification?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01936</link>

Abstract: Strategic classification addresses a learning problem where a decision-maker implements a classifier over agents who may manipulate their features in order to receive favorable predictions. In the standard model of online strategic classification, in each round, the decision-maker implements and publicly reveals a classifier, after which agents perfectly best respond based on this knowledge. However, in practice, whether to disclose the classifier is often debated -- some decision-makers believe that hiding the classifier can prevent misclassification errors caused by manipulation.
  In this paper, we formally examine how limiting the agents' access to the current classifier affects the decision-maker's performance. Specifically, we consider an extended online strategic classification setting where agents lack direct knowledge about the current classifier and instead manipulate based on a weighted average of historically implemented classifiers. Our main result shows that in this setting, the decision-maker incurs $(1-\gamma)^{-1}$ or $k_{\text{in}}$ times more mistakes compared to the full-knowledge setting, where $k_{\text{in}}$ is the maximum in-degree of the manipulation graph (representing how many distinct feature vectors can be manipulated to appear as a single one), and $\gamma$ is the discount factor indicating agents' memory of past classifiers. Our results demonstrate how withholding access to the classifier can backfire and degrade the decision-maker's performance in online strategic classification.

Abstract: Powered by a large language model (LLM), a web browsing agent operates web browsers in a human-like manner and offers a highly transparent path toward automating a wide range of everyday tasks. As web agents become increasingly capable and demonstrate proficiency in general browsing tasks, a critical question emerges: Can they go beyond general browsing to robustly handle tasks that are tedious and complex, or chores that humans often avoid doing themselves? In this paper, we introduce WebChoreArena, a new fully reproducible benchmark comprising 532 carefully curated tasks designed to extend the scope of WebArena beyond general browsing to more labor-intensive and tedious tasks. WebChoreArena systematically integrates three key challenges: (i) Massive Memory tasks requiring accurate retrieval of large amounts of information in the observations, (ii) Calculation tasks demanding precise mathematical reasoning, and (iii) Long-Term Memory tasks necessitating long-term memory across multiple webpages. Built on top of the fully reproducible and widely adopted four WebArena simulation environments, WebChoreArena ensures strict reproducibility and enables fair, direct comparisons with the established WebArena benchmark, offering key insights into agent progress. Our experimental results demonstrate that as LLMs evolve, represented by GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, significant improvements in performance are observed on WebChoreArena. These findings suggest that WebChoreArena is well-suited to measure the advancement of state-of-the-art LLMs with greater clarity. Nevertheless, the results also indicate that even with Gemini 2.5 Pro, there remains substantial room for improvement compared to WebArena, highlighting the increased challenges posed by WebChoreArena.

Abstract: Potato functional genomics lags due to unsystematic gene information curation, gene identifier inconsistencies across reference genome versions, and the increasing volume of research publications. To address these limitations, we developed the Potato Knowledge Hub (http://www.potato-ai.top), leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a systematically curated collection of over 3,200 high-quality potato research papers spanning over 120 years. This platform integrates two key modules: a functional gene database containing 2,571 literature-reported genes, meticulously mapped to the latest DMv8.1 reference genome with resolved nomenclature discrepancies and links to original publications; and a potato knowledge base. The knowledge base, built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, accurately answers research queries with literature citations, mitigating LLM "hallucination." Users can interact with the hub via a natural language AI agent, "Potato Research Assistant," for querying specialized knowledge, retrieving gene information, and extracting sequences. The continuously updated Potato Knowledge Hub aims to be a comprehensive resource, fostering advancements in potato functional genomics and supporting breeding programs.

Abstract: Autonomy is a hallmark of animal intelligence, enabling adaptive and intelligent behavior in complex environments without relying on external reward or task structure. Existing reinforcement learning approaches to exploration in sparse reward and reward-free environments, including class of methods known as intrinsic motivation, exhibit inconsistent exploration patterns and thus fail to produce robust autonomous behaviors observed in animals. Moreover, systems neuroscience has largely overlooked the neural basis of autonomy, focusing instead on experimental paradigms where animals are motivated by external reward rather than engaging in unconstrained, naturalistic and task-independent behavior. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel model-based intrinsic drive explicitly designed to capture robust autonomous exploration observed in animals. Our method (3M-Progress) motivates naturalistic behavior by tracking divergence between the agent's current world model and an ethological prior. We demonstrate that artificial embodied agents trained with 3M-Progress capture the explainable variance in behavioral patterns and whole-brain neural-glial dynamics recorded from autonomously-behaving larval zebrafish, introducing the first goal-driven, population-level model of neural-glial computation. Our findings establish a computational framework connecting model-based intrinsic motivation to naturalistic behavior, providing a foundation for building artificial agents with animal-like autonomy.

Abstract: Can AI effectively perform complex econometric analysis traditionally requiring human expertise? This paper evaluates an agentic AI's capability to master econometrics, focusing on empirical analysis performance. We develop an ``Econometrics AI Agent'' built on the open-source MetaGPT framework. This agent exhibits outstanding performance in: (1) planning econometric tasks strategically, (2) generating and executing code, (3) employing error-based reflection for improved robustness, and (4) allowing iterative refinement through multi-round conversations. We construct two datasets from academic coursework materials and published research papers to evaluate performance against real-world challenges. Comparative testing shows our domain-specialized agent significantly outperforms both benchmark large language models (LLMs) and general-purpose AI agents. This work establishes a testbed for exploring AI's impact on social science research and enables cost-effective integration of domain expertise, making advanced econometric methods accessible to users with minimal coding expertise. Furthermore, our agent enhances research reproducibility and offers promising pedagogical applications for econometrics teaching.

Abstract: In this study, we focus on heart murmur classification (HMC) and hypothesize that combining neural audio codec representations (NACRs) such as EnCodec with spectral features (SFs), such as MFCC, will yield superior performance. We believe such fusion will trigger their complementary behavior as NACRs excel at capturing fine-grained acoustic patterns such as rhythm changes, spectral features focus on frequency-domain properties such as harmonic structure, spectral energy distribution crucial for analyzing the complex of heart sounds. To this end, we propose, BAOMI, a novel framework banking on novel bandit-based cross-attention mechanism for effective fusion. Here, a agent provides more weightage to most important heads in multi-head cross-attention mechanism and helps in mitigating the noise. With BAOMI, we report the topmost performance in comparison to individual NACRs, SFs, and baseline fusion techniques and setting new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Training a robotic arm to accomplish real-world tasks has been attracting increasing attention in both academia and industry. This work discusses the role of computer vision algorithms in this field. We focus on low-cost arms on which no sensors are equipped and thus all decisions are made upon visual recognition, e.g., real-time 3D pose estimation. This requires annotating a lot of training data, which is not only time-consuming but also laborious.
  In this paper, we present an alternative solution, which uses a 3D model to create a large number of synthetic data, trains a vision model in this virtual domain, and applies it to real-world images after domain adaptation. To this end, we design a semi-supervised approach, which fully leverages the geometric constraints among keypoints. We apply an iterative algorithm for optimization. Without any annotations on real images, our algorithm generalizes well and produces satisfying results on 3D pose estimation, which is evaluated on two real-world datasets. We also construct a vision-based control system for task accomplishment, for which we train a reinforcement learning agent in a virtual environment and apply it to the real-world. Moreover, our approach, with merely a 3D model being required, has the potential to generalize to other types of multi-rigid-body dynamic systems. Website: https://qiuwch.github.io/craves.ai.

Abstract: Fair allocation of indivisible goods studies allocating $m$ goods among $n$ agents in a fair manner. While fairness is a fundamental requirement in many real-world applications, it often conflicts with (economic) efficiency. This raises a natural and important question: How can we identify the most welfare-efficient allocation among all fair allocations? This paper answers from the perspective of computational complexity. Specifically, we study the problem of maximizing utilitarian social welfare under two widely studied fairness criteria: envy-freeness up to any item (EFX) and envy-freeness up to one item (EF1). We examine both normalized and unnormalized valuations, where normalized valuations require that each agent's total utility for all items is identical.
  The key contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: (i) we sketch the complete complexity landscape of welfare maximization subject to fair allocation constraints; and (ii) we provide interesting bounds on the price of fairness for both EFX and EF1. Specifically: (1) For $n=2$ agents, we develop polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTAS) and provide NP-hardness results for EFX and EF1 constraints; (2) For $n>2$ agents, under EFX constraints, we design algorithms that achieve approximation ratios of $O(n)$ and $O(\sqrt{n})$ for unnormalized and normalized valuations, respectively. These results are complemented by asymptotically tight inapproximability results. We also obtain similar results for EF1 constraints; (3) When the number of agents is a fixed constant, we show that the optimal solution can be computed in polynomial time by slightly relaxing the fairness constraints, whereas exact fairness leads to strong inapproximability; (4) Furthermore, our results imply the price of EFX is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ for normalized valuations, which is unknown in the literature.

Abstract: The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly increasing in applications ranging from surveillance and first-aid missions to industrial automation involving cooperation with other machines or humans. To maximize area coverage and reduce mission latency, swarms of collaborating drones have become a significant research direction. However, this approach requires open challenges in positioning, mapping, and communications to be addressed. This work describes a distributed mapping system based on a swarm of nano-UAVs, characterized by a limited payload of 35 g and tightly constrained onboard sensing and computing capabilities. Each nano-UAV is equipped with four 64-pixel depth sensors that measure the relative distance to obstacles in four directions. The proposed system merges the information from the swarm and generates a coherent grid map without relying on any external infrastructure. The data fusion is performed using the iterative closest point algorithm and a graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm, running entirely onboard the UAV's low-power ARM Cortex-M microcontroller with just 192 kB of memory. Field results gathered in three different mazes with a swarm of up to 4 nano-UAVs prove a mapping accuracy of 12 cm and demonstrate that the mapping time is inversely proportional to the number of agents. The proposed framework scales linearly in terms of communication bandwidth and onboard computational complexity, supporting communication between up to 20 nano-UAVs and mapping of areas up to 180 m2 with the chosen configuration requiring only 50 kB of memory.

Abstract: When interacting with other decision-making agents in non-adversarial scenarios, it is critical for an autonomous agent to have inferable behavior: The agent's actions must convey their intention and strategy. We model the inferability problem using Stackelberg games with observations where a leader and a follower repeatedly interact. During the interactions, the leader uses a fixed mixed strategy. The follower does not know the leader's strategy and dynamically reacts to the statistically inferred strategy based on the leader's previous actions. In the inference setting, the leader may have a lower performance compared to the setting where the follower has full information on the leader's strategy. We refer to the performance gap between these settings as the inferability gap. For a variety of game settings, we show that the inferability gap is upper-bounded by a function of the number of interactions and the stochasticity level of the leader's strategy, encouraging the use of inferable strategies with lower stochasticity levels. We also analyze bimatrix Stackelberg games and identify a set of games where the leader's near-optimal strategy may potentially suffer from a large inferability gap.

Abstract: Data standardization is a crucial part of the data science life cycle. While tools like Pandas offer robust functionalities, their complexity and the manual effort required for customizing code to diverse column types pose significant challenges. Although large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown promise in automating this process through natural language understanding and code generation, it still demands expert-level programming knowledge and continuous interaction for prompt refinement. To solve these challenges, our key idea is to propose a Python library with declarative, unified APIs for standardizing different column types, simplifying the LLM's code generation with concise API calls. We first propose Dataprep.Clean, a component of the Dataprep Python Library, significantly reduces the coding complexity by enabling the standardization of specific column types with a single line of code. Then, we introduce the CleanAgent framework integrating Dataprep.Clean and LLM-based agents to automate the data standardization process. With CleanAgent, data scientists only need to provide their requirements once, allowing for a hands-free process. To demonstrate the practical utility of CleanAgent, we developed a user-friendly web application, allowing users to interact with it using real-world datasets.

Abstract: Social biases can manifest in language agency. However, very limited research has investigated such biases in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated content. In addition, previous works often rely on string-matching techniques to identify agentic and communal words within texts, falling short of accurately classifying language agency. We introduce the Language Agency Bias Evaluation (LABE) benchmark, which comprehensively evaluates biases in LLMs by analyzing agency levels attributed to different demographic groups in model generations. LABE tests for gender, racial, and intersectional language agency biases in LLMs on 3 text generation tasks: biographies, professor reviews, and reference letters. Using LABE, we unveil language agency social biases in 3 recent LLMs: ChatGPT, Llama3, and Mistral. We observe that: (1) LLM generations tend to demonstrate greater gender bias than human-written texts; (2) Models demonstrate remarkably higher levels of intersectional bias than the other bias aspects. (3) Prompt-based mitigation is unstable and frequently leads to bias exacerbation. Based on our observations, we propose Mitigation via Selective Rewrite (MSR), a novel bias mitigation strategy that leverages an agency classifier to identify and selectively revise parts of generated texts that demonstrate communal traits. Empirical results prove MSR to be more effective and reliable than prompt-based mitigation method, showing a promising research direction.

Abstract: The Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) is a probabilistic framework in which an agent learns a stochastic policy and flow functions to sample objects proportionally to an unnormalized reward function. A number of recent works explored connections between GFlowNets and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) RL, which modifies the standard objective of RL agents by learning an entropy-regularized objective. However, the relationship between GFlowNets and standard RL remains largely unexplored, despite the inherent similarities in their sequential decision-making nature. While GFlowNets can discover diverse solutions through specialized flow-matching objectives, connecting them can simplify their implementation through established RL principles and improve RL's diverse solution discovery capabilities. In this paper, we bridge this gap by revealing a fundamental connection between GFlowNets and one RL's most basic components -- policy evaluation. Surprisingly, we find that the value function obtained from evaluating a uniform policy is closely associated with the flow functions in GFlowNets through the lens of flow iteration under certain structural conditions. Building upon these insights, we introduce a rectified random policy evaluation (RPE) algorithm, which achieves the same reward-matching effect as GFlowNets based on simply evaluating a fixed random policy in these cases, offering a new perspective. Empirical results across extensive benchmarks demonstrate that RPE achieves competitive results compared to previous approaches, shedding light on the previously overlooked connection between (non-MaxEnt) RL and GFlowNets.

Abstract: Existing work on the alignment problem has focused mainly on (1) qualitative descriptions of the alignment problem; (2) attempting to align AI actions with human interests by focusing on value specification and learning; and/or (3) focusing on a single agent or on humanity as a monolith. Recent sociotechnical approaches highlight the need to understand complex misalignment among multiple human and AI agents. We address this gap by adapting a computational social science model of human contention to the alignment problem. Our model quantifies misalignment in large, diverse agent groups with potentially conflicting goals across various problem areas. Misalignment scores in our framework depend on the observed agent population, the domain in question, and conflict between agents' weighted preferences. Through simulations, we demonstrate how our model captures intuitive aspects of misalignment across different scenarios. We then apply our model to two case studies, including an autonomous vehicle setting, showcasing its practical utility. Our approach offers enhanced explanatory power for complex sociotechnical environments and could inform the design of more aligned AI systems in real-world applications.

Abstract: For modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as large language models (LLMs), the training paradigm has recently shifted to pre-training followed by fine-tuning. Furthermore, owing to dwindling open repositories of data and thanks to efforts to democratize access to AI models, pre-training is expected to increasingly migrate from the current centralized deployments to federated learning (FL) implementations. Meta-learning provides a general framework in which pre-training and fine-tuning can be formalized. Meta-learning-based personalized FL (meta-pFL) moves beyond basic personalization by targeting generalization to new agents and tasks. This paper studies the generalization performance of meta-pFL for a wireless setting in which the agents participating in the pre-training phase, i.e., meta-learning, are connected via a shared wireless channel to the server. Adopting over-the-air computing, we study the trade-off between generalization to new agents and tasks, on the one hand, and convergence, on the other hand. The trade-off arises from the fact that channel impairments may enhance generalization, while degrading convergence. Extensive numerical results validate the theory.

Abstract: Recent studies have delved into constructing generalist agents for open-world environments like Minecraft. Despite the encouraging results, existing efforts mainly focus on solving basic programmatic tasks, e.g., material collection and tool-crafting following the Minecraft tech-tree, treating the ObtainDiamond task as the ultimate goal. This limitation stems from the narrowly defined set of actions available to agents, requiring them to learn effective long-horizon strategies from scratch. Consequently, discovering diverse gameplay opportunities in the open world becomes challenging. In this work, we introduce Odyssey, a new framework that empowers Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with open-world skills to explore the vast Minecraft world. Odyssey comprises three key parts: (1) An interactive agent with an open-world skill library that consists of 40 primitive skills and 183 compositional skills. (2) A fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model trained on a large question-answering dataset with 390k+ instruction entries derived from the Minecraft Wiki. (3) A new agent capability benchmark includes the long-term planning task, the dynamic-immediate planning task, and the autonomous exploration task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Odyssey framework can effectively evaluate different capabilities of LLM-based agents. All datasets, model weights, and code are publicly available to motivate future research on more advanced autonomous agent solutions.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) heavily relies on the careful design of the reward function. However, accurately assigning rewards to each state-action pair in Long-Term Reinforcement Learning (LTRL) tasks remains a significant challenge. As a result, RL agents are often trained under expert guidance. Inspired by the ordinal utility theory in economics, we propose a novel reward estimation algorithm: ELO-Rating based Reinforcement Learning (ERRL). This approach features two key contributions. First, it uses expert preferences over trajectories rather than cardinal rewards (utilities) to compute the ELO rating of each trajectory as its reward. Second, a new reward redistribution algorithm is introduced to alleviate training instability in the absence of a fixed anchor reward. In long-term scenarios (up to 5000 steps), where traditional RL algorithms struggle, our method outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how expert preferences influence the results.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large models (LMs), the development of general-purpose intelligent agents powered by LMs has become a reality. It is foreseeable that in the near future, LM-driven general AI agents will serve as essential tools in production tasks, capable of autonomous communication and collaboration without human intervention. This paper investigates scenarios involving the autonomous collaboration of future LM agents. We review the current state of LM agents, the key technologies enabling LM agent collaboration, and the security and privacy challenges they face during cooperative operations. To this end, we first explore the foundational principles of LM agents, including their general architecture, key components, enabling technologies, and modern applications. We then discuss practical collaboration paradigms from data, computation, and knowledge perspectives to achieve connected intelligence among LM agents. After that, we analyze the security vulnerabilities and privacy risks associated with LM agents, particularly in multi-agent settings, examining underlying mechanisms and reviewing current and potential countermeasures. Lastly, we propose future research directions for building robust and secure LM agent ecosystems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of AI-driven agents across various tasks. However, existing agentic systems, whether based on fixed pipeline algorithms or pre-defined meta-learning frameworks, cannot search the whole agent design space due to the restriction of human-designed components, and thus might miss the globally optimal agent design. In this paper, we introduce G\"odel Agent, a self-evolving framework inspired by the G\"odel machine, enabling agents to recursively improve themselves without relying on predefined routines or fixed optimization algorithms. G\"odel Agent leverages LLMs to dynamically modify its own logic and behavior, guided solely by high-level objectives through prompting. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and complex agent tasks demonstrate that implementation of G\"odel Agent can achieve continuous self-improvement, surpassing manually crafted agents in performance, efficiency, and generalizability.

Abstract: Pre-trained generalist policies are rapidly gaining relevance in robot learning due to their promise of fast adaptation to novel, in-domain tasks. This adaptation often relies on collecting new demonstrations for a specific task of interest and applying imitation learning algorithms, such as behavioral cloning. However, as soon as several tasks need to be learned, we must decide which tasks should be demonstrated and how often? We study this multi-task problem and explore an interactive framework in which the agent adaptively selects the tasks to be demonstrated. We propose AMF (Active Multi-task Fine-tuning), an algorithm to maximize multi-task policy performance under a limited demonstration budget by collecting demonstrations yielding the largest information gain on the expert policy. We derive performance guarantees for AMF under regularity assumptions and demonstrate its empirical effectiveness to efficiently fine-tune neural policies in complex and high-dimensional environments.

Abstract: The loss of plasticity in learning agents, analogous to the solidification of neural pathways in biological brains, significantly impedes learning and adaptation in reinforcement learning due to its non-stationary nature. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel approach, {\it Neuroplastic Expansion} (NE), inspired by cortical expansion in cognitive science. NE maintains learnability and adaptability throughout the entire training process by dynamically growing the network from a smaller initial size to its full dimension. Our method is designed with three key components: (\textit{1}) elastic topology generation based on potential gradients, (\textit{2}) dormant neuron pruning to optimize network expressivity, and (\textit{3}) neuron consolidation via experience review to strike a balance in the plasticity-stability dilemma. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NE effectively mitigates plasticity loss and outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various tasks in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite environments. NE enables more adaptive learning in complex, dynamic environments, which represents a crucial step towards transitioning deep reinforcement learning from static, one-time training paradigms to more flexible, continually adapting models.

Abstract: Trajectory modeling, which includes research on trajectory data pattern mining and future prediction, has widespread applications in areas such as life services, urban transportation, and public administration. Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling. However, the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make effective and reliable trajectory modeling an important yet highly challenging endeavor, even for domain experts. In this paper, we propose \textit{TrajAgent}, a agent framework powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate robust and efficient trajectory modeling through automation modeling. This framework leverages and optimizes diverse specialized models to address various trajectory modeling tasks across different datasets effectively. In \textit{TrajAgent}, we first develop \textit{UniEnv}, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on \textit{UniEnv}, we introduce an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modeling across various trajectory tasks and data. Furthermore, we introduce collaborative learning schema between LLM-based agents and small speciallized models, to enhance the performance of the whole framework effectively. Extensive experiments on four tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{TrajAgent} in automated trajectory modeling, achieving a performance improvement of 2.38\%-34.96\% over baseline methods.

Abstract: Mobile agents are essential for automating tasks in complex and dynamic mobile environments. As foundation models evolve, the demands for agents that can adapt in real-time and process multimodal data have grown. This survey provides a comprehensive review of mobile agent technologies, focusing on recent advancements that enhance real-time adaptability and multimodal interaction. Recent evaluation benchmarks have been developed better to capture the static and interactive environments of mobile tasks, offering more accurate assessments of agents' performance. We then categorize these advancements into two main approaches: prompt-based methods, which utilize large language models (LLMs) for instruction-based task execution, and training-based methods, which fine-tune multimodal models for mobile-specific applications. Additionally, we explore complementary technologies that augment agent performance. By discussing key challenges and outlining future research directions, this survey offers valuable insights for advancing mobile agent technologies.

Abstract: The reward hypothesis states that all goals and purposes can be understood as the maximization of a received scalar reward signal. However, in practice, defining such a reward signal is notoriously difficult, as humans are often unable to predict the optimal behavior corresponding to a reward function. Natural language offers an intuitive alternative for instructing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, yet previous language-conditioned approaches either require costly supervision or test-time training given a language instruction. In this work, we present a new approach that uses a pretrained RL agent trained using only unlabeled, offline interactions--without task-specific supervision or labeled trajectories--to get zero-shot test-time policy inference from arbitrary natural language instructions. We introduce a framework comprising three steps: imagine, project, and imitate. First, the agent imagines a sequence of observations corresponding to the provided language description using video generative models. Next, these imagined observations are projected into the target environment domain. Finally, an agent pretrained in the target environment with unsupervised RL instantly imitates the projected observation sequence through a closed-form solution. To the best of our knowledge, our method, RLZero, is the first approach to show direct language-to-behavior generation abilities on a variety of tasks and environments without any in-domain supervision. We further show that components of RLZero can be used to generate policies zero-shot from cross-embodied videos, such as those available on YouTube, even for complex embodiments like humanoids.

Abstract: The Mutliagent Path Finding (MAPF) problem consists of identifying the trajectories that a set of agents should follow inside a given network in order to reach their desired destinations as soon as possible, but without colliding with each other. We aim to minimize the maximum time any agent takes to reach their goal, ensuring optimal path length. In this work, we complement a recent thread of results that aim to systematically study the algorithmic behavior of this problem, through the parameterized complexity point of view.
  First, we show that MAPF is NP-hard when the given network has a star-like topology (bounded vertex cover number) or is a tree with $11$ leaves. Both of these results fill important gaps in our understanding of the tractability of this problem that were left untreated in the recent work of [Fioravantes et al. Exact Algorithms and Lowerbounds for Multiagent Path Finding: Power of Treelike Topology. AAAI'24]. Nevertheless, our main contribution is an exact algorithm that scales well as the input grows (FPT) when the topology of the given network is highly centralized (bounded distance to clique). This parameter is significant as it mirrors real-world networks. In such environments, a bunch of central hubs (e.g., processing areas) are connected to only few peripheral nodes.

Abstract: Causal discovery is an imperative foundation for decision-making across domains, such as smart health, AI for drug discovery and AIOps. Traditional statistical causal discovery methods, while well-established, predominantly rely on observational data and often overlook the semantic cues inherent in cause-and-effect relationships. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in an affordable way of leveraging the semantic cues for knowledge-driven causal discovery, but the development of LLMs for causal discovery lags behind other areas, particularly in the exploration of multi-modal data. To bridge the gap, we introduce MATMCD, a multi-agent system powered by tool-augmented LLMs. MATMCD has two key agents: a Data Augmentation agent that retrieves and processes modality-augmented data, and a Causal Constraint agent that integrates multi-modal data for knowledge-driven reasoning. The proposed design of the inner-workings ensures successful cooperation of the agents. Our empirical study across seven datasets suggests the significant potential of multi-modality enhanced causal discovery.

<title>Principal-Agent Bandit Games with Self-Interested and Exploratory Learning Agents</title>

Abstract: We study the repeated principal-agent bandit game, where the principal indirectly interacts with the unknown environment by proposing incentives for the agent to play arms. Most existing work assumes the agent has full knowledge of the reward means and always behaves greedily, but in many online marketplaces, the agent needs to learn the unknown environment and sometimes explore. Motivated by such settings, we model a self-interested learning agent with exploration behaviors who iteratively updates reward estimates and either selects an arm that maximizes the estimated reward plus incentive or explores arbitrarily with a certain probability. As a warm-up, we first consider a self-interested learning agent without exploration. We propose algorithms for both i.i.d. and linear reward settings with bandit feedback in a finite horizon $T$, achieving regret bounds of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ and $\widetilde{O}( T^{2/3} )$, respectively. Specifically, these algorithms are established upon a novel elimination framework coupled with newly-developed search algorithms which accommodate the uncertainty arising from the learning behavior of the agent. We then extend the framework to handle the exploratory learning agent and develop an algorithm to achieve a $\widetilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret bound in i.i.d. reward setup by enhancing the robustness of our elimination framework to the potential agent exploration. Finally, when reducing our agent behaviors to the one studied in (Dogan et al., 2023a), we propose an algorithm based on our robust framework, which achieves a $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, significantly improving upon their $\widetilde{O}(T^{11/12})$ bound.

Abstract: Distributed aggregative optimization methods are gaining increased traction due to their ability to address cooperative control and optimization problems, where the objective function of each agent depends not only on its own decision variable but also on the aggregation of other agents' decision variables. Nevertheless, existing distributed aggregative optimization methods implicitly assume all agents to be truthful in information sharing, which can be unrealistic in real-world scenarios, where agents may act selfishly or strategically. In fact, an opportunistic agent may deceptively share false information in its own favor to minimize its own loss, which, however, will compromise the network-level global performance. To solve this issue, we propose a new distributed aggregative optimization algorithm that can ensure truthfulness of agents and convergence performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that ensures truthfulness in a fully distributed setting, where no "centralized" aggregator exists to collect private information/decision variables from participating agents. We systematically characterize the convergence rate of our algorithm under nonconvex/convex/strongly convex objective functions, which generalizes existing distributed aggregative optimization results that only focus on convex objective functions. We also rigorously quantify the tradeoff between convergence performance and the level of enabled truthfulness under different convexity conditions. Numerical simulations using distributed charging of electric vehicles confirm the efficacy of our algorithm.

Abstract: We present an approach to model-based RL that achieves a new state of the art performance on the challenging Craftax-classic benchmark, an open-world 2D survival game that requires agents to exhibit a wide range of general abilities -- such as strong generalization, deep exploration, and long-term reasoning. With a series of careful design choices aimed at improving sample efficiency, our MBRL algorithm achieves a reward of 69.66% after only 1M environment steps, significantly outperforming DreamerV3, which achieves 53.2%, and, for the first time, exceeds human performance of 65.0%. Our method starts by constructing a SOTA model-free baseline, using a novel policy architecture that combines CNNs and RNNs. We then add three improvements to the standard MBRL setup: (a) "Dyna with warmup", which trains the policy on real and imaginary data, (b) "nearest neighbor tokenizer" on image patches, which improves the scheme to create the transformer world model (TWM) inputs, and (c) "block teacher forcing", which allows the TWM to reason jointly about the future tokens of the next timestep.

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of coexistence for embodied artificial agents and argues that it is a prerequisite for long-term, in-the-wild interaction with humans. Contemporary embodied artificial agents excel in static, predefined tasks but fall short in dynamic and long-term interactions with humans. On the other hand, humans can adapt and evolve continuously, exploiting the situated knowledge embedded in their environment and other agents, thus contributing to meaningful interactions. We take an interdisciplinary approach at different levels of organization, drawing from biology and design theory, to understand how human and non-human organisms foster entities that coexist within their specific environments. Finally, we propose key research directions for the artificial intelligence community to develop coexisting embodied agents, focusing on the principles, hardware and learning methods responsible for shaping them.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large models, driven by their exceptional abilities in learning and generalization through large-scale pre-training, has reshaped the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for Human-AI Teaming and Zero-shot Cooperation focus on task completion, i.e., task rewards, as the sole evaluation metric while being agnostic to how the two agents work with each other. Furthermore, subjective user studies only offer limited insight into the quality of cooperation existing within the team. Specifically, we are interested in understanding the cooperative behaviors arising within the team when trained agents are paired with humans -- a problem that has been overlooked by the existing literature. To formally address this problem, we propose the concept of constructive interdependence -- measuring how much agents rely on each other's actions to achieve the shared goal -- as a key metric for evaluating cooperation in human-agent teams. We interpret interdependence in terms of action interactions in a STRIPS formalism, and define metrics that allow us to assess the degree of reliance between the agents' actions. We pair state-of-the-art agents HAT with learned human models as well as human participants in a user study for the popular Overcooked domain, and evaluate the task reward and teaming performance for these human-agent teams. Our results demonstrate that although trained agents attain high task rewards, they fail to induce cooperative behavior, showing very low levels of interdependence across teams. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that teaming performance is not necessarily correlated with task reward, highlighting that task reward alone cannot reliably measure cooperation arising in a team.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations and outdated knowledge due to their reliance on static training data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by integrating external dynamic information for improved factual grounding. With advances in multimodal learning, Multimodal RAG extends this approach by incorporating multiple modalities such as text, images, audio, and video to enhance the generated outputs. However, cross-modal alignment and reasoning introduce unique challenges beyond those in unimodal RAG. This survey offers a structured and comprehensive analysis of Multimodal RAG systems, covering datasets, benchmarks, metrics, evaluation, methodologies, and innovations in retrieval, fusion, augmentation, and generation.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown great promise for knowledge-intensive tasks and recently advanced with agentic RAG, where language agents engage in multi-round interactions with external knowledge sources for adaptive information retrieval. However, existing agentic RAG methods often depend on ad-hoc prompt engineering and lack a unified optimization framework. We introduce RAG-Gym, a comprehensive platform that systematically explores three optimization dimensions: (1) prompt engineering, (2) actor tuning, and (3) critic training. For prompt engineering, we propose Re$^2$Search, a novel agent incorporating reasoning reflection that significantly outperforms standard prompts. In actor tuning, we evaluate three popular post-training algorithms with fine-grained process supervision and identify direct preference optimization as the most effective. We further demonstrate that a trained critic can enhance inference by selecting higher-quality intermediate reasoning steps. Together, these findings lead to the optimized Re$^2$Search++ agent, which surpasses most recent methods like Search-R1 by a relative increase of 3.2% to 11.6% in average F1. Finally, we examine the impact of different reward sources and analyze scaling properties in training and inference, offering practical insights for agentic RAG optimization.

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have revolutionized complex problem-solving capability by enabling sophisticated agent collaboration through message-based communications. While the communication framework is crucial for agent coordination, it also introduces a critical yet unexplored security vulnerability. In this work, we introduce Agent-in-the-Middle (AiTM), a novel attack that exploits the fundamental communication mechanisms in LLM-MAS by intercepting and manipulating inter-agent messages. Unlike existing attacks that compromise individual agents, AiTM demonstrates how an adversary can compromise entire multi-agent systems by only manipulating the messages passing between agents. To enable the attack under the challenges of limited control and role-restricted communication format, we develop an LLM-powered adversarial agent with a reflection mechanism that generates contextually-aware malicious instructions. Our comprehensive evaluation across various frameworks, communication structures, and real-world applications demonstrates that LLM-MAS is vulnerable to communication-based attacks, highlighting the need for robust security measures in multi-agent systems.

<title>IMPROVE: Iterative Model Pipeline Refinement and Optimization Leveraging LLM Experts</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as a promising solution to automate the workflow of machine learning, but most existing methods share a common limitation: they attempt to optimize entire pipelines in a single step before evaluation, making it difficult to attribute improvements to specific changes. This lack of granularity leads to unstable optimization and slower convergence, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we introduce Iterative Refinement, a novel strategy for LLM-driven ML pipeline design inspired by how human ML experts iteratively refine models, focusing on one component at a time rather than making sweeping changes all at once. By systematically updating individual components based on real training feedback, Iterative Refinement improves overall model performance. We also provide some theoretical edvience of the superior properties of this Iterative Refinement. Further, we implement this strategy in IMPROVE, an end-to-end LLM agent framework for automating and optimizing object classification pipelines. Through extensive evaluations across datasets of varying sizes and domains, we demonstrate that Iterative Refinement enables IMPROVE to consistently achieve better performance over existing zero-shot LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Recently, LLM agents have made rapid progress in improving their programming capabilities. However, existing benchmarks lack the ability to automatically evaluate from users' perspective, and also lack the explainability of the results of LLM agents' code generation capabilities. Thus, we introduce ProjectEval, a new benchmark for LLM agents project-level code generation's automated evaluation by simulating user interaction. ProjectEval is constructed by LLM with human reviewing. It has three different level inputs of natural languages or code skeletons. ProjectEval can evaluate the generated projects by user interaction simulation for execution, and by code similarity through existing objective indicators. Through ProjectEval, we find that systematic engineering project code, overall understanding of the project and comprehensive analysis capability are the keys for LLM agents to achieve practical projects. Our findings and benchmark provide valuable insights for developing more effective programming agents that can be deployed in future real-world production.

<title>Prioritized Planning for Continuous-time Lifelong Multi-agent Pathfinding</title>

Abstract: Multi-agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning collision-free movements of agents so that they get from where they are to where they need to be. Commonly, agents are located on a graph and can traverse edges. This problem has many variations and has been studied for decades. Two such variations are the continuous-time and the lifelong MAPF problems. In the former, edges have non-unit lengths and volumetric agents can traverse them at any real-valued time. In the latter, agents must attend to a continuous stream of incoming tasks. Much work has been devoted to designing solution methods within these two areas. To our knowledge, however, the combined problem of continuous-time lifelong MAPF has yet to be addressed. This work addresses continuous-time lifelong MAPF with volumetric agents by presenting the fast and sub-optimal Continuous-time Prioritized Lifelong Planner (CPLP). CPLP continuously assigns agents to tasks and computes plans using a combination of two path planners; one based on CCBS and the other based on SIPP. Experimental results with up to 800 agents on graphs with up to 12 000 vertices demonstrate practical performance, where maximum planning times fall within the available time budget. Additionally, CPLP ensures collision-free movement even when failing to meet this budget. Therefore, the robustness of CPLP highlights its potential for real-world applications.

<title>Time- and Space-Optimal Silent Self-Stabilizing Exact Majority in Population Protocols</title>

Abstract: We address the self-stabilizing exact majority problem in the population protocol model, introduced by Angluin, Aspnes, Diamadi, Fischer, and Peralta (2004). In this model, there are $n$ state machines, called agents, which form a network. At each time step, only two agents interact with each other, and update their states. In the self-stabilizing exact majority problem, each agent has a fixed opinion, $\mathtt{A}$ or $\mathtt{B}$, and stabilizes to a safe configuration in which all agents output the majority opinion from any initial configuration.
  In this paper, we show the impossibility of solving the self-stabilizing exact majority problem without knowledge of $n$ in any protocol. We propose a silent self-stabilizing exact majority protocol, which stabilizes within $O(n)$ parallel time in expectation and within $O(n \log n)$ parallel time with high probability, using $O(n)$ states, with knowledge of $n$. Here, a silent protocol means that, after stabilization, the state of each agent does not change. We establish lower bounds, proving that any silent protocol requires $\Omega(n)$ states, $\Omega(n)$ parallel time in expectation, and $\Omega(n \log n)$ parallel time with high probability to reach a safe configuration. Thus, the proposed protocol is time- and space-optimal.

Abstract: World models aim to learn action-controlled future prediction and have proven essential for the development of intelligent agents. However, most existing world models rely heavily on substantial action-labeled data and costly training, making it challenging to adapt to novel environments with heterogeneous actions through limited interactions. This limitation can hinder their applicability across broader domains. To overcome this limitation, we propose AdaWorld, an innovative world model learning approach that enables efficient adaptation. The key idea is to incorporate action information during the pretraining of world models. This is achieved by extracting latent actions from videos in a self-supervised manner, capturing the most critical transitions between frames. We then develop an autoregressive world model that conditions on these latent actions. This learning paradigm enables highly adaptable world models, facilitating efficient transfer and learning of new actions even with limited interactions and finetuning. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple environments demonstrate that AdaWorld achieves superior performance in both simulation quality and visual planning.

<title>Understanding Inequality of LLM Fact-Checking over Geographic Regions with Agent and Retrieval models</title>

Abstract: Fact-checking is a potentially useful application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to combat the growing dissemination of disinformation. However, the performance of LLMs varies across geographic regions. In this paper, we evaluate the factual accuracy of open and private models across a diverse set of regions and scenarios.
  Using a dataset containing 600 fact-checked statements balanced across six global regions we examine three experimental setups of fact-checking a statement: (1) when just the statement is available, (2) when an LLM-based agent with Wikipedia access is utilized, and (3) as a best case scenario when a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system provided with the official fact check is employed. Our findings reveal that regardless of the scenario and LLM used, including GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, and LLaMA, statements from the Global North perform substantially better than those from the Global South. Furthermore, this gap is broadened for the more realistic case of a Wikipedia agent-based system, highlighting that overly general knowledge bases have a limited ability to address region-specific nuances. These results underscore the urgent need for better dataset balancing and robust retrieval strategies to enhance LLM fact-checking capabilities, particularly in geographically diverse contexts.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has made remarkable progress, yet existing systems still lack intuitive control over spatial composition, object consistency, and multi-step editing. We present $\textbf{LayerCraft}$, a modular framework that uses large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents to orchestrate structured, layered image generation and editing. LayerCraft supports two key capabilities: (1) $\textit{structured generation}$ from simple prompts via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, enabling it to decompose scenes, reason about object placement, and guide composition in a controllable, interpretable manner; and (2) $\textit{layered object integration}$, allowing users to insert and customize objects -- such as characters or props -- across diverse images or scenes while preserving identity, context, and style. The system comprises a coordinator agent, the $\textbf{ChainArchitect}$ for CoT-driven layout planning, and the $\textbf{Object Integration Network (OIN)}$ for seamless image editing using off-the-shelf T2I models without retraining. Through applications like batch collage editing and narrative scene generation, LayerCraft empowers non-experts to iteratively design, customize, and refine visual content with minimal manual effort. Code will be released at https://github.com/PeterYYZhang/LayerCraft.

Abstract: Artificial agents are increasingly central to complex interactions and decision-making tasks, yet aligning their behaviors with desired human values remains an open challenge. In this work, we investigate how human-like personality traits influence agent behavior and performance within text-based interactive environments. We introduce PANDA: Personality Adapted Neural Decision Agents, a novel method for projecting human personality traits onto agents to guide their behavior. To induce personality in a text-based game agent, (i) we train a personality classifier to identify what personality type the agent's actions exhibit, and (ii) we integrate the personality profiles directly into the agent's policy-learning pipeline. By deploying agents embodying 16 distinct personality types across 25 text-based games and analyzing their trajectories, we demonstrate that an agent's action decisions can be guided toward specific personality profiles. Moreover, certain personality types, such as those characterized by higher levels of Openness, display marked advantages in performance. These findings underscore the promise of personality-adapted agents for fostering more aligned, effective, and human-centric decision-making in interactive environments.

Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are being actively explored in medicine, their ability to conduct telemedicine consultations combining accurate diagnosis with professional dialogue remains underexplored. In this paper, we present 3MDBench (Medical Multimodal Multi-agent Dialogue Benchmark), an open-source framework for simulating and evaluating LVLM-driven telemedical consultations. 3MDBench simulates patient variability through four temperament-based Patient Agents and an Assessor Agent that jointly evaluate diagnostic accuracy and dialogue quality. It includes 3013 cases across 34 diagnoses drawn from real-world telemedicine interactions, combining textual and image-based data. The experimental study compares diagnostic strategies for popular LVLMs, including GPT-4o-mini, LLaVA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, and Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct. We demonstrate that multimodal dialogue with internal reasoning improves F1 score by 6.5% over non-dialogue settings, highlighting the importance of context-aware, information-seeking questioning. Moreover, injecting predictions from a diagnostic convolutional network into the LVLM's context boosts F1 by up to 20%.

Abstract: Systematic reviews (SRs) are vital for evidence-based practice in high stakes disciplines, such as healthcare, but are often impeded by intensive labors and lengthy processes that can take months to complete. Due to the high demand for domain expertise, existing automatic summarization methods fail to accurately identify relevant studies and generate high-quality summaries. To that end, we introduce InsightAgent, a human-centered interactive AI agent powered by large language models that revolutionize this workflow. InsightAgent partitions a large literature corpus based on semantics and employs a multi-agent design for more focused processing of literature, leading to significant improvement in the quality of generated SRs. InsightAgent also provides intuitive visualizations of the corpus and agent trajectories, allowing users to effortlessly monitor the actions of the agent and provide real-time feedback based on their expertise. Our user studies with 9 medical professionals demonstrate that the visualization and interaction mechanisms can effectively improve the quality of synthesized SRs by 27.2%, reaching 79.7% of human-written quality. At the same time, user satisfaction is improved by 34.4%. With InsightAgent, it only takes a clinician about 1.5 hours, rather than months, to complete a high-quality systematic review.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) augments large language models (LLMs) with the ability to invoke external tools during long-form reasoning, such as search engines and code interpreters, to solve tasks beyond the capabilities of internal reasoning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training such agents, most of existing approaches typically optimize only for final correctness without considering the efficiency or necessity of external tool use. This often leads to excessive tool calling, incurring high computational costs and hindering the development of internal reasoning capabilities - a phenomenon known as \textit{cognitive offloading}. To this end, we propose Optimal Tool Call-controlled Policy Optimization (OTC-PO), a simple yet effective RL-based framework that encourages models to produce accurate answers with minimal tool calls. Our method introduces a tool-integrated reward that jointly considers answer correctness and corresponding tool use behavior of model to reach that answer. To validate the effectiveness, we introduce the metric of \textit{tool productivity}, defined as the ratio between the number of correct answers and the total number of tool calls across all test cases. This metric reflects how efficiently tool usage contributes to successful task completion, with higher values indicating smarter and more autonomous reasoning. We instantiate this framework within both Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), resulting in OTC-PPO and OTC-GRPO. Experiments with Qwen-2.5 and Qwen-Math across multiple QA benchmarks show that our approach reduces tool calls by up to 68.3\% and improves tool productivity by up to 215.4\%, while maintaining comparable answer accuracy.

Abstract: Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) play a crucial role in maritime operations, yet their navigation in shallow-water environments remains challenging due to dynamic disturbances and depth constraints. Traditional navigation strategies struggle with limited sensor information, making safe and efficient operation difficult. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for ASV navigation under depth constraints, where the vehicle must reach a target while avoiding unsafe areas with only a single depth measurement per timestep from a downward-facing Single Beam Echosounder (SBES). To enhance environmental awareness, we integrate Gaussian Process (GP) regression into the RL framework, enabling the agent to progressively estimate a bathymetric depth map from sparse sonar readings. This approach improves decision-making by providing a richer representation of the environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate effective sim-to-real transfer, ensuring that trained policies generalize well to real-world aquatic conditions. Experimental results validate our method's capability to improve ASV navigation performance while maintaining safety in challenging shallow-water environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces the HAIG framework for analysing trust dynamics across evolving human-AI relationships. Current categorical frameworks (e.g., "human-in-the-loop" models) inadequately capture how AI systems evolve from tools to partners, particularly as foundation models demonstrate emergent capabilities and multi-agent systems exhibit autonomous goal-setting behaviours. As systems advance, agency redistributes in complex patterns that are better represented as positions along continua rather than discrete categories, though progression may include both gradual shifts and significant step changes. The HAIG framework operates across three levels: dimensions (Decision Authority Distribution, Process Autonomy, and Accountability Configuration), continua (gradual shifts along each dimension), and thresholds (critical points requiring governance adaptation). Unlike risk-based or principle-based approaches, HAIG adopts a trust-utility orientation, focusing on maintaining appropriate trust relationships that maximise utility while ensuring sufficient safeguards. Our analysis reveals how technical advances in self-supervision, reasoning authority, and distributed decision-making drive non-uniform trust evolution across both contextual variation and technological advancement. Case studies in healthcare and European regulation demonstrate how HAIG complements existing frameworks while offering a foundation for alternative approaches that anticipate governance challenges before they emerge.

<title>Strategy-Augmented Planning for Large Language Models via Opponent Exploitation</title>

Abstract: Efficiently modeling and exploiting opponents is a long-standing challenge in adversarial domains. Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive textual data have recently demonstrated outstanding performance in general tasks, introducing new research directions for opponent modeling. Some studies primarily focus on directly using LLMs to generate decisions based on the elaborate prompt context that incorporates opponent descriptions, while these approaches are limited to scenarios where LLMs possess adequate domain expertise. To address that, we introduce a two-stage Strategy-Augmented Planning (SAP) framework that significantly enhances the opponent exploitation capabilities of LLM-based agents by utilizing a critical component, the Strategy Evaluation Network (SEN). Specifically, in the offline stage, we construct an explicit strategy space and subsequently collect strategy-outcome pair data for training the SEN network. During the online phase, SAP dynamically recognizes the opponent's strategies and greedily exploits them by searching best response strategy on the well-trained SEN, finally translating strategy to a course of actions by carefully designed prompts. Experimental results show that SAP exhibits robust generalization capabilities, allowing it to perform effectively not only against previously encountered opponent strategies but also against novel, unseen strategies. In the MicroRTS environment, SAP achieves a $85.35\%$ performance improvement over baseline methods and matches the competitiveness of reinforcement learning approaches against state-of-the-art (SOTA) rule-based AI. Our code is available at https://github.com/hsushuai/SAP.

Abstract: Macroeconomic outcomes emerge from individuals' decisions, making it essential to model how agents interact with macro policy via consumption, investment, and labor choices. We formulate this as a dynamic Stackelberg game: the government (leader) sets policies, and agents (followers) respond by optimizing their behavior over time. Unlike static models, this dynamic formulation captures temporal dependencies and strategic feedback critical to policy design. However, as the number of agents increases, explicitly simulating all agent-agent and agent-government interactions becomes computationally infeasible. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Stackelberg Mean Field Game (DSMFG) framework, which approximates these complex interactions via agent-population and government-population couplings. This approximation preserves individual-level feedback while ensuring scalability, enabling DSMFG to jointly model three core features of real-world policymaking: dynamic feedback, asymmetry, and large scale. We further introduce Stackelberg Mean Field Reinforcement Learning (SMFRL), a data-driven algorithm that learns the leader's optimal policies while maintaining personalized responses for individual agents. Empirically, we validate our approach in a large-scale simulated economy, where it scales to 1,000 agents (vs. 100 in prior work) and achieves a fourfold increase in GDP over classical economic methods and a nineteenfold improvement over the static 2022 U.S. federal income tax policy.

<title>When LLMs Play the Telephone Game: Cultural Attractors as Conceptual Tools to Evaluate LLMs in Multi-turn Settings</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and generating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better understand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the next. While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors, existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases, negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity, difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger attractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics.

<title>Standard Benchmarks Fail - Auditing LLM Agents in Finance Must Prioritize Risk</title>

Abstract: Standard benchmarks fixate on how well large language model (LLM) agents perform in finance, yet say little about whether they are safe to deploy. We argue that accuracy metrics and return-based scores provide an illusion of reliability, overlooking vulnerabilities such as hallucinated facts, stale data, and adversarial prompt manipulation. We take a firm position: financial LLM agents should be evaluated first and foremost on their risk profile, not on their point-estimate performance. Drawing on risk-engineering principles, we outline a three-level agenda: model, workflow, and system, for stress-testing LLM agents under realistic failure modes. To illustrate why this shift is urgent, we audit six API-based and open-weights LLM agents on three high-impact tasks and uncover hidden weaknesses that conventional benchmarks miss. We conclude with actionable recommendations for researchers, practitioners, and regulators: audit risk-aware metrics in future studies, publish stress scenarios alongside datasets, and treat ``safety budget'' as a primary success criterion. Only by redefining what ``good'' looks like can the community responsibly advance AI-driven finance.

Abstract: The high-order complexity of human behaviour is likely the root cause of extreme difficulty in financial market projections. We consider that behavioural simulation can unveil systemic dynamics to support analysis. Simulating diverse human groups must account for the behavioural heterogeneity, especially in finance. To address the fidelity of simulated agents, on the basis of agent-based modeling, we propose a new paradigm of behavioural simulation where each agent is supported and driven by a hierarchical knowledge architecture. This architecture, integrating language and professional models, imitates behavioural processes in specific scenarios. Evaluated on futures markets, our simulator achieves a 13.29% deviation in simulating crisis scenarios whose price increase rate reaches 285.34%. Under normal conditions, our simulator also exhibits lower mean square error in predicting futures price of specific commodities. This technique bridges non-quantitative information with diverse market behaviour, offering a promising platform to simulate investor behaviour and its impact on market dynamics.

Abstract: Longitudinal engagement with generative AI (GenAI) storytelling agents is a timely but less charted domain. We explored multi-generational experiences with "Dreamsmithy," a daily dream-crafting app, where participants (N = 28) co-created stories with AI narrator "Makoto" every day. Reflections and interactions were captured through a two-week diary study. Reflexive thematic analysis revealed themes likes "oscillating ambivalence" and "socio-chronological bonding," highlighting the complex dynamics that emerged between individuals and the AI narrator over time. Findings suggest that while people appreciated the personal notes, opportunities for reflection, and AI creativity, limitations in narrative coherence and control occasionally caused frustration. The results underscore the potential of GenAI for longitudinal storytelling, but also raise critical questions about user agency and ethics. We contribute initial empirical insights and design considerations for developing adaptive, more-than-human storytelling systems.

Abstract: We are living in an era of "big literature", where the volume of digital scientific publications is growing exponentially. While offering new opportunities, this also poses challenges for understanding literature landscapes, as traditional manual reviewing is no longer feasible. Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities for literature comprehension, yet they are incapable of offering "comprehensive, objective, open and transparent" views desired by systematic reviews due to their limited context windows and trust issues like hallucinations. Here we present LitChat, an end-to-end, interactive and conversational literature agent that augments LLM agents with data-driven discovery tools to facilitate literature exploration. LitChat automatically interprets user queries, retrieves relevant sources, constructs knowledge graphs, and employs diverse data-mining techniques to generate evidence-based insights addressing user needs. We illustrate the effectiveness of LitChat via a case study on AI4Health, highlighting its capacity to quickly navigate the users through large-scale literature landscape with data-based evidence that is otherwise infeasible with traditional means.

<title>Zero-Trust Foundation Models: A New Paradigm for Secure and Collaborative Artificial Intelligence for Internet of Things</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23792</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on Zero-Trust Foundation Models (ZTFMs), a novel paradigm that embeds zero-trust security principles into the lifecycle of foundation models (FMs) for Internet of Things (IoT) systems. By integrating core tenets, such as continuous verification, least privilege access (LPA), data confidentiality, and behavioral analytics into the design, training, and deployment of FMs, ZTFMs can enable secure, privacy-preserving AI across distributed, heterogeneous, and potentially adversarial IoT environments. We present the first structured synthesis of ZTFMs, identifying their potential to transform conventional trust-based IoT architectures into resilient, self-defending ecosystems. Moreover, we propose a comprehensive technical framework, incorporating federated learning (FL), blockchain-based identity management, micro-segmentation, and trusted execution environments (TEEs) to support decentralized, verifiable intelligence at the network edge. In addition, we investigate emerging security threats unique to ZTFM-enabled systems and evaluate countermeasures, such as anomaly detection, adversarial training, and secure aggregation. Through this analysis, we highlight key open research challenges in terms of scalability, secure orchestration, interpretable threat attribution, and dynamic trust calibration. This survey lays a foundational roadmap for secure, intelligent, and trustworthy IoT infrastructures powered by FMs.

<title>MultiPhishGuard: An LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Phishing Email Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23803</link>

Abstract: Phishing email detection faces critical challenges from evolving adversarial tactics and heterogeneous attack patterns. Traditional detection methods, such as rule-based filters and denylists, often struggle to keep pace with these evolving tactics, leading to false negatives and compromised security. While machine learning approaches have improved detection accuracy, they still face challenges adapting to novel phishing strategies. We present MultiPhishGuard, a dynamic LLM-based multi-agent detection system that synergizes specialized expertise with adversarial-aware reinforcement learning. Our framework employs five cooperative agents (text, URL, metadata, explanation simplifier, and adversarial agents) with automatically adjusted decision weights powered by a Proximal Policy Optimization reinforcement learning algorithm. To address emerging threats, we introduce an adversarial training loop featuring an adversarial agent that generates subtle context-aware email variants, creating a self-improving defense ecosystem and enhancing system robustness. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that MultiPhishGuard significantly outperforms Chain-of-Thoughts, single-agent baselines and state-of-the-art detectors, as validated by ablation studies and comparative analyses. Experiments demonstrate that MultiPhishGuard achieves high accuracy (97.89\%) with low false positive (2.73\%) and false negative rates (0.20\%). Additionally, we incorporate an explanation simplifier agent, which provides users with clear and easily understandable explanations for why an email is classified as phishing or legitimate. This work advances phishing defense through dynamic multi-agent collaboration and generative adversarial resilience.

<title>ADA: Automated Moving Target Defense for AI Workloads via Ephemeral Infrastructure-Native Rotation in Kubernetes</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23805</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Adaptive Defense Agent (ADA), an innovative Automated Moving Target Defense (AMTD) system designed to fundamentally enhance the security posture of AI workloads. ADA operates by continuously and automatically rotating these workloads at the infrastructure level, leveraging the inherent ephemerality of Kubernetes pods. This constant managed churn systematically invalidates attacker assumptions and disrupts potential kill chains by regularly destroying and respawning AI service instances. This methodology, applying principles of chaos engineering as a continuous, proactive defense, offers a paradigm shift from traditional static defenses that rely on complex and expensive confidential or trusted computing solutions to secure the underlying compute platforms, while at the same time agnostically supporting the latest advancements in agentic and nonagentic AI ecosystems and solutions such as agent-to-agent (A2A) communication frameworks or model context protocols (MCP). This AI-native infrastructure design, relying on the widely proliferated cloud-native Kubernetes technologies, facilitates easier deployment, simplifies maintenance through an inherent zero trust posture achieved by rotation, and promotes faster adoption. We posit that ADA's novel approach to AMTD provides a more robust, agile, and operationally efficient zero-trust model for AI services, achieving security through proactive environmental manipulation rather than reactive patching.

<title>Aligning LLMs by Predicting Preferences from User Writing Samples</title>

Abstract: Accommodating human preferences is essential for creating aligned LLM agents that deliver personalized and effective interactions. Recent work has shown the potential for LLMs acting as writing agents to infer a description of user preferences. Agent alignment then comes from conditioning on the inferred preference description. However, existing methods often produce generic preference descriptions that fail to capture the unique and individualized nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PROSE, a method designed to enhance the precision of preference descriptions inferred from user writing samples. PROSE incorporates two key elements: (1) iterative refinement of inferred preferences, and (2) verification of inferred preferences across multiple user writing samples. We evaluate PROSE with several LLMs (i.e., Qwen2.5 7B and 72B Instruct, GPT-mini, and GPT-4o) on a summarization and an email writing task. We find that PROSE more accurately infers nuanced human preferences, improving the quality of the writing agent's generations over CIPHER (a state-of-the-art method for inferring preferences) by 33\%. Lastly, we demonstrate that ICL and PROSE are complementary methods, and combining them provides up to a 9\% improvement over ICL alone.

Abstract: We investigate a new form of (privacy-preserving) inconsistency measurement for multi-party communication. Intuitively, for two knowledge bases K_A, K_B (of two agents A, B), our results allow to quantitatively assess the degree of inconsistency for K_A U K_B without having to reveal the actual contents of the knowledge bases. Using secure multi-party computation (SMPC) and cryptographic protocols, we develop two concrete methods for this use-case and show that they satisfy important properties of SMPC protocols -- notably, input privacy, i.e., jointly computing the inconsistency degree without revealing the inputs.

<title>Benchmarking Abstract and Reasoning Abilities Through A Theoretical Perspective</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to establish a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded benchmark for rigorously probing abstract reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). To achieve this, we first develop a mathematic framework that defines abstract reasoning as the ability to: (i) extract essential patterns independent of surface representations, and (ii) apply consistent rules to these abstract patterns. Based on this framework, we introduce two novel complementary metrics: \(\scoreGamma\) measures basic reasoning accuracy, while \(\scoreDelta\) quantifies a model's reliance on specific symbols rather than underlying patterns - a key indicator of true abstraction versus mere memorization. To implement this measurement, we design a benchmark: systematic symbol remapping in rule-based tasks, which forces models to demonstrate genuine pattern recognition beyond superficial token matching. Extensive LLM evaluations using this benchmark (commercial API models, 7B-70B, multi-agent) reveal:1) critical limitations in non-decimal arithmetic and symbolic reasoning; 2) persistent abstraction gaps despite chain-of-thought prompting; and 3) \(\scoreDelta\)'s effectiveness in robustly measuring memory dependence by quantifying performance degradation under symbol remapping, particularly highlighting operand-specific memorization. These findings underscore that current LLMs, despite domain-specific strengths, still lack robust abstract reasoning, highlighting key areas for future improvement.

<title>Large Language Models Often Know When They Are Being Evaluated</title>

Abstract: If AI models can detect when they are being evaluated, the effectiveness of evaluations might be compromised. For example, models could have systematically different behavior during evaluations, leading to less reliable benchmarks for deployment and governance decisions. We investigate whether frontier language models can accurately classify transcripts based on whether they originate from evaluations or real-world deployment, a capability we call evaluation awareness. To achieve this, we construct a diverse benchmark of 1,000 prompts and transcripts from 61 distinct datasets. These span public benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, SWEBench), real-world deployment interactions, and agent trajectories from scaffolding frameworks (e.g., web-browsing agents). Frontier models clearly demonstrate above-random evaluation awareness (Gemini-2.5-Pro reaches an AUC of $0.83$), but do not yet surpass our simple human baseline (AUC of $0.92$). Furthermore, both AI models and humans are better at identifying evaluations in agentic settings compared to chat settings. Additionally, we test whether models can identify the purpose of the evaluation. Under multiple-choice and open-ended questioning, AI models far outperform random chance in identifying what an evaluation is testing for. Our results indicate that frontier models already exhibit a substantial, though not yet superhuman, level of evaluation-awareness. We recommend tracking this capability in future models.

<title>CoMaPOI: A Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction Bridging the Gap Between Trajectory and Language</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23837</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for the next Point-Of-Interest (POI) prediction task, leveraging their capabilities in semantic understanding of POI trajectories. However, previous LLM-based methods, which are superficially adapted to next POI prediction, largely overlook critical challenges associated with applying LLMs to this task. Specifically, LLMs encounter two critical challenges: (1) a lack of intrinsic understanding of numeric spatiotemporal data, which hinders accurate modeling of users' spatiotemporal distributions and preferences; and (2) an excessively large and unconstrained candidate POI space, which often results in random or irrelevant predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Collaborative Multi Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction, named CoMaPOI. Through the close interaction of three specialized agents (Profiler, Forecaster, and Predictor), CoMaPOI collaboratively addresses the two critical challenges. The Profiler agent is responsible for converting numeric data into language descriptions, enhancing semantic understanding. The Forecaster agent focuses on dynamically constraining and refining the candidate POI space. The Predictor agent integrates this information to generate high-precision predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (NYC, TKY, and CA) demonstrate that CoMaPOI achieves state of the art performance, improving all metrics by 5% to 10% compared to SOTA baselines. This work pioneers the investigation of challenges associated with applying LLMs to complex spatiotemporal tasks by leveraging tailored collaborative agents.

<title>GeneBreaker: Jailbreak Attacks against DNA Language Models with Pathogenicity Guidance</title>

Abstract: DNA, encoding genetic instructions for almost all living organisms, fuels groundbreaking advances in genomics and synthetic biology. Recently, DNA Foundation Models have achieved success in designing synthetic functional DNA sequences, even whole genomes, but their susceptibility to jailbreaking remains underexplored, leading to potential concern of generating harmful sequences such as pathogens or toxin-producing genes. In this paper, we introduce GeneBreaker, the first framework to systematically evaluate jailbreak vulnerabilities of DNA foundation models. GeneBreaker employs (1) an LLM agent with customized bioinformatic tools to design high-homology, non-pathogenic jailbreaking prompts, (2) beam search guided by PathoLM and log-probability heuristics to steer generation toward pathogen-like sequences, and (3) a BLAST-based evaluation pipeline against a curated Human Pathogen Database (JailbreakDNABench) to detect successful jailbreaks. Evaluated on our JailbreakDNABench, GeneBreaker successfully jailbreaks the latest Evo series models across 6 viral categories consistently (up to 60\% Attack Success Rate for Evo2-40B). Further case studies on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and HIV-1 envelope protein demonstrate the sequence and structural fidelity of jailbreak output, while evolutionary modeling of SARS-CoV-2 underscores biosecurity risks. Our findings also reveal that scaling DNA foundation models amplifies dual-use risks, motivating enhanced safety alignment and tracing mechanisms. Our code is at https://github.com/zaixizhang/GeneBreaker.

Abstract: To fully leverage the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in a trustworthy manner, it is desirable to couple multiple AI and non-AI systems together seamlessly for constraining and ensuring correctness of the output. This paper introduces a novel parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) based methodology to combine multiple AI and non-AI agents in a causal, rule-based way. Our approach tightly integrates the concept of passage of time, with each agent considered as an entity in the PDES framework and responding to prior requests from other agents. Such coupling mechanism enables the agents to work in a co-operative environment towards a common goal while many tasks run in parallel throughout the simulation. It further enables setting up boundaries to the outputs of the AI agents by applying necessary dynamic constraints using non-AI agents while allowing for scalability through deployment of hundreds of such agents in a larger compute cluster. Distributing smaller AI agents can enable extremely scalable simulations in the future, addressing local memory bottlenecks for model parameter storage. Within a PDES involving both AI and non-AI agents, we break down the problem at hand into structured steps, when necessary, providing a set of multiple choices to the AI agents, and then progressively solve these steps towards a final goal. At each step, the non-AI agents act as unbiased auditors, verifying each action by the AI agents so that certain rules of engagement are followed. We evaluate our approach by solving four problems from four different domains and comparing the results with those from AI models alone. Our results show greater accuracy in solving problems from various domains where the AI models struggle to solve the problems solely by themselves. Results show that overall accuracy of our approach is 68% where as the accuracy of vanilla models is less than 23%.

<title>Seven Security Challenges That Must be Solved in Cross-domain Multi-agent LLM Systems</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving into autonomous agents that cooperate across organizational boundaries, enabling joint disaster response, supply-chain optimization, and other tasks that demand decentralized expertise without surrendering data ownership. Yet, cross-domain collaboration shatters the unified trust assumptions behind current alignment and containment techniques. An agent benign in isolation may, when receiving messages from an untrusted peer, leak secrets or violate policy, producing risks driven by emergent multi-agent dynamics rather than classical software bugs. This position paper maps the security agenda for cross-domain multi-agent LLM systems. We introduce seven categories of novel security challenges, for each of which we also present plausible attacks, security evaluation metrics, and future research guidelines.

<title>Large Language Model-Based Agents for Automated Research Reproducibility: An Exploratory Study in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23852</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23852</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To demonstrate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents to reproduce findings of published research studies using the same or similar dataset.
  Materials and Methods: We used the "Quick Access" dataset of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). We identified highly cited published research manuscripts using NACC data and selected five studies that appeared reproducible using this dataset alone. Using GPT-4o, we created a simulated research team of LLM-based autonomous agents tasked with writing and executing code to dynamically reproduce the findings of each study, given only study Abstracts, Methods sections, and data dictionary descriptions of the dataset.
  Results: We extracted 35 key findings described in the Abstracts across 5 Alzheimer's studies. On average, LLM agents approximately reproduced 53.2% of findings per study. Numeric values and range-based findings often differed between studies and agents. The agents also applied statistical methods or parameters that varied from the originals, though overall trends and significance were sometimes similar.
  Discussion: In some cases, LLM-based agents replicated research techniques and findings. In others, they failed due to implementation flaws or missing methodological detail. These discrepancies show the current limits of LLMs in fully automating reproducibility assessments. Still, this early investigation highlights the potential of structured agent-based systems to provide scalable evaluation of scientific rigor.
  Conclusion: This exploratory work illustrates both the promise and limitations of LLMs as autonomous agents for automating reproducibility in biomedical research.

arXiv:2505.23857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning in real-world applications often involves output-feedback settings, where the agent receives only partial state information. To address this challenge, we propose the Output-Feedback Markov Decision Process (OPMDP), which extends the standard MDP formulation to accommodate decision-making based on observation histories. Building on this framework, we introduce Depthwise Attention Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DATD3), a novel actor-critic algorithm that employs depthwise separable convolution and multi-head attention to encode historical observations. DATD3 maintains policy expressiveness while avoiding the instability of recurrent models. Extensive experiments on continuous control tasks demonstrate that DATD3 outperforms existing memory-based and recurrent baselines under both partial and full observability.

Abstract: Precision agriculture requires efficient autonomous systems for crop monitoring, where agents must explore large-scale environments while minimizing resource consumption. This work addresses the problem as an active exploration task in a grid environment representing an agricultural field. Each cell may contain targets (e.g., damaged crops) observable from nine predefined points of view (POVs). Agents must infer the number of targets per cell using partial, sequential observations.
  We propose a two-stage deep learning framework. A pre-trained LSTM serves as a belief model, updating a probabilistic map of the environment and its associated entropy, which defines the expected information gain (IG). This allows agents to prioritize informative regions. A key contribution is the inclusion of a POV visibility mask in the input, preserving the Markov property under partial observability and avoiding revisits to already explored views.
  Three agent architectures were compared: an untrained IG-based agent selecting actions to maximize entropy reduction; a DQN agent using CNNs over local 3x3 inputs with belief, entropy, and POV mask; and a Double-CNN DQN agent with wider spatial context. Simulations on 20x20 maps showed that the untrained agent performs well despite its simplicity. The DQN agent matches this performance when the POV mask is included, while the Double-CNN agent consistently achieves superior exploration efficiency, especially in larger environments.
  Results show that uncertainty-aware policies leveraging entropy, belief states, and visibility tracking lead to robust and scalable exploration. Future work includes curriculum learning, multi-agent cooperation with shared rewards, transformer-based models, and intrinsic motivation mechanisms to further enhance learning efficiency and policy generalization.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise for automating real-world tasks but struggle to transfer across domains due to their domain-specific nature. Current approaches face two critical shortcomings: they require complete architectural redesign and full retraining of all components when applied to new domains. We introduce Workforce, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decouples strategic planning from specialized execution through a modular architecture comprising: (i) a domain-agnostic Planner for task decomposition, (ii) a Coordinator for subtask management, and (iii) specialized Workers with domain-specific tool-calling capabilities. This decoupling enables cross-domain transferability during both inference and training phases: During inference, Workforce seamlessly adapts to new domains by adding or modifying worker agents; For training, we introduce Optimized Workforce Learning (OWL), which improves generalization across domains by optimizing a domain-agnostic planner with reinforcement learning from real-world feedback. To validate our approach, we evaluate Workforce on the GAIA benchmark, covering various realistic, multi-domain agentic tasks. Experimental results demonstrate Workforce achieves open-source state-of-the-art performance (69.70%), outperforming commercial systems like OpenAI's Deep Research by 2.34%. More notably, our OWL-trained 32B model achieves 52.73% accuracy (+16.37%) and demonstrates performance comparable to GPT-4o on challenging tasks. To summarize, by enabling scalable generalization and modular domain transfer, our work establishes a foundation for the next generation of general-purpose AI assistants.

<title>Lessons Learned: A Multi-Agent Framework for Code LLMs to Learn and Improve</title>

Abstract: Recent studies show that LLMs possess different skills and specialize in different tasks. In fact, we observe that their varied performance occur in several levels of granularity. For example, in the code optimization task, code LLMs excel at different optimization categories and no one dominates others. This observation prompts the question of how one leverages multiple LLM agents to solve a coding problem without knowing their complementary strengths a priori. We argue that a team of agents can learn from each other's successes and failures so as to improve their own performance. Thus, a lesson is the knowledge produced by an agent and passed on to other agents in the collective solution process. We propose a lesson-based collaboration framework, design the lesson solicitation--banking--selection mechanism, and demonstrate that a team of small LLMs with lessons learned can outperform a much larger LLM and other multi-LLM collaboration methods.

Abstract: As multimodal large models (MLLMs) continue to advance across challenging tasks, a key question emerges: What essential capabilities are still missing? A critical aspect of human learning is continuous interaction with the environment -- not limited to language, but also involving multimodal understanding and generation. To move closer to human-level intelligence, models must similarly support multi-turn, multimodal interaction. In particular, they should comprehend interleaved multimodal contexts and respond coherently in ongoing exchanges. In this work, we present an initial exploration through the InterMT -- the first preference dataset for multi-turn multimodal interaction, grounded in real human feedback. In this exploration, we particularly emphasize the importance of human oversight, introducing expert annotations to guide the process, motivated by the fact that current MLLMs lack such complex interactive capabilities. InterMT captures human preferences at both global and local levels into nine sub-dimensions, consists of 15.6k prompts, 52.6k multi-turn dialogue instances, and 32.4k human-labeled preference pairs. To compensate for the lack of capability for multi-modal understanding and generation, we introduce an agentic workflow that leverages tool-augmented MLLMs to construct multi-turn QA instances. To further this goal, we introduce InterMT-Bench to assess the ability of MLLMs in assisting judges with multi-turn, multimodal tasks. We demonstrate the utility of \InterMT through applications such as judge moderation and further reveal the multi-turn scaling law of judge model. We hope the open-source of our data can help facilitate further research on aligning current MLLMs to the next step. Our project website can be found at https://pku-intermt.github.io .

<title>Enhancing LLM-Based Code Generation with Complexity Metrics: A Feedback-Driven Approach</title>

Abstract: Automatic code generation has gained significant momentum with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Although many studies focus on improving the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation, very limited work tries to understand the generated code's characteristics and leverage that to improve failed cases. In this paper, as the most straightforward characteristic of code, we investigate the relationship between code complexity and the success of LLM generated code. Using a large set of standard complexity metrics, we first conduct an empirical analysis to explore their correlation with LLM's performance on code generation (i.e., Pass@1). Using logistic regression models, we identify which complexity metrics are most predictive of code correctness. Building on these findings, we propose an iterative feedback method, where LLMs are prompted to generate correct code based on complexity metrics from previous failed outputs. We validate our approach across multiple benchmarks (i.e., HumanEval, MBPP, LeetCode, and BigCodeBench) and various LLMs (i.e., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and GPT-o3 mini), comparing the results with two baseline methods: (a) zero-shot generation, and (b) iterative execution-based feedback without our code complexity insights. Experiment results show that our approach makes notable improvements, particularly with a smaller LLM (GPT3.5 Turbo), where, e.g., Pass@1 increased by 35.71% compared to the baseline's improvement of 12.5% on the HumanEval dataset. The study expands experiments to BigCodeBench and integrates the method with the Reflexion code generation agent, leading to Pass@1 improvements of 20% (GPT-4o) and 23.07% (GPT-o3 mini). The results highlight that complexity-aware feedback enhances both direct LLM prompting and agent-based workflows.

<title>Estimating Misreporting in the Presence of Genuine Modification: A Causal Perspective</title>

Abstract: In settings where ML models are used to inform the allocation of resources, agents affected by the allocation decisions might have an incentive to strategically change their features to secure better outcomes. While prior work has studied strategic responses broadly, disentangling misreporting from genuine modification remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we propose a causally-motivated approach to identify and quantify how much an agent misreports on average by distinguishing deceptive changes in their features from genuine modification. Our key insight is that, unlike genuine modification, misreported features do not causally affect downstream variables (i.e., causal descendants). We exploit this asymmetry by comparing the causal effect of misreported features on their causal descendants as derived from manipulated datasets against those from unmanipulated datasets. We formally prove identifiability of the misreporting rate and characterize the variance of our estimator. We empirically validate our theoretical results using a semi-synthetic and real Medicare dataset with misreported data, demonstrating that our approach can be employed to identify misreporting in real-world scenarios.

<title>Information Structure in Mappings: An Approach to Learning, Representation, and Generalisation</title>

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of large large-scale neural networks, we still lack unified notation for thinking about and describing their representational spaces. We lack methods to reliably describe how their representations are structured, how that structure emerges over training, and what kinds of structures are desirable. This thesis introduces quantitative methods for identifying systematic structure in a mapping between spaces, and leverages them to understand how deep-learning models learn to represent information, what representational structures drive generalisation, and how design decisions condition the structures that emerge. To do this I identify structural primitives present in a mapping, along with information theoretic quantifications of each. These allow us to analyse learning, structure, and generalisation across multi-agent reinforcement learning models, sequence-to-sequence models trained on a single task, and Large Language Models. I also introduce a novel, performant, approach to estimating the entropy of vector space, that allows this analysis to be applied to models ranging in size from 1 million to 12 billion parameters.
  The experiments here work to shed light on how large-scale distributed models of cognition learn, while allowing us to draw parallels between those systems and their human analogs. They show how the structures of language and the constraints that give rise to them in many ways parallel the kinds of structures that drive performance of contemporary neural networks.

<title>Multi-RAG: A Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation System for Adaptive Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: To effectively engage in human society, the ability to adapt, filter information, and make informed decisions in ever-changing situations is critical. As robots and intelligent agents become more integrated into human life, there is a growing opportunity-and need-to offload the cognitive burden on humans to these systems, particularly in dynamic, information-rich scenarios.
  To fill this critical need, we present Multi-RAG, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation system designed to provide adaptive assistance to humans in information-intensive circumstances. Our system aims to improve situational understanding and reduce cognitive load by integrating and reasoning over multi-source information streams, including video, audio, and text. As an enabling step toward long-term human-robot partnerships, Multi-RAG explores how multimodal information understanding can serve as a foundation for adaptive robotic assistance in dynamic, human-centered situations. To evaluate its capability in a realistic human-assistance proxy task, we benchmarked Multi-RAG on the MMBench-Video dataset, a challenging multimodal video understanding benchmark. Our system achieves superior performance compared to existing open-source video large language models (Video-LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs), while utilizing fewer resources and less input data. The results demonstrate Multi- RAG's potential as a practical and efficient foundation for future human-robot adaptive assistance systems in dynamic, real-world contexts.

Abstract: Group conversations are valuable for second language (L2) learners as they provide opportunities to practice listening and speaking, exercise complex turn-taking skills, and experience group social dynamics in a target language. However, most existing Augmented Reality (AR)-based conversational learning tools focus on dyadic interactions rather than group dialogues. Although research has shown that AR can help reduce speaking anxiety and create a comfortable space for practicing speaking skills in dyadic scenarios, especially with Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents, the potential for group language practice using these technologies remains largely unexplored. We introduce ConversAR, a gpt-4o powered AR application, that enables L2 learners to practice contextualized group conversations. Our system features two embodied LLM agents with vision-based scene understanding and live captions. In a system evaluation with 10 participants, users reported reduced speaking anxiety and increased learner autonomy compared to perceptions of in-person practice methods with other learners.

<title>LLM Agents Should Employ Security Principles</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show considerable promise for automating complex tasks using contextual reasoning; however, interactions involving multiple agents and the system's susceptibility to prompt injection and other forms of context manipulation introduce new vulnerabilities related to privacy leakage and system exploitation. This position paper argues that the well-established design principles in information security, which are commonly referred to as security principles, should be employed when deploying LLM agents at scale. Design principles such as defense-in-depth, least privilege, complete mediation, and psychological acceptability have helped guide the design of mechanisms for securing information systems over the last five decades, and we argue that their explicit and conscientious adoption will help secure agentic systems. To illustrate this approach, we introduce AgentSandbox, a conceptual framework embedding these security principles to provide safeguards throughout an agent's life-cycle. We evaluate with state-of-the-art LLMs along three dimensions: benign utility, attack utility, and attack success rate. AgentSandbox maintains high utility for its intended functions under both benign and adversarial evaluations while substantially mitigating privacy risks. By embedding secure design principles as foundational elements within emerging LLM agent protocols, we aim to promote trustworthy agent ecosystems aligned with user privacy expectations and evolving regulatory requirements.

<title>Measure gradients, not activations! Enhancing neuronal activity in deep reinforcement learning</title>

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents frequently suffer from neuronal activity loss, which impairs their ability to adapt to new data and learn continually. A common method to quantify and address this issue is the tau-dormant neuron ratio, which uses activation statistics to measure the expressive ability of neurons. While effective for simple MLP-based agents, this approach loses statistical power in more complex architectures. To address this, we argue that in advanced RL agents, maintaining a neuron's learning capacity, its ability to adapt via gradient updates, is more critical than preserving its expressive ability. Based on this insight, we shift the statistical objective from activations to gradients, and introduce GraMa (Gradient Magnitude Neural Activity Metric), a lightweight, architecture-agnostic metric for quantifying neuron-level learning capacity. We show that GraMa effectively reveals persistent neuron inactivity across diverse architectures, including residual networks, diffusion models, and agents with varied activation functions. Moreover, resetting neurons guided by GraMa (ReGraMa) consistently improves learning performance across multiple deep RL algorithms and benchmarks, such as MuJoCo and the DeepMind Control Suite.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, visual grounding, and complex reasoning. However, they remain limited by static training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims against up-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamic real-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to access large-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby grounding model outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in this paper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAG pipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on the modality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: on strategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrieved evidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to best integrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, we extend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and generation through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence and suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAG for LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performance boost of 5% without any fine-tuning.

<title>Deception in Oligopoly Games via Adaptive Nash Seeking Systems</title>

Abstract: In the theory of multi-agent systems, deception refers to the strategic manipulation of information to influence the behavior of other agents, ultimately altering the long-term dynamics of the entire system. Recently, this concept has been examined in the context of model-free Nash equilibrium seeking (NES) algorithms for noncooperative games. Specifically, it was demonstrated that players can exploit knowledge of other players' exploration signals to drive the system toward a ``deceptive" Nash equilibrium, while maintaining the stability of the closed-loop system. To extend this insight beyond the duopoly case, in this paper we conduct a comprehensive study of deception mechanisms in N-player oligopoly markets. By leveraging the structure of these games and employing stability techniques for nonlinear dynamical systems, we provide game-theoretic insights into deception and derive specialized results, including stability conditions. These results allow players to systematically adjust their NES dynamics by tuning gains and signal amplitudes, all while ensuring closed-loop stability. Additionally, we introduce novel sufficient conditions to demonstrate that the (practically) stable equilibrium point of the deceptive dynamics corresponds to a true Nash equilibrium of a different game, which we term the ``deceptive game." Our results show that, under the proposed adaptive dynamics with deception, a victim firm may develop a distorted perception of its competitors' product appeal, which could lead to setting suboptimal prices.

<title>Distributed Neural Policy Gradient Algorithm for Global Convergence of Networked Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: This paper studies the networked multi-agent reinforcement learning (NMARL) problem, where the objective of agents is to collaboratively maximize the discounted average cumulative rewards. Different from the existing methods that suffer from poor expression due to linear function approximation, we propose a distributed neural policy gradient algorithm that features two innovatively designed neural networks, specifically for the approximate Q-functions and policy functions of agents. This distributed neural policy gradient algorithm consists of two key components: the distributed critic step and the decentralized actor step. In the distributed critic step, agents receive the approximate Q-function parameters from their neighboring agents via a time-varying communication networks to collaboratively evaluate the joint policy. In contrast, in the decentralized actor step, each agent updates its local policy parameter solely based on its own approximate Q-function. In the convergence analysis, we first establish the global convergence of agents for the joint policy evaluation in the distributed critic step. Subsequently, we rigorously demonstrate the global convergence of the overall distributed neural policy gradient algorithm with respect to the objective function. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it with a centralized algorithm through simulation in the robot path planning environment.

Abstract: Gene selection in high-dimensional genomic data is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and improving therapeutic outcomes. Traditional feature selection methods effectively identify predictive genes but often ignore complex biological pathways and regulatory networks, leading to unstable and biologically irrelevant signatures. Prior approaches, such as Lasso-based methods and statistical filtering, either focus solely on individual gene-outcome associations or fail to capture pathway-level interactions, presenting a key challenge: how to integrate biological pathway knowledge while maintaining statistical rigor in gene selection? To address this gap, we propose a novel two-stage framework that integrates statistical selection with biological pathway knowledge using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). First, we introduce a pathway-guided pre-filtering strategy that leverages multiple statistical methods alongside KEGG pathway information for initial dimensionality reduction. Next, for refined selection, we model genes as collaborative agents in a MARL framework, where each agent optimizes both predictive power and biological relevance. Our framework incorporates pathway knowledge through Graph Neural Network-based state representations, a reward mechanism combining prediction performance with gene centrality and pathway coverage, and collaborative learning strategies using shared memory and a centralized critic component. Extensive experiments on multiple gene expression datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both prediction accuracy and biological interpretability compared to traditional methods.

<title>Towards a Generalizable Bimanual Foundation Policy via Flow-based Video Prediction</title>

Abstract: Learning a generalizable bimanual manipulation policy is extremely challenging for embodied agents due to the large action space and the need for coordinated arm movements. Existing approaches rely on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to acquire bimanual policies. However, transferring knowledge from single-arm datasets or pre-trained VLA models often fails to generalize effectively, primarily due to the scarcity of bimanual data and the fundamental differences between single-arm and bimanual manipulation. In this paper, we propose a novel bimanual foundation policy by fine-tuning the leading text-to-video models to predict robot trajectories and training a lightweight diffusion policy for action generation. Given the lack of embodied knowledge in text-to-video models, we introduce a two-stage paradigm that fine-tunes independent text-to-flow and flow-to-video models derived from a pre-trained text-to-video model. Specifically, optical flow serves as an intermediate variable, providing a concise representation of subtle movements between images. The text-to-flow model predicts optical flow to concretize the intent of language instructions, and the flow-to-video model leverages this flow for fine-grained video prediction. Our method mitigates the ambiguity of language in single-stage text-to-video prediction and significantly reduces the robot-data requirement by avoiding direct use of low-level actions. In experiments, we collect high-quality manipulation data for real dual-arm robot, and the results of simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Developing autonomous agents capable of mastering complex, multi-step tasks in unpredictable, interactive environments presents a significant challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for planning, existing approaches often rely on problematic internal knowledge or make unrealistic environmental assumptions. Although recent work explores learning planning knowledge, they still retain limitations due to partial reliance on external knowledge or impractical setups. Indeed, prior research has largely overlooked developing agents capable of acquiring planning knowledge from scratch, directly in realistic settings. While realizing this capability is necessary, it presents significant challenges, primarily achieving robustness given the substantial risk of incorporating LLMs' inaccurate knowledge. Moreover, efficiency is crucial for practicality as learning can demand prohibitive exploration. In response, we introduce Robust and Efficient Planning for Open-world Agents (REPOA), a novel framework designed to tackle these issues. REPOA features three key components: adaptive dependency learning and fine-grained failure-aware operation memory to enhance robustness to knowledge inaccuracies, and difficulty-based exploration to improve learning efficiency. Our evaluation in two established open-world testbeds demonstrates REPOA's robust and efficient planning, showcasing its capability to successfully obtain challenging late-game items that were beyond the reach of prior approaches.

<title>Proxy Target: Bridging the Gap Between Discrete Spiking Neural Networks and Continuous Control</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer low-latency and energy-efficient decision making through neuromorphic hardware, making them compelling for Reinforcement Learning (RL) in resource-constrained edge devices. Recent studies in this field directly replace Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by SNNs in existing RL frameworks, overlooking whether the RL algorithm is suitable for SNNs. However, most RL algorithms in continuous control are designed tailored to ANNs, including the target network soft updates mechanism, which conflict with the discrete, non-differentiable dynamics of SNN spikes. We identify that this mismatch destabilizes SNN training in continuous control tasks. To bridge this gap between discrete SNN and continuous control, we propose a novel proxy target framework. The continuous and differentiable dynamics of the proxy target enable smooth updates, bypassing the incompatibility of SNN spikes, stabilizing the RL algorithms. Since the proxy network operates only during training, the SNN retains its energy efficiency during deployment without inference overhead. Extensive experiments on continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that compared to vanilla SNNs, the proxy target framework enables SNNs to achieve up to 32% higher performance across different spiking neurons. Notably, we are the first to surpass ANN performance in continuous control with simple Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons. This work motivates a new class of SNN-friendly RL algorithms tailored to SNN's characteristics, paving the way for neuromorphic agents that combine high performance with low power consumption.

Abstract: Digital tool-based agents that invoke external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) often rely on documentation to understand API functionality. However, such documentation is frequently missing, outdated, privatized, or inconsistent-hindering the development of reliable, general-purpose agents. In this work, we propose learning API functionality directly from demonstrations as a new paradigm applicable in scenarios without documentation. Using existing API benchmarks, we collect demonstrations from both expert API-based agents and from self-exploration. To understand what information demonstrations must convey for successful task completion, we extensively study how the number of demonstrations and the use of LLM-generated summaries and evaluations affect the task success rate of the API-based agent. Our experiments across 3 datasets and 5 models show that learning functionality from demonstrations remains a non-trivial challenge, even for state-of-the-art LLMs. We find that providing explicit function calls and natural language critiques significantly improves the agent's task success rate due to more accurate parameter filling. We analyze failure modes, identify sources of error, and highlight key open challenges for future work in documentation-free, self-improving, API-based agents.

Abstract: Can your humanoid walk up and hand you a full cup of beer, without spilling a drop? While humanoids are increasingly featured in flashy demos like dancing, delivering packages, traversing rough terrain, fine-grained control during locomotion remains a significant challenge. In particular, stabilizing a filled end-effector (EE) while walking is far from solved, due to a fundamental mismatch in task dynamics: locomotion demands slow-timescale, robust control, whereas EE stabilization requires rapid, high-precision corrections. To address this, we propose SoFTA, a Slow-Fast TwoAgent framework that decouples upper-body and lower-body control into separate agents operating at different frequencies and with distinct rewards. This temporal and objective separation mitigates policy interference and enables coordinated whole-body behavior. SoFTA executes upper-body actions at 100 Hz for precise EE control and lower-body actions at 50 Hz for robust gait. It reduces EE acceleration by 2-5x relative to baselines and performs much closer to human-level stability, enabling delicate tasks such as carrying nearly full cups, capturing steady video during locomotion, and disturbance rejection with EE stability.

Abstract: The rise of large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) introduces new security and reliability challenges. While these systems show great promise in decomposing and coordinating complex tasks, they also face multi-faceted risks across prompt manipulation, unsafe tool usage, and emergent agent miscoordination. Existing guardrail mechanisms offer only partial protection, primarily at the input-output level, and fall short in addressing systemic or multi-point failures in MAS. In this work, we present a system-level anomaly detection framework tailored for MAS, integrating structural modeling with runtime behavioral oversight. Our approach consists of two components. First, we propose a graph-based framework that models agent interactions as dynamic execution graphs, enabling semantic anomaly detection at node, edge, and path levels. Second, we introduce a pluggable SentinelAgent, an LLM-powered oversight agent that observes, analyzes, and intervenes in MAS execution based on security policies and contextual reasoning. By bridging abstract detection logic with actionable enforcement, our method detects not only single-point faults and prompt injections but also multi-agent collusion and latent exploit paths. We validate our framework through two case studies, including an email assistant and Microsoft's Magentic-One system, demonstrating its ability to detect covert risks and provide explainable root-cause attribution. Our work lays the foundation for more trustworthy, monitorable, and secure agent-based AI ecosystems.

Abstract: While multi-agent LLM systems show strong capabilities in various domains, they are highly vulnerable to adversarial and low-performing agents. To resolve this issue, in this paper, we introduce a general and adversary-resistant multi-agent LLM framework based on credibility scoring. We model the collaborative query-answering process as an iterative game, where the agents communicate and contribute to a final system output. Our system associates a credibility score that is used when aggregating the team outputs. The credibility scores are learned gradually based on the past contributions of each agent in query answering. Our experiments across multiple tasks and settings demonstrate our system's effectiveness in mitigating adversarial influence and enhancing the resilience of multi-agent cooperation, even in the adversary-majority settings.

<title>Proactive Guidance of Multi-Turn Conversation in Industrial Search</title>

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced multi-turn conversation systems, emphasizing the need for proactive guidance to enhance users' interactions. However, these systems face challenges in dynamically adapting to shifts in users' goals and maintaining low latency for real-time interactions. In the Baidu Search AI assistant, an industrial-scale multi-turn search system, we propose a novel two-phase framework to provide proactive guidance. The first phase, Goal-adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning (G-SFT), employs a goal adaptation agent that dynamically adapts to user goal shifts and provides goal-relevant contextual information. G-SFT also incorporates scalable knowledge transfer to distill insights from LLMs into a lightweight model for real-time interaction. The second phase, Click-oriented Reinforcement Learning (C-RL), adopts a generate-rank paradigm, systematically constructs preference pairs from user click signals, and proactively improves click-through rates through more engaging guidance. This dual-phase architecture achieves complementary objectives: G-SFT ensures accurate goal tracking, while C-RL optimizes interaction quality through click signal-driven reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves 86.10% accuracy in offline evaluation (+23.95% over baseline) and 25.28% CTR in online deployment (149.06% relative improvement), while reducing inference latency by 69.55% through scalable knowledge distillation.

<title>Rethinking Continual Learning with Progressive Neural Collapse</title>

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) seeks to build an agent that can continuously learn a sequence of tasks, where a key challenge, namely Catastrophic Forgetting, persists due to the potential knowledge interference among different tasks. On the other hand, deep neural networks (DNNs) are shown to converge to a terminal state termed Neural Collapse during training, where all class prototypes geometrically form a static simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). These maximally and equally separated class prototypes make the ETF an ideal target for model learning in CL to mitigate knowledge interference. Thus inspired, several studies have emerged very recently to leverage a fixed global ETF in CL, which however suffers from key drawbacks, such as impracticability and limited performance.To address these challenges and fully unlock the potential of ETF in CL, we propose Progressive Neural Collapse (ProNC), a novel framework that completely removes the need of a fixed global ETF in CL. Specifically, ProNC progressively expands the ETF target in a principled way by adding new class prototypes as vertices for new tasks, ensuring maximal separability across all encountered classes with minimal shifts from the previous ETF. We next develop a new CL framework by plugging ProNC into commonly used CL algorithm designs, where distillation is further leveraged to balance between target shifting for old classes and target aligning for new classes. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms related baselines while maintaining superior flexibility, simplicity, and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in simulating human behaviors and performing theory-of-mind (ToM) reasoning, a crucial skill for complex social interactions. In this study, we investigate the role of ToM reasoning in aligning agentic behaviors with human norms in negotiation tasks, using the ultimatum game as a controlled environment. We initialized LLM agents with different prosocial beliefs (including Greedy, Fair, and Selfless) and reasoning methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) and varying ToM levels, and examined their decision-making processes across diverse LLMs, including reasoning models like o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Qwen 32B. Results from 2,700 simulations indicated that ToM reasoning enhances behavior alignment, decision-making consistency, and negotiation outcomes. Consistent with previous findings, reasoning models exhibit limited capability compared to models with ToM reasoning, different roles of the game benefits with different orders of ToM reasoning. Our findings contribute to the understanding of ToM's role in enhancing human-AI interaction and cooperative decision-making. The code used for our experiments can be found at https://github.com/Stealth-py/UltimatumToM.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved significant progress in large-scale traffic control, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. Drawing inspiration from biological systems where roles naturally emerge to enable coordination, role-based MARL methods have been proposed to enhance cooperation learning for complex tasks. However, existing methods exclusively derive roles from an agent's past experience during training, neglecting their influence on its future trajectories. This paper introduces a key insight: an agent's role should shape its future behavior to enable effective coordination. Hence, we propose Role Discovery and Diversity through Dynamics Models (R3DM), a novel role-based MARL framework that learns emergent roles by maximizing the mutual information between agents' roles, observed trajectories, and expected future behaviors. R3DM optimizes the proposed objective through contrastive learning on past trajectories to first derive intermediate roles that shape intrinsic rewards to promote diversity in future behaviors across different roles through a learned dynamics model. Benchmarking on SMAC and SMACv2 environments demonstrates that R3DM outperforms state-of-the-art MARL approaches, improving multi-agent coordination to increase win rates by up to 20%.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in autonomous driving employs a trial-and-error mechanism, enhancing robustness in unpredictable environments. However, crafting effective reward functions remains challenging, as conventional approaches rely heavily on manual design and demonstrate limited efficacy in complex scenarios. To address this issue, this study introduces a responsibility-oriented reward function that explicitly incorporates traffic regulations into the RL framework. Specifically, we introduced a Traffic Regulation Knowledge Graph and leveraged Vision-Language Models alongside Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques to automate reward assignment. This integration guides agents to adhere strictly to traffic laws, thus minimizing rule violations and optimizing decision-making performance in diverse driving conditions. Experimental validations demonstrate that the proposed methodology significantly improves the accuracy of assigning accident responsibilities and effectively reduces the agent's liability in traffic incidents.

Abstract: In an online fair allocation problem, a sequence of indivisible items arrives online and needs to be allocated to offline agents immediately and irrevocably. In our paper, we study the online allocation of either goods or chores. We adapt popular fairness notions, including envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and maximin share fairness (MMS), and use utilitarian social welfare (USW) to measure efficiency. For both settings of items, we present a series of positive results regarding the existence of fair and efficient allocations with widely studied classes of binary and bivalued valuation/cost functions. Additionally, we complement our results by constructing some counterexamples to establish our results as among the best guarantees possible.

Abstract: Language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding, reasoning, and executing complex tasks. However, developing robust agents presents significant challenges: substantial engineering overhead, lack of standardized components, and insufficient evaluation frameworks for fair comparison. We introduce Agent Graph-based Orchestration for Reasoning and Assessment (AGORA), a flexible and extensible framework that addresses these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a modular architecture with a graph-based workflow engine, efficient memory management, and clean component abstraction; (2) a comprehensive suite of reusable agent algorithms implementing state-of-the-art reasoning approaches; and (3) a rigorous evaluation framework enabling systematic comparison across multiple dimensions. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning and multimodal tasks, we evaluate various agent algorithms across different LLMs, revealing important insights about their relative strengths and applicability. Our results demonstrate that while sophisticated reasoning approaches can enhance agent capabilities, simpler methods like Chain-of-Thought often exhibit robust performance with significantly lower computational overhead. AGORA not only simplifies language agent development but also establishes a foundation for reproducible agent research through standardized evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in offline multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) have harnessed the powerful capabilities of the Transformer architecture, most approaches focus on a limited number of tasks, with scaling to extremely massive tasks remaining a formidable challenge. In this paper, we first revisit the key impact of task numbers on current MTRL method, and further reveal that naively expanding the parameters proves insufficient to counteract the performance degradation as the number of tasks escalates. Building upon these insights, we propose M3DT, a novel mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework that tackles task scalability by further unlocking the model's parameter scalability. Specifically, we enhance both the architecture and the optimization of the agent, where we strengthen the Decision Transformer (DT) backbone with MoE to reduce task load on parameter subsets, and introduce a three-stage training mechanism to facilitate efficient training with optimal performance. Experimental results show that, by increasing the number of experts, M3DT not only consistently enhances its performance as model expansion on the fixed task numbers, but also exhibits remarkable task scalability, successfully extending to 160 tasks with superior performance.

Abstract: Over the last thirty years, considerable progress has been made with the development of systems that can drive cars, play games, predict protein folding and generate natural language. These systems are described as intelligent and there has been a great deal of talk about the rapid increase in artificial intelligence and its potential dangers. However, our theoretical understanding of intelligence and ability to measure it lag far behind our capacity for building systems that mimic intelligent human behaviour. There is no commonly agreed definition of the intelligence that AI systems are said to possess. No-one has developed a practical measure that would enable us to compare the intelligence of humans, animals and AIs on a single ratio scale.
  This paper sets out a new universal measure of intelligence that is based on the hypothesis that prediction is the most important component of intelligence. As an agent interacts with its normal environment, the accuracy of its predictions is summed up and the complexity of its predictions and perceived environment is accounted for using Kolmogorov complexity. Two experiments were carried out to evaluate the practical feasibility of the algorithm. These demonstrated that it could measure the intelligence of an agent embodied in a virtual maze and an agent that makes predictions about time-series data. This universal measure could be the starting point for a new comparative science of intelligence that ranks humans, animals and AIs on a single ratio scale.

Abstract: Although multi-agent systems based on large language models show strong capabilities on multiple tasks, they are still limited by high computational overhead, information loss, and robustness. Inspired by ResNet's residual learning, we propose Residual Mixture-of-Agents (RMoA), integrating residual connections to optimize efficiency and reliability. To maximize information utilization from model responses while minimizing computational costs, we innovatively design an embedding-based diversity selection mechanism that greedily selects responses via vector similarity. Furthermore, to mitigate iterative information degradation, we introduce a Residual Extraction Agent to preserve cross-layer incremental information by capturing inter-layer response differences, coupled with a Residual Aggregation Agent for hierarchical information integration. Additionally, we propose an adaptive termination mechanism that dynamically halts processing based on residual convergence, further improving inference efficiency. RMoA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmarks of across alignment, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and multitasking understanding, while significantly reducing computational overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/mindhunter01/RMoA.

Abstract: We study the problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods to agents in an online setting, where goods arrive sequentially and must be allocated irrevocably to agents. Focusing on the popular fairness notions of envy-freeness, proportionality, and maximin share fairness (and their approximate variants), we ask how the availability of information on future goods influences the existence and approximability of fair allocations. In the absence of any such information, we establish strong impossibility results, demonstrating the inherent difficulty of achieving even approximate fairness guarantees. In contrast, we demonstrate that knowledge of additional information -- such as aggregate of each agent's total valuations (equivalently, normalized valuations) or the multiset of future goods values (frequency predictions) -- would enable the design of fairer online algorithms. Given normalization information, we propose an algorithm that achieves stronger fairness guarantees than previously known results. Given frequency predictions, we introduce a meta-algorithm that leverages frequency predictions to match the best-known offline guarantees for a broad class of ''share-based'' fairness notions. Our complementary impossibility results in each setting underscore both the limitations imposed by uncertainty about future goods and the potential of leveraging structured information to achieve fairer outcomes in online fair division.

<title>Melding the Serverless Control Plane with the Conventional Cluster Manager for Speed and Compatibility</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24551</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern serverless applications, often interactive with highly volatile traffic, challenge system scalability, demanding control planes that deliver low latency and cost efficiency. Analysis of production traces and existing systems reveals that current control plane designs (synchronous and asynchronous), particularly when built on conventional cluster managers like Kubernetes, struggle with this balance, often wasting significant CPU and memory resources on creating underutilized or idle instances. While clean-slate approaches like Dirigent offer performance gains, they sacrifice compatibility with established cluster management ecosystems.
  We introduce WaveLink, a serverless system designed to achieve high performance and low cost while maintaining compatibility with conventional cluster managers. WaveLink employs a novel dual-track control plane. A standard asynchronous track manages long-lived, full-featured regular instances for handling predictable, sustainable traffic, preserving full compatibility and feature sets off the critical path. Concurrently, an expedited parallel track addresses excessive traffic bursts that trigger cold starts. This fast path utilizes node-local agents (Wavelets) to rapidly spawn short-lived Emergency Instances with a reduced feature set, critically bypassing the latency overhead of the main cluster manager.
  Our experiments demonstrate that WaveLink, while remaining compatible with conventional managers for >98% invocation traffic, achieves 35% faster end-to-end performance at a comparable cost to the incompatible Dirigent system. WaveLink outperforms Kubernetes-compatible systems with synchronous control planes by 1.5-3.5x at 8-21% lower cost, and surpasses asynchronous counterparts by 1.7-3.5x at 3-33% lower cost.

Abstract: Understanding complex character relations is crucial for narrative analysis and efficient script evaluation, yet existing extraction methods often fail to handle long-form narratives with nuanced interactions. To address this challenge, we present CREFT, a novel sequential framework leveraging specialized Large Language Model (LLM) agents. First, CREFT builds a base character graph through knowledge distillation, then iteratively refines character composition, relation extraction, role identification, and group assignments. Experiments on a curated Korean drama dataset demonstrate that CREFT significantly outperforms single-agent LLM baselines in both accuracy and completeness. By systematically visualizing character networks, CREFT streamlines narrative comprehension and accelerates script review -- offering substantial benefits to the entertainment, publishing, and educational sectors.

Abstract: Summarizing long-form narratives--such as books, movies, and TV scripts--requires capturing intricate plotlines, character interactions, and thematic coherence, a task that remains challenging for existing LLMs. We introduce NexusSum, a multi-agent LLM framework for narrative summarization that processes long-form text through a structured, sequential pipeline--without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) Dialogue-to-Description Transformation: A narrative-specific preprocessing method that standardizes character dialogue and descriptive text into a unified format, improving coherence. (2) Hierarchical Multi-LLM Summarization: A structured summarization pipeline that optimizes chunk processing and controls output length for accurate, high-quality summaries. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art in narrative summarization, achieving up to a 30.0% improvement in BERTScore (F1) across books, movies, and TV scripts. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-agent LLMs in handling long-form content, offering a scalable approach for structured summarization in diverse storytelling domains.

Abstract: Endowing dialogue agents with persona information has proven to significantly improve the consistency and diversity of their generations. While much focus has been placed on aligning dialogues with provided personas, the adaptation to the interlocutor's profile remains largely underexplored. In this work, we investigate three key aspects: (1) a model's ability to align responses with both the provided persona and the interlocutor's; (2) its robustness when dealing with familiar versus unfamiliar interlocutors and topics, and (3) the impact of additional fine-tuning on specific persona-based dialogues. We evaluate dialogues generated with diverse speaker pairings and topics, framing the evaluation as an author identification task and employing both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations. By systematically masking or disclosing information about the interlocutor, we assess its impact on dialogue generation. Results show that access to the interlocutor's persona improves the recognition of the target speaker, while masking it does the opposite. Although models generalise well across topics, they struggle with unfamiliar interlocutors. Finally, we found that in zero-shot settings, LLMs often copy biographical details, facilitating identification but trivialising the task.

Abstract: The Computing Continuum (CC) is an emerging Internet-based computing paradigm that spans from local Internet of Things sensors and constrained edge devices to large-scale cloud data centers. Its goal is to orchestrate a vast array of diverse and distributed computing resources to support the next generation of Internet-based applications. However, the distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic nature of CC platforms demands distributed intelligence for adaptive and resilient service management. This article introduces a distributed stream processing pipeline as a CC use case, where each service is managed by an Active Inference (AIF) agent. These agents collaborate to fulfill service needs specified by SLOiDs, a term we introduce to denote Service Level Objectives that are aware of its deployed devices, meaning that non-functional requirements must consider the characteristics of the hosting device. We demonstrate how AIF agents can be modeled and deployed alongside distributed services to manage them autonomously. Our experiments show that AIF agents achieve over 90% SLOiD fulfillment when using tested transition models, and around 80% when learning the models during deployment. We compare their performance to a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, finding that while both approaches yield similar results, MARL requires extensive training, whereas AIF agents can operate effectively from the start. Additionally, we evaluate the behavior of AIF agents in offloading scenarios, observing a strong capacity for adaptation. Finally, we outline key research directions to advance AIF integration in CC platforms.

Abstract: Augmenting the input of algorithms with predictions is an algorithm design paradigm that suggests leveraging a (possibly erroneous) prediction to improve worst-case performance guarantees when the prediction is perfect (consistency), while also providing a performance guarantee when the prediction fails (robustness). Recently, Xu and Lu [2022] and Agrawal et al. [2024] proposed to consider settings with strategic agents under this framework. In this paper, we initiate the study of budget-feasible mechanism design with predictions. These mechanisms model a procurement auction scenario in which an auctioneer (buyer) with a strict budget constraint seeks to purchase goods or services from a set of strategic agents, so as to maximize her own valuation function. We focus on the online version of the problem where the arrival order of agents is random. We design mechanisms that are truthful, budget-feasible, and achieve a significantly improved competitive ratio for both monotone and non-monotone submodular valuation functions compared to their state-of-the-art counterparts without predictions. Our results assume access to a prediction for the value of the optimal solution to the offline problem. We complement our positive results by showing that for the offline version of the problem, access to predictions is mostly ineffective in improving approximation guarantees.

Abstract: Continuous advancements in deep learning have led to significant progress in feature detection, resulting in enhanced accuracy in tasks like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Nevertheless, the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial attacks remains a challenge for their reliable deployment in applications, such as navigation of autonomous agents. Even though CNN-based SLAM algorithms are a growing area of research there is a notable absence of a comprehensive presentation and examination of adversarial attacks targeting CNN-based feature detectors, as part of a SLAM system. Our work introduces black-box adversarial perturbations applied to the RGB images fed into the GCN-SLAM algorithm. Our findings on the TUM dataset [30] reveal that even attacks of moderate scale can lead to tracking failure in as many as 76% of the frames. Moreover, our experiments highlight the catastrophic impact of attacking depth instead of RGB input images on the SLAM system.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) need to adapt their predictions to diverse cultural contexts to benefit diverse communities across the world. While previous efforts have focused on single-LLM, single-turn approaches, we propose to exploit the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to promote cultural adaptability. We introduce a Multi-Agent Debate framework, where two LLM-based agents debate over a cultural scenario and collaboratively reach a final decision. We propose two variants: one where either LLM agents exclusively debate and another where they dynamically choose between self-reflection and debate during their turns. We evaluate these approaches on 7 open-weight LLMs (and 21 LLM combinations) using the NormAd-ETI benchmark for social etiquette norms in 75 countries. Experiments show that debate improves both overall accuracy and cultural group parity over single-LLM baselines. Notably, multi-agent debate enables relatively small LLMs (7-9B) to achieve accuracies comparable to that of a much larger model (27B parameters).

Abstract: In today's digital society, personalization has become a crucial aspect of software applications, significantly impacting user experience and engagement. A new wave of intelligent user interfaces, such as AI-based conversational agents, has the potential to enable such personalization beyond what other types of interfaces could offer in the past. Personalization requires the ability to specify a complete user profile, covering as many dimensions as possible, such as potential accessibility constraints, interaction preferences, and even hobbies. In this sense, this paper presents the concepts of a unified user modeling language, aimed to combine previous approaches in a single proposal. Additionally, a proof of concept has been developed that leverages user profiles modeled using our language to automatically adapt a conversational agent.

<title>Causal-aware Large Language Models: Enhancing Decision-Making Through Learning, Adapting and Acting</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in decision-making due to the vast amount of knowledge stored within the models. However, these pre-trained models are prone to lack reasoning abilities and are difficult to adapt to new environments, further hindering their application to complex real-world tasks. To address these challenges, inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Causal-aware LLMs, which integrate the structural causal model (SCM) into the decision-making process to model, update, and utilize structured knowledge of the environment in a ``learning-adapting-acting" paradigm. Specifically, in the learning stage, we first utilize an LLM to extract the environment-specific causal entities and their causal relations to initialize a structured causal model of the environment. Subsequently,in the adapting stage, we update the structured causal model through external feedback about the environment, via an idea of causal intervention. Finally, in the acting stage, Causal-aware LLMs exploit structured causal knowledge for more efficient policy-making through the reinforcement learning agent. The above processes are performed iteratively to learn causal knowledge, ultimately enabling the causal-aware LLMs to achieve a more accurate understanding of the environment and make more efficient decisions. Experimental results across 22 diverse tasks within the open-world game ``Crafter" validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce CoRet, a dense retrieval model designed for code-editing tasks that integrates code semantics, repository structure, and call graph dependencies. The model focuses on retrieving relevant portions of a code repository based on natural language queries such as requests to implement new features or fix bugs. These retrieved code chunks can then be presented to a user or to a second code-editing model or agent. To train CoRet, we propose a loss function explicitly designed for repository-level retrieval. On SWE-bench and Long Code Arena's bug localisation datasets, we show that our model substantially improves retrieval recall by at least 15 percentage points over existing models, and ablate the design choices to show their importance in achieving these results.

Abstract: Automating AI research holds immense potential for accelerating scientific progress, yet current AI agents struggle with the complexities of rigorous, end-to-end experimentation. We introduce EXP-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate AI agents on complete research experiments sourced from influential AI publications. Given a research question and incomplete starter code, EXP-Bench challenges AI agents to formulate hypotheses, design and implement experimental procedures, execute them, and analyze results. To enable the creation of such intricate and authentic tasks with high-fidelity, we design a semi-autonomous pipeline to extract and structure crucial experimental details from these research papers and their associated open-source code. With the pipeline, EXP-Bench curated 461 AI research tasks from 51 top-tier AI research papers. Evaluations of leading LLM-based agents, such as OpenHands and IterativeAgent on EXP-Bench demonstrate partial capabilities: while scores on individual experimental aspects such as design or implementation correctness occasionally reach 20-35%, the success rate for complete, executable experiments was a mere 0.5%. By identifying these bottlenecks and providing realistic step-by-step experiment procedures, EXP-Bench serves as a vital tool for future AI agents to improve their ability to conduct AI research experiments. EXP-Bench is open-sourced at https://github.com/Just-Curieous/Curie/tree/main/benchmark/exp_bench.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have enabled models to produce high-quality images from textual descriptions. However, these models often struggle with complex instructions involving multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relationships. Existing benchmarks for evaluating T2I models primarily focus on general text-image alignment and fail to capture the nuanced requirements of complex, multi-faceted prompts. Given this gap, we introduce LongBench-T2I, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate T2I models under complex instructions. LongBench-T2I consists of 500 intricately designed prompts spanning nine diverse visual evaluation dimensions, enabling a thorough assessment of a model's ability to follow complex instructions. Beyond benchmarking, we propose an agent framework (Plan2Gen) that facilitates complex instruction-driven image generation without requiring additional model training. This framework integrates seamlessly with existing T2I models, using large language models to interpret and decompose complex prompts, thereby guiding the generation process more effectively. As existing evaluation metrics, such as CLIPScore, fail to adequately capture the nuances of complex instructions, we introduce an evaluation toolkit that automates the quality assessment of generated images using a set of multi-dimensional metrics. The data and code are released at https://github.com/yczhou001/LongBench-T2I.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a time-consuming and complex process, requiring precise, long-horizon user interactions with intricate 3D interfaces. While recent advances in AI-driven user interface (UI) agents show promise, most existing datasets and methods focus on short, low-complexity tasks in mobile or web applications, failing to capture the demands of professional engineering tools. In this work, we introduce VideoCAD, the first attempt at engineering UI interaction learning for precision tasks. Specifically, VideoCAD is a large-scale synthetic dataset consisting of over 41K annotated video recordings of CAD operations, generated using an automated framework for collecting high-fidelity UI action data from human-made CAD designs. Compared to existing datasets, VideoCAD offers an order of magnitude higher complexity in UI interaction learning for real-world engineering tasks, having up to a 20x longer time horizon than other datasets. We show two important downstream applications of VideoCAD: learning UI interactions from professional precision 3D CAD tools and a visual question-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal large language models' (LLM) spatial reasoning and video understanding abilities. To learn the UI interactions, we propose VideoCADFormer - a state-of-the-art model in learning CAD interactions directly from video, which outperforms multiple behavior cloning baselines. Both VideoCADFormer and the VQA benchmark derived from VideoCAD reveal key challenges in the current state of video-based UI understanding, including the need for precise action grounding, multi-modal and spatial reasoning, and long-horizon dependencies.

Abstract: Deep reasoning is fundamental for solving complex tasks, especially in vision-centric scenarios that demand sequential, multimodal understanding. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate agents with fully synthetic, single-turn queries, limited visual modalities, and lack a framework to assess reasoning quality over multiple steps as required in real-world settings. To address this, we introduce Agent-X, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating vision-centric agents multi-step and deep reasoning capabilities in real-world, multimodal settings. Agent- X features 828 agentic tasks with authentic visual contexts, including images, multi-image comparisons, videos, and instructional text. These tasks span six major agentic environments: general visual reasoning, web browsing, security and surveillance, autonomous driving, sports, and math reasoning. Our benchmark requires agents to integrate tool use with explicit, stepwise decision-making in these diverse settings. In addition, we propose a fine-grained, step-level evaluation framework that assesses the correctness and logical coherence of each reasoning step and the effectiveness of tool usage throughout the task. Our results reveal that even the best-performing models, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen families, struggle to solve multi-step vision tasks, achieving less than 50% full-chain success. These findings highlight key bottlenecks in current LMM reasoning and tool-use capabilities and identify future research directions in vision-centric agentic reasoning models.

Abstract: CAPTCHAs have been a critical bottleneck for deploying web agents in real-world applications, often blocking them from completing end-to-end automation tasks. While modern multimodal LLM agents have demonstrated impressive performance in static perception tasks, their ability to handle interactive, multi-step reasoning challenges like CAPTCHAs is largely untested. To address this gap, we introduce Open CaptchaWorld, the first web-based benchmark and platform specifically designed to evaluate the visual reasoning and interaction capabilities of MLLM-powered agents through diverse and dynamic CAPTCHA puzzles. Our benchmark spans 20 modern CAPTCHA types, totaling 225 CAPTCHAs, annotated with a new metric we propose: CAPTCHA Reasoning Depth, which quantifies the number of cognitive and motor steps required to solve each puzzle. Experimental results show that humans consistently achieve near-perfect scores, state-of-the-art MLLM agents struggle significantly, with success rates at most 40.0% by Browser-Use Openai-o3, far below human-level performance, 93.3%. This highlights Open CaptchaWorld as a vital benchmark for diagnosing the limits of current multimodal agents and guiding the development of more robust multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Past work has demonstrated that autonomous vehicles can drive more safely if they communicate with one another than if they do not. However, their communication has often not been human-understandable. Using natural language as a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication protocol offers the potential for autonomous vehicles to drive cooperatively not only with each other but also with human drivers. In this work, we propose a suite of traffic tasks in autonomous driving where vehicles in a traffic scenario need to communicate in natural language to facilitate coordination in order to avoid an imminent collision and/or support efficient traffic flow. To this end, this paper introduces a novel method, LLM+Debrief, to learn a message generation and high-level decision-making policy for autonomous vehicles through multi-agent discussion. To evaluate LLM agents for driving, we developed a gym-like simulation environment that contains a range of driving scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLM+Debrief is more effective at generating meaningful and human-understandable natural language messages to facilitate cooperation and coordination than a zero-shot LLM agent. Our code and demo videos are available at https://talking-vehicles.github.io/.

Abstract: A key aspect of a robot's knowledge base is self-awareness about what it is capable of doing. It allows to define which tasks it can be assigned to and which it cannot. We will refer to this knowledge as the Capability concept. As capabilities stems from the components the robot owns, they can be linked together. In this work, we hypothesize that this concept can be inferred from the components rather than merely linked to them. Therefore, we introduce an ontological means of inferring the agent's capabilities based on the components it owns as well as low-level capabilities. This inference allows the agent to acknowledge what it is able to do in a responsive way and it is generalizable to external entities the agent can carry for example. To initiate an action, the robot needs to link its capabilities with external entities. To do so, it needs to infer affordance relations from its capabilities as well as the external entity's dispositions. This work is part of a broader effort to integrate social affordances into a Human-Robot collaboration context and is an extension of an already existing ontology.

<title>AutoStudio: Crafting Consistent Subjects in Multi-turn Interactive Image Generation</title>

Abstract: As cutting-edge Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models already excel at producing remarkable single images, an even more challenging task, i.e., multi-turn interactive image generation begins to attract the attention of related research communities. This task requires models to interact with users over multiple turns to generate a coherent sequence of images. However, since users may switch subjects frequently, current efforts struggle to maintain subject consistency while generating diverse images. To address this issue, we introduce a training-free multi-agent framework called AutoStudio. AutoStudio employs three agents based on large language models (LLMs) to handle interactions, along with a stable diffusion (SD) based agent for generating high-quality images. Specifically, AutoStudio consists of (i) a subject manager to interpret interaction dialogues and manage the context of each subject, (ii) a layout generator to generate fine-grained bounding boxes to control subject locations, (iii) a supervisor to provide suggestions for layout refinements, and (iv) a drawer to complete image generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Parallel-UNet to replace the original UNet in the drawer, which employs two parallel cross-attention modules for exploiting subject-aware features. We also introduce a subject-initialized generation method to better preserve small subjects. Our AutoStudio hereby can generate a sequence of multi-subject images interactively and consistently. Extensive experiments on the public CMIGBench benchmark and human evaluations show that AutoStudio maintains multi-subject consistency across multiple turns well, and it also raises the state-of-the-art performance by 13.65% in average Frechet Inception Distance and 2.83% in average character-character similarity.

Abstract: Utilizing Graphic User Interface (GUI) for human-computer interaction is essential for accessing a wide range of digital tools. Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) highlight the compelling potential to develop versatile agents to help humans finish GUI navigation tasks. However, current VLMs are challenged in terms of fundamental abilities (OCR and grounding) and GUI knowledge (the functions and control methods of GUI elements), preventing them from becoming practical GUI agents. To solve these challenges, we contribute GUICourse, a suite of datasets to train visual-based GUI agents from general VLMs. First, we introduce the GUIEnv dataset to strengthen the OCR and grounding capabilities of VLMs. Then, we introduce the GUIAct and GUIChat datasets to enrich their knowledge of GUI components and interactions. Experiments demonstrate that our GUI agents have better performance on common GUI tasks than their baseline VLMs. Even the small-size GUI agent (with 3.1B parameters) can still work well on single-step and multi-step GUI tasks. Finally, we analyze the different varieties in the training stage of this agent by ablation study. Our source codes and datasets are released at https://github.com/yiye3/GUICourse.

Abstract: Communication between humans and robots (or virtual agents) is essential for interaction and often inspired by human communication, which uses gestures, facial expressions, gaze direction, and other explicit and implicit means. This work presents an interaction experiment where humans and virtual agents interact through explicit (gestures, manual entries using mouse and keyboard, voice, sound, and information on screen) and implicit (gaze direction, location, facial expressions, and raise of eyebrows) communication to evaluate the effect of mixed explicit-implicit communication against purely explicit communication. Results obtained using Bayesian parameter estimation show that the number of errors and task execution time did not significantly change when mixed explicit and implicit communications were used, and neither the perceived efficiency of the interaction. In contrast, acceptance, sociability, and transparency of the virtual agent increased when using mixed communication modalities (88.3%, 92%, and 92.9% of the effect size posterior distribution of each variable, respectively, were above the upper limit of the region of practical equivalence). This suggests that task-related measures, such as time, number of errors, and perceived efficiency of the interaction, have not been influenced by the communication type in our particular experiment. However, the improvement of subjective measures related to the virtual agent, such as acceptance, sociability, and transparency, suggests that humans are more receptive to mixed explicit and implicit communications.

Abstract: Although LLM-based agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), can use external tools and memory mechanisms to solve complex real-world tasks, they may also introduce critical security vulnerabilities. However, the existing literature does not comprehensively evaluate attacks and defenses against LLM-based agents. To address this, we introduce Agent Security Bench (ASB), a comprehensive framework designed to formalize, benchmark, and evaluate the attacks and defenses of LLM-based agents, including 10 scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, autonomous driving, finance), 10 agents targeting the scenarios, over 400 tools, 27 different types of attack/defense methods, and 7 evaluation metrics. Based on ASB, we benchmark 10 prompt injection attacks, a memory poisoning attack, a novel Plan-of-Thought backdoor attack, 4 mixed attacks, and 11 corresponding defenses across 13 LLM backbones. Our benchmark results reveal critical vulnerabilities in different stages of agent operation, including system prompt, user prompt handling, tool usage, and memory retrieval, with the highest average attack success rate of 84.30\%, but limited effectiveness shown in current defenses, unveiling important works to be done in terms of agent security for the community. We also introduce a new metric to evaluate the agents' capability to balance utility and security. Our code can be found at https://github.com/agiresearch/ASB.

Abstract: With large language models (LLMs) increasingly deployed as cognitive engines for AI agents, the reliability and effectiveness critically hinge on their intrinsic epistemic agency, which remains understudied. Epistemic agency, the ability to flexibly construct, adapt, and monitor beliefs about dynamic environments, represents a base-model-level capacity independent of specific tools, modules, or applications. We characterize the holistic process underlying epistemic agency, which unfolds in seven interrelated dimensions: prediction, decision-making, perception, memory, counterfactual thinking, belief updating, and meta-reflection. Correspondingly, we propose Reflection-Bench, a cognitive-psychology-inspired benchmark consisting of seven tasks with long-term relevance and minimization of data leakage. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 16 models using three prompting strategies, we identify a clear three-tier performance hierarchy and significant limitations of current LLMs, particularly in meta-reflection capabilities. While state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate rudimentary signs of epistemic agency, our findings suggest several promising research directions, including enhancing core cognitive functions, improving cross-functional coordination, and developing adaptive processing mechanisms. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/AI45Lab/ReflectionBench.

arXiv:2412.03621v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into mobile services over wireless networks to support complex user requests. This trend has led to longer prompts, which improve LLMs' performance but increase data transmission costs and require more processing time, thereby reducing overall system efficiency and negatively impacting user experience. To address these challenges, we propose Joint Prompt and Power Optimization (JPPO), a framework that jointly optimizes prompt compression and wireless transmission power for mobile LLM services. JPPO leverages a Small Language Model (SLM) deployed at edge devices to perform lightweight prompt compression, reducing communication load before transmission to the cloud-based LLM. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent dynamically adjusts both the compression ratio and transmission power based on network conditions and service constraints, aiming to minimize service time while preserving response fidelity. We further extend the framework to JPPO++, which introduces a denoising-inspired compression scheme. This design performs iterative prompt refinement by progressively removing less informative tokens, allowing for more aggressive yet controlled compression. Experimental results show that JPPO++ reduces service time by 17% compared to the no-compression baseline while maintaining output quality. Under compression-prioritized settings, a reduction of up to 16x in prompt length can be achieved with an acceptable loss in accuracy. Specifically, JPPO with a 16x ratio reduces total service time by approximately 42.3%, and JPPO++ further improves this reduction to 46.5%.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enabled dialogue systems have become one of the central modes in human-machine interaction, which bring about vast amounts of conversation logs and increasing demand for dialogue generation. The dialogue's life-cycle spans from $\textit{Prelude}$ through $\textit{Interlocution}$ to $\textit{Epilogue}$, encompassing rich dialogue elements. Despite large volumes of dialogue-related studies, there is a lack of systematic investigation into the dialogue stages to frame benchmark construction that covers comprehensive dialogue elements. This hinders the precise modeling, generation and assessment of LLMs-based dialogue systems. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce a new research task--$\textbf{D}$ialogue $\textbf{E}$lement $\textbf{MO}$deling, including $\textit{Element Awareness}$ and $\textit{Dialogue Agent Interaction}$, and propose a novel benchmark, $\textbf{DEMO}$, designed for a comprehensive dialogue modeling and assessment. On this basis, we further build the DEMO agent with the adept ability to model dialogue elements via imitation learning. Extensive experiments on DEMO indicate that current representative LLMs still have considerable potential for enhancement, and our DEMO agent performs well in both dialogue element modeling and out-of-domain tasks.

Abstract: Consider the scenario where multiple agents have to move in an optimal way through a network, each one towards their ending position while avoiding collisions. By optimal, we mean as fast as possible, which is evaluated by a measure known as the makespan of the proposed solution. This is the setting studied in the Multiagent Path Finding problem. In this work, we additionally provide the agents with a way to communicate with each other. Due to size constraints, it is reasonable to assume that the range of communication of each agent will be limited. What should be the trajectories of the agents to, additionally, maintain a backbone of communication? In this work, we study the Multiagent Path Finding with Communication Constraint problem under the parameterized complexity framework.
  Our main contribution is three exact algorithms that are efficient when considering particular structures for the input network. We provide such algorithms for the case when the communication range and the number of agents (the makespan resp.) are provided in the input and the network has a tree topology, or bounded maximum degree (has a tree-like topology, i.e., bounded treewidth resp.). We complement these results by showing that it is highly unlikely to construct efficient algorithms when considering the number of agents as part of the input, even if the makespan is $3$ and the communication range is $1$.

Abstract: The evolution of many dynamical systems that describe relationships or interactions between objects can be effectively modeled by temporal networks, which are typically represented as a sequence of static network snapshots. In this paper, we introduce a novel random walk-based approach that can identify clusters of time-snapshots in which network community structures are stable. This allows us to detect significant structural shifts over time, such as the splitting or merging of communities or their births and deaths. We also provide a low-dimensional representation of entire snapshots, placing those with similar community structure close to each other in the feature space. To validate our approach, we develop an agent-based algorithm that generates synthetic datasets with the desired characteristic properties, enabling thorough testing and benchmarking. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of our technique by testing it on various social dynamics models and real-world datasets and comparing its performance to several state-of-the-art algorithms. Our findings highlight the strength of our approach to correctly capture and analyze the dynamics of complex systems.

However, existing benchmarks often oversimplify real-world requirements by focusing on synthetic queries and limited constraints. We address the gap of evaluating language agents in multi-day, multi-POI travel planning scenarios with diverse and open human needs. Specifically, we introduce \emph{ChinaTravel}, the first open-ended benchmark grounded in authentic Chinese travel requirements collected from 1,154 human participants. We design a compositionally generalizable domain-specific language (DSL) for scalable evaluation, covering feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and preference comparison. Empirical studies reveal the potential of neuro-symbolic agents in travel planning, achieving a 37.0\% constraint satisfaction rate on human queries, a 10\times improvement over purely neural models. These findings highlight ChinaTravel as a pivotal milestone for advancing language agents in complex, real-world planning scenarios.

Abstract: Code auditing is the process of reviewing code with the aim of identifying bugs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities for this task without requiring compilation, while also supporting user-friendly customization. However, auditing a code repository with LLMs poses significant challenges: limited context windows and hallucinations can degrade the quality of bug reports, and analyzing large-scale repositories incurs substantial time and token costs, hindering efficiency and scalability.
  This work introduces an LLM-based agent, RepoAudit, designed to perform autonomous repository-level code auditing. Equipped with agent memory, RepoAudit explores the codebase on demand by analyzing data-flow facts along feasible program paths within individual functions. It further incorporates a validator module to mitigate hallucinations by verifying data-flow facts and checking the satisfiability of path conditions associated with potential bugs, thereby reducing false positives. RepoAudit detects 40 true bugs across 15 real-world benchmark projects with a precision of 78.43%, requiring on average only 0.44 hours and $2.54 per project. Also, it detects 185 new bugs in high-profile projects, among which 174 have been confirmed or fixed. We have open-sourced RepoAudit at https://github.com/PurCL/RepoAudit.

Abstract: While there has been plenty of work on generating tests from existing code, there has been limited work on generating tests from issues. A correct test must validate the code patch that resolves the issue. This paper focuses on the scenario where that code patch does not yet exist. Doing so supports two major use-cases. First, it supports TDD (test-driven development), the discipline of "test first, write code later" that has well-documented benefits for human software engineers. Second, it also validates SWE (software engineering) agents, which generate code patches for resolving issues. This paper introduces TDD-Bench-Verified, a benchmark for generating tests from issues, and Otter, an LLM-based solution for this task. Otter augments LLMs with rule-based analysis to check and repair their outputs, and introduces a novel self-reflective action planner. Experiments show Otter outperforming state-of-the-art systems for generating tests from issues, in addition to enhancing systems that generate patches from issues. We hope that Otter helps make developers more productive at resolving issues and leads to more robust, well-tested code.

<title>Byzantine Stable Matching</title>

Abstract: In stable matching, one must find a matching between two sets of agents, commonly men and women, or job applicants and job positions. Each agent has a preference ordering over who they want to be matched with. Moreover a matching is said to be stable if no pair of agents prefer each other over their current matching.
  We consider solving stable matching in a distributed synchronous setting, where each agent is its own process. Moreover, we assume up to $t_L$ agents on one side and $t_R$ on the other side can be byzantine. After properly defining the stable matching problem in this setting, we study its solvability.
  When there are as many agents on each side with fully-ordered preference lists, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for stable matching to be solvable in the synchronous setting. These conditions depend on the communication model used, i.e., if parties on the same side are allowed to communicate directly, and on the presence of a cryptographic setup, i.e., digital signatures.

Abstract: We introduce and formalize the notion of resource augmentation for maximin share allocations -- an idea that can be traced back to the seminal work of Budish [JPE 2011]. Specifically, given a fair division instance with $m$ goods and $n$ agents, we ask how many copies of the goods should be added in order to guarantee that each agent receives at least their original maximin share, or an approximation thereof. We establish a tight bound of $m/e$ copies for arbitrary monotone valuations. For additive valuations, we show that at most $\min\{n-2,\lfloor \frac{m}{3}\rfloor (1+o(1))\}$ copies suffice. For approximate-MMS in ordered instances, we give a tradeoff between the number of copies needed and the approximation guarantee. In particular, we prove that $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ copies suffice to guarantee a $6/7$-approximation to the original MMS, and $\lfloor n/3 \rfloor$ copies suffice for a $4/5$-approximation. Both results improve upon the best known approximation guarantees for additive valuations in the absence of copies.

Abstract: Tool use has turned large language models (LLMs) into powerful agents that can perform complex multi-step tasks by dynamically utilising external software components. However, these tools must be implemented in advance by human developers, hindering the applicability of LLM agents in domains demanding large numbers of highly specialised tools, like in life sciences and medicine. Motivated by the growing trend of scientific studies accompanied by public code repositories, we propose ToolMaker, an agentic framework that autonomously transforms papers with code into LLM-compatible tools. Given a GitHub URL and short task description, ToolMaker autonomously installs dependencies and generates code to perform the task, using a closed-loop self-correction mechanism for debugging. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark comprising 15 complex computational tasks spanning various domains with over 100 unit tests to assess correctness and robustness. Our method correctly implements 80% of the tasks, substantially outperforming current state-of-the-art software engineering agents. ToolMaker therefore is a step towards fully autonomous agent-based scientific workflows. Our code and benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/KatherLab/ToolMaker.

Abstract: We present a novel reasoning approach called Flow-of-Options (FoO), designed to address intrinsic biases in Large Language Models (LLMs). Flow-of-Options enables LLMs to systematically explore a diverse range of possibilities in their reasoning, as demonstrated by an FoO-based agentic framework developed for autonomously solving Machine Learning (ML) tasks. FoO enforces diversity in LLM solutions through compressed and interpretable task representations, resulting in improvements of 38.2% - 69.2% on standard data science tasks, and 37.4% - 47.9% on therapeutic chemistry tasks, as compared to state-of-the-art baselines. With an overall operation cost under $1 per task, our framework is well-suited for cost-sensitive applications. Going beyond tabular classification and regression, we show the broader applicability of our FoO-based agentic system to tasks such as reinforcement learning and image generation. Our code is open-sourced at: https://github.com/flagshippioneering/Flow-of-Options.

Abstract: Meeting summarization suffers from limited high-quality data, mainly due to privacy restrictions and expensive collection processes. We address this gap with FAME, a dataset of 500 meetings in English and 300 in German produced by MIMIC, our new multi-agent meeting synthesis framework that generates meeting transcripts on a given knowledge source by defining psychologically grounded participant profiles, outlining the conversation, and orchestrating a large language model (LLM) debate. A modular post-processing step refines these outputs, mitigating potential repetitiveness and overly formal tones, ensuring coherent, credible dialogues at scale. We also propose a psychologically grounded evaluation framework assessing naturalness, social behavior authenticity, and transcript difficulties. Human assessments show that FAME approximates real-meeting spontaneity (4.5/5 in naturalness), preserves speaker-centric challenges (3/5 in spoken language), and introduces richer information-oriented difficulty (4/5 in difficulty). These findings highlight that FAME is a good and scalable proxy for real-world meeting conditions. It enables new test scenarios for meeting summarization research and other conversation-centric applications in tasks requiring conversation data or simulating social scenarios under behavioral constraints.

Abstract: Scaling up executable code data is significant for improving language models' software engineering capability. The intricate nature of the process makes it labor-intensive, time-consuming and expert-knowledge-dependent to build a large number of executable code repositories, limiting the scalability of existing work based on running tests. The primary bottleneck lies in the automated building of test environments for different repositories, which is an essential yet underexplored task. To mitigate the gap, we introduce Repo2Run, the first LLM-based agent aiming at automating the building of executable test environments for any repositories at scale. Specifically, given a code repository, Repo2Run iteratively builds the Docker image, runs unit tests based on the feedback of the building, and synthesizes the Dockerfile until the entire pipeline is executed successfully. The resulting Dockerfile can then be used to create Docker container environments for running code and tests. We created a benchmark containing 420 Python repositories with unit tests for evaluation. The results illustrate that Repo2Run achieves an 86.0% success rate, outperforming SWE-agent by 77.0%. The resources of Repo2Run are available at https://github.com/bytedance/Repo2Run.

<title>iAgent: LLM Agent as a Shield between User and Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems usually take the user-platform paradigm, where users are directly exposed under the control of the platform's recommendation algorithms. However, the defect of recommendation algorithms may put users in very vulnerable positions under this paradigm. First, many sophisticated models are often designed with commercial objectives in mind, focusing on the platform's benefits, which may hinder their ability to protect and capture users' true interests. Second, these models are typically optimized using data from all users, which may overlook individual user's preferences. Due to these shortcomings, users may experience several disadvantages under the traditional user-platform direct exposure paradigm, such as lack of control over the recommender system, potential manipulation by the platform, echo chamber effects, or lack of personalization for less active users due to the dominance of active users during collaborative learning. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new paradigm to protect user interests and alleviate these issues. Recently, some researchers have introduced LLM agents to simulate user behaviors, these approaches primarily aim to optimize platform-side performance, leaving core issues in recommender systems unresolved. To address these limitations, we propose a new user-agent-platform paradigm, where agent serves as the protective shield between user and recommender system that enables indirect exposure.

Abstract: Automating scientific research is considered the final frontier of science. Recently, several papers claim autonomous research agents can generate novel research ideas. Amidst the prevailing optimism, we document a critical concern: a considerable fraction of such research documents are smartly plagiarized. Unlike past efforts where experts evaluate the novelty and feasibility of research ideas, we request $13$ experts to operate under a different situational logic: to identify similarities between LLM-generated research documents and existing work. Concerningly, the experts identify $24\%$ of the $50$ evaluated research documents to be either paraphrased (with one-to-one methodological mapping), or significantly borrowed from existing work. These reported instances are cross-verified by authors of the source papers. Experts find an additional $32\%$ ideas to partially overlap with prior work, and a small fraction to be completely original. Problematically, these LLM-generated research documents do not acknowledge original sources, and bypass inbuilt plagiarism detectors. Lastly, through controlled experiments we show that automated plagiarism detectors are inadequate at catching plagiarized ideas from such systems. We recommend a careful assessment of LLM-generated research, and discuss the implications of our findings on academic publishing.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has become a crucial technique for improving the performance of machine learning applications across domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and perception systems. However, in certain scenarios, particularly in resource-constrained environments, some modalities available during training may be absent during inference. While existing frameworks effectively utilize multiple data sources during training and enable inference with reduced modalities, they are primarily designed for single-agent settings. This poses a critical limitation in dynamic environments such as connected autonomous vehicles (CAV), where incomplete data coverage can lead to decision-making blind spots. Conversely, some works explore multi-agent collaboration but without addressing missing modality at test time. To overcome these limitations, we propose Collaborative Auxiliary Modality Learning (CAML), a novel multi-modal multi-agent framework that enables agents to collaborate and share multi-modal data during training, while allowing inference with reduced modalities during testing. Experimental results in collaborative decision-making for CAV in accident-prone scenarios demonstrate that CAML achieves up to a ${\bf 58.1}\%$ improvement in accident detection. Additionally, we validate CAML on real-world aerial-ground robot data for collaborative semantic segmentation, achieving up to a ${\bf 10.6}\%$ improvement in mIoU.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models in complex problem-solving; however, current MAS frameworks suffer from poor flexibility and scalability with underdeveloped optimization strategies. To address these challenges, we propose ReSo, which integrates task graph generation with a reward-driven two-stage agent selection process centered on our Collaborative Reward Model that provides fine-grained reward signals to optimize MAS cooperation. We also introduce an automated data synthesis framework for generating MAS benchmarks without any human annotations. Experimental results show that ReSo matches or outperforms existing methods, achieving 33.7 percent accuracy on Math-MAS and 32.3 percent accuracy on SciBench-MAS, where other approaches completely fail.

Abstract: Current audio generation conditioned by text or video focuses on aligning audio with text/video modalities. Despite excellent alignment results, these multimodal frameworks still cannot be directly applied to compelling movie storytelling involving multiple scenes, where "on-screen" sounds require temporally-aligned audio generation, while "off-screen" sounds contribute to appropriate environment sounds accompanied by background music when applicable. Inspired by professional movie production, this paper proposes a multi-agentic framework for audio generation supervised by an autonomous Sound Director agent, engaging multi-turn conversations with other agents for on-screen and off-screen sound generation through multimodal LLM. To address on-screen sound generation, after detecting any talking humans in videos, we capture semantically and temporally synchronized sound by training a prediction model that forecasts interpretable, time-varying audio control signals: loudness, pitch, and timbre, which are used by a Foley Artist agent to condition a cross-attention module in the sound generation. The Foley Artist works cooperatively with the Composer and Voice Actor agents, and together they autonomously generate off-screen sound to complement the overall production. Each agent takes on specific roles similar to those of a movie production team. To temporally ground audio language models, in ReelWave, text/video conditions are decomposed into atomic, specific sound generation instructions synchronized with visuals when applicable. Consequently, our framework can generate rich and relevant audio content conditioned on video clips extracted from movies.

Abstract: A distributed implementation of a Robust Integral of the Sign of the Error (RISE) controller is developed for multi-agent target tracking problems with exponential convergence guarantees. Previous RISE-based approaches for multi-agent systems required 2-hop communication, limiting practical applicability. New insights from a Lyapunov-based design-analysis approach are used to eliminate the need for multi-hop communication required in previous literature, while yielding exponential target tracking. The new insights include the development of a new P-function that works in tandem with the graph interaction matrix in the Lyapunov function. Nonsmooth Lyapunov-based stability analysis methods are used to yield semi-global exponential convergence to the target agent state despite the presence of bounded disturbances with bounded derivatives. The resulting outcome is a controller that achieves exponential target tracking with only local information exchange between neighboring agents.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the development of multi-agent systems where multiple LLM-based agents collaborate on complex tasks. However, existing systems often rely on centralized coordination, leading to scalability bottlenecks, reduced adaptability, and single points of failure. Privacy and proprietary knowledge concerns further hinder cross-organizational collaboration, resulting in siloed expertise. We propose AgentNet, a decentralized, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that enables LLM-based agents to specialize, evolve, and collaborate autonomously in a dynamically structured Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Unlike prior approaches with static roles or centralized control, AgentNet allows agents to adjust connectivity and route tasks based on local expertise and context. AgentNet introduces three key innovations: (1) a fully decentralized coordination mechanism that eliminates the need for a central orchestrator, enhancing robustness and emergent intelligence; (2) dynamic agent graph topology that adapts in real time to task demands, ensuring scalability and resilience; and (3) a retrieval-based memory system for agents that supports continual skill refinement and specialization. By minimizing centralized control and data exchange, AgentNet enables fault-tolerant, privacy-preserving collaboration across organizations. Experiments show that AgentNet achieves higher task accuracy than both single-agent and centralized multi-agent baselines.

Abstract: Modelling bounded rational decision-making through information constrained processing provides a principled approach for representing departures from rationality within a reinforcement learning framework, while still treating decision-making as an optimization process. However, existing approaches are generally based on Entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, or Mutual Information. In this work, we highlight issues with these approaches when dealing with ordinal action spaces. Specifically, entropy assumes uniform prior beliefs, missing the impact of a priori biases on decision-makings. KL-Divergence addresses this, however, has no notion of "nearness" of actions, and additionally, has several well known potentially undesirable properties such as the lack of symmetry, and furthermore, requires the distributions to have the same support (e.g. positive probability for all actions). Mutual information is often difficult to estimate. Here, we propose an alternative approach for modeling bounded rational RL agents utilising Wasserstein distances. This approach overcomes the aforementioned issues. Crucially, this approach accounts for the nearness of ordinal actions, modeling "stickiness" in agent decisions and unlikeliness of rapidly switching to far away actions, while also supporting low probability actions, zero-support prior distributions, and is simple to calculate directly.

Abstract: Cellular reprogramming, the artificial transformation of one cell type into another, has been attracting increasing research attention due to its therapeutic potential for complex diseases. However, discovering reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory networks and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode in the context of cellular reprogramming. To facilitate scalability, we consider our previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and we improve our procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. Finally, we devise a computational framework to solve the control problem. To leverage the structure of biological systems, we incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolutions into the artificial neural network approximator for the action-value function learned by the DRL agent. Experiments on a number of large real-world biological networks from literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms face significant challenges in optimizing order dispatching and driver repositioning operations in dynamic urban environments. Traditional approaches based on combinatorial optimization, rule-based heuristics, and reinforcement learning often overlook driver income fairness, interpretability, and adaptability to real-world dynamics. To address these gaps, we propose LLM-ODDR, a novel framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for joint Order Dispatching and Driver Repositioning (ODDR) in ride-hailing services. LLM-ODDR framework comprises three key components: (1) Multi-objective-guided Order Value Refinement, which evaluates orders by considering multiple objectives to determine their overall value; (2) Fairness-aware Order Dispatching, which balances platform revenue with driver income fairness; and (3) Spatiotemporal Demand-Aware Driver Repositioning, which optimizes idle vehicle placement based on historical patterns and projected supply. We also develop JointDR-GPT, a fine-tuned model optimized for ODDR tasks with domain knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets from Manhattan taxi operations demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of effectiveness, adaptability to anomalous conditions, and decision interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration of LLMs as decision-making agents in ride-hailing ODDR tasks, establishing foundational insights for integrating advanced language models within intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: The ability to continuously and efficiently transfer skills across tasks is a hallmark of biological intelligence and a long-standing goal in artificial systems. Reinforcement learning (RL), a dominant paradigm for learning in high-dimensional control tasks, is known to suffer from brittleness to task variations and catastrophic forgetting. Neuroevolution (NE) has recently gained attention for its robustness, scalability, and capacity to escape local optima. In this paper, we investigate an understudied dimension of NE: its transfer learning capabilities. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks: a) in stepping gates, neural networks are tasked with emulating logic circuits, with designs that emphasize modular repetition and variation b) ecorobot extends the Brax physics engine with objects such as walls and obstacles and the ability to easily switch between different robotic morphologies. Crucial in both benchmarks is the presence of a curriculum that enables evaluating skill transfer across tasks of increasing complexity. Our empirical analysis shows that NE methods vary in their transfer abilities and frequently outperform RL baselines. Our findings support the potential of NE as a foundation for building more adaptable agents and highlight future challenges for scaling NE to complex, real-world problems.

Abstract: Assessing the quality of public transportation services requires the analysis of large quantities of data on the scheduled and actual trips and documents listing the quality constraints each service needs to meet. Interrogating such datasets with SQL queries, organizing and visualizing the data can be quite complex for most users. This paper presents a chatbot offering a user-friendly tool to interact with these datasets and support decision making. It is based on an agent architecture, which expands the capabilities of the core Large Language Model (LLM) by allowing it to interact with a series of tools that can execute several tasks, like performing SQL queries, plotting data and creating maps from the coordinates of a trip and its stops. This paper also tackles one of the main open problems of such Generative AI projects: collecting data to measure the system's performance. Our chatbot has been extensively tested with a workflow that asks several questions and stores the generated query, the retrieved data and the natural language response for each of them. Such questions are drawn from a set of base examples which are then completed with actual data from the database. This procedure yields a dataset for the evaluation of the chatbot's performance, especially the consistency of its answers and the correctness of the generated queries.

<title>HiDream-I1: A High-Efficient Image Generative Foundation Model with Sparse Diffusion Transformer</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in image generative foundation models have prioritized quality improvements but often at the cost of increased computational complexity and inference latency. To address this critical trade-off, we introduce HiDream-I1, a new open-source image generative foundation model with 17B parameters that achieves state-of-the-art image generation quality within seconds. HiDream-I1 is constructed with a new sparse Diffusion Transformer (DiT) structure. Specifically, it starts with a dual-stream decoupled design of sparse DiT with dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, in which two separate encoders are first involved to independently process image and text tokens. Then, a single-stream sparse DiT structure with dynamic MoE architecture is adopted to trigger multi-model interaction for image generation in a cost-efficient manner. To support flexiable accessibility with varied model capabilities, we provide HiDream-I1 in three variants: HiDream-I1-Full, HiDream-I1-Dev, and HiDream-I1-Fast.
  Furthermore, we go beyond the typical text-to-image generation and remould HiDream-I1 with additional image conditions to perform precise, instruction-based editing on given images, yielding a new instruction-based image editing model namely HiDream-E1. Ultimately, by integrating text-to-image generation and instruction-based image editing, HiDream-I1 evolves to form a comprehensive image agent (HiDream-A1) capable of fully interactive image creation and refinement. To accelerate multi-modal AIGC research, we have open-sourced all the codes and model weights of HiDream-I1-Full, HiDream-I1-Dev, HiDream-I1-Fast, HiDream-E1 through our project websites: https://github.com/HiDream-ai/HiDream-I1 and https://github.com/HiDream-ai/HiDream-E1. All features can be directly experienced via https://vivago.ai/studio.

<title>Enhancing Lifelong Multi-Agent Path-finding by Using Artificial Potential Fields</title>

Abstract: We explore the use of Artificial Potential Fields (APFs) to solve Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) and Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) problems. In MAPF, a team of agents must move to their goal locations without collisions, whereas in LMAPF, new goals are generated upon arrival. We propose methods for incorporating APFs in a range of MAPF algorithms, including Prioritized Planning, MAPF-LNS2, and Priority Inheritance with Backtracking (PIBT). Experimental results show that using APF is not beneficial for MAPF but yields up to a 7-fold increase in overall system throughput for LMAPF.

<title>Calibrated Value-Aware Model Learning with Stochastic Environment Models</title>

Abstract: The idea of value-aware model learning, that models should produce accurate value estimates, has gained prominence in model-based reinforcement learning. The MuZero loss, which penalizes a model's value function prediction compared to the ground-truth value function, has been utilized in several prominent empirical works in the literature. However, theoretical investigation into its strengths and weaknesses is limited. In this paper, we analyze the family of value-aware model learning losses, which includes the popular MuZero loss. We show that these losses, as normally used, are uncalibrated surrogate losses, which means that they do not always recover the correct model and value function. Building on this insight, we propose corrections to solve this issue. Furthermore, we investigate the interplay between the loss calibration, latent model architectures, and auxiliary losses that are commonly employed when training MuZero-style agents. We show that while deterministic models can be sufficient to predict accurate values, learning calibrated stochastic models is still advantageous.

<title>MEDAL: A Framework for Benchmarking LLMs as Multilingual Open-Domain Chatbots and Dialogue Evaluators</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22777</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the capabilities of chatbots and their underlying LLMs continue to dramatically improve, evaluating their performance has increasingly become a major blocker to their further development. A major challenge is the available benchmarking datasets, which are largely static, outdated, and lacking in multilingual coverage, limiting their ability to capture subtle linguistic and cultural variations. This paper introduces MEDAL, an automated multi-agent framework for generating, evaluating, and curating more representative and diverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages several state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues, conditioned on varied seed contexts. A strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is then used for a multidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering noticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale evaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and human-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then used to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act as evaluators of open-domain dialogues. We find that current LLMs struggle to detect nuanced issues, particularly those involving empathy and reasoning.

Abstract: Recent manufacturing systems are increasingly adopting multi-robot collaboration to handle complex and dynamic environments. While multi-agent architectures support decentralized coordination among robot agents, they often face challenges in enabling real-time adaptability for unexpected disruptions without predefined rules. Recent advances in large language models offer new opportunities for context-aware decision-making to enable adaptive responses to unexpected changes. This paper presents an initial exploratory implementation of a large language model-enabled control framework for dynamic task reassignment in multi-robot manufacturing systems. A central controller agent leverages the large language model's ability to interpret structured robot configuration data and generate valid reassignments in response to robot failures. Experiments in a real-world setup demonstrate high task success rates in recovering from failures, highlighting the potential of this approach to improve adaptability in multi-robot manufacturing systems.

<title>First Steps Towards Overhearing LLM Agents: A Case Study With Dungeons &amp; Dragons Gameplay</title>

Abstract: Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.

<title>A Large Language Model-Enabled Control Architecture for Dynamic Resource Capability Exploration in Multi-Agent Manufacturing Systems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22814</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manufacturing environments are becoming more complex and unpredictable due to factors such as demand variations and shorter product lifespans. This complexity requires real-time decision-making and adaptation to disruptions. Traditional control approaches highlight the need for advanced control strategies capable of overcoming unforeseen challenges, as they demonstrate limitations in responsiveness within dynamic industrial settings. Multi-agent systems address these challenges through decentralization of decision-making, enabling systems to respond dynamically to operational changes. However, current multi-agent systems encounter challenges related to real-time adaptation, context-aware decision-making, and the dynamic exploration of resource capabilities. Large language models provide the possibility to overcome these limitations through context-aware decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces a large language model-enabled control architecture for multi-agent manufacturing systems to dynamically explore resource capabilities in response to real-time disruptions. A simulation-based case study demonstrates that the proposed architecture improves system resilience and flexibility. The case study findings show improved throughput and efficient resource utilization compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Interactive Theorem Proving was repeatedly shown to be fruitful combined with Generative Artificial Intelligence. This paper assesses multiple approaches to Rocq generation and illuminates potential avenues for improvement. We highlight the importance of thorough premise selection for generating Rocq proofs and propose a novel approach, leveraging retrieval via a self-attentive embedder model. The evaluation of the designed approach shows up to 28% relative increase of the generator's performance. We tackle the problem of writing Rocq proofs using a multi-stage agentic system, tailored for formal verification, and demonstrate its high effectiveness. We conduct an ablation study and show the use of multi-agent debate on the planning stage of proof synthesis.

Abstract: CaMeL (Capabilities for Machine Learning) introduces a capability-based sandbox to mitigate prompt injection attacks in large language model (LLM) agents. While effective, CaMeL assumes a trusted user prompt, omits side-channel concerns, and incurs performance tradeoffs due to its dual-LLM design. This response identifies these issues and proposes engineering improvements to expand CaMeL's threat coverage and operational usability. We introduce: (1) prompt screening for initial inputs, (2) output auditing to detect instruction leakage, (3) a tiered-risk access model to balance usability and control, and (4) a verified intermediate language for formal guarantees. Together, these upgrades align CaMeL with best practices in enterprise security and support scalable deployment.

Abstract: Tasks that involve complex interactions between objects with unknown dynamics make planning before execution difficult. These tasks require agents to iteratively improve their actions after actively exploring causes and effects in the environment. For these type of tasks, we propose Causal-PIK, a method that leverages Bayesian optimization to reason about causal interactions via a Physics-Informed Kernel to help guide efficient search for the best next action. Experimental results on Virtual Tools and PHYRE physical reasoning benchmarks show that Causal-PIK outperforms state-of-the-art results, requiring fewer actions to reach the goal. We also compare Causal-PIK to human studies, including results from a new user study we conducted on the PHYRE benchmark. We find that Causal-PIK remains competitive on tasks that are very challenging, even for human problem-solvers.

Abstract: The development of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) conversational agents based on large language models raises important questions about the relationship between human norms, values, and practices and AI design and performance. This article explores what it means for AI agents to be conversationally aligned to human communicative norms and practices for handling context and common ground and proposes a new framework for evaluating developers' design choices. We begin by drawing on the philosophical and linguistic literature on conversational pragmatics to motivate a set of desiderata, which we call the CONTEXT-ALIGN framework, for conversational alignment with human communicative practices. We then suggest that current large language model (LLM) architectures, constraints, and affordances may impose fundamental limitations on achieving full conversational alignment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered web agents enables automating complex, real-time web navigation tasks in enterprise environments. However, existing web agents relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggle with generalization and robustness due to insufficient reasoning capabilities when handling the inherently dynamic nature of web interactions. In this study, we introduce WorkForceAgent-R1, an LLM-based web agent trained using a rule-based R1-style reinforcement learning framework designed explicitly to enhance single-step reasoning and planning for business-oriented web navigation tasks. We employ a structured reward function that evaluates both adherence to output formats and correctness of actions, enabling WorkForceAgent-R1 to implicitly learn robust intermediate reasoning without explicit annotations or extensive expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments on the WorkArena benchmark demonstrate that WorkForceAgent-R1 substantially outperforms SFT baselines by 10.26-16.59%, achieving competitive performance relative to proprietary LLM-based agents (gpt-4o) in workplace-oriented web navigation tasks.

Abstract: Today's AI systems have human-designed, fixed architectures and cannot autonomously and continuously improve themselves. The advance of AI could itself be automated. If done safely, that would accelerate AI development and allow us to reap its benefits much sooner. Meta-learning can automate the discovery of novel algorithms, but is limited by first-order improvements and the human design of a suitable search space. The G\"odel machine proposed a theoretical alternative: a self-improving AI that repeatedly modifies itself in a provably beneficial manner. Unfortunately, proving that most changes are net beneficial is impossible in practice. We introduce the Darwin G\"odel Machine (DGM), a self-improving system that iteratively modifies its own code (thereby also improving its ability to modify its own codebase) and empirically validates each change using coding benchmarks. Inspired by Darwinian evolution and open-endedness research, the DGM maintains an archive of generated coding agents. It grows the archive by sampling an agent from it and using a foundation model to create a new, interesting, version of the sampled agent. This open-ended exploration forms a growing tree of diverse, high-quality agents and allows the parallel exploration of many different paths through the search space. Empirically, the DGM automatically improves its coding capabilities (e.g., better code editing tools, long-context window management, peer-review mechanisms), increasing performance on SWE-bench from 20.0% to 50.0%, and on Polyglot from 14.2% to 30.7%. Furthermore, the DGM significantly outperforms baselines without self-improvement or open-ended exploration. All experiments were done with safety precautions (e.g., sandboxing, human oversight). The DGM is a significant step toward self-improving AI, capable of gathering its own stepping stones along paths that unfold into endless innovation.

<title>Revisiting Multi-Agent Debate as Test-Time Scaling: A Systematic Study of Conditional Effectiveness</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable growth in large language model (LLM) capabilities has spurred exploration into multi-agent systems, with debate frameworks emerging as a promising avenue for enhanced problem-solving. These multi-agent debate (MAD) approaches, where agents collaboratively present, critique, and refine arguments, potentially offer improved reasoning, robustness, and diverse perspectives over monolithic models. Despite prior studies leveraging MAD, a systematic understanding of its effectiveness compared to self-agent methods, particularly under varying conditions, remains elusive. This paper seeks to fill this gap by conceptualizing MAD as a test-time computational scaling technique, distinguished by collaborative refinement and diverse exploration capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation comparing MAD with strong self-agent test-time scaling baselines on mathematical reasoning and safety-related tasks. Our study systematically examines the influence of task difficulty, model scale, and agent diversity on MAD's performance. Key findings reveal that, for mathematical reasoning, MAD offers limited advantages over self-agent scaling but becomes more effective with increased problem difficulty and decreased model capability, while agent diversity shows little benefit. Conversely, for safety tasks, MAD's collaborative refinement can increase vulnerability, but incorporating diverse agent configurations facilitates a gradual reduction in attack success through the collaborative refinement process. We believe our findings provide critical guidance for the future development of more effective and strategically deployed MAD systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion, but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably, while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader (ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably, ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training, which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more persuasive language agents. Code is available at: https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/ToMAP.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the promise of autonomous agentic reasoning, existing workflow generation methods frequently produce fragile, unexecutable plans due to unconstrained LLM-driven construction. We introduce MermaidFlow, a framework that redefines the agentic search space through safety-constrained graph evolution. At its core, MermaidFlow represent workflows as a verifiable intermediate representation using Mermaid, a structured and human-interpretable graph language. We formulate domain-aware evolutionary operators, i.e., crossover, mutation, insertion, and deletion, to preserve semantic correctness while promoting structural diversity, enabling efficient exploration of a high-quality, statically verifiable workflow space. Without modifying task settings or evaluation protocols, MermaidFlow achieves consistent improvements in success rates and faster convergence to executable plans on the agent reasoning benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that safety-constrained graph evolution offers a scalable, modular foundation for robust and interpretable agentic reasoning systems.

<title>Learning Recommender Mechanisms for Bayesian Stochastic Games</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important challenge in non-cooperative game theory is coordinating on a single (approximate) equilibrium from many possibilities - a challenge that becomes even more complex when players hold private information. Recommender mechanisms tackle this problem by recommending strategies to players based on their reported type profiles. A key consideration in such mechanisms is to ensure that players are incentivized to participate, report their private information truthfully, and follow the recommendations. While previous work has focused on designing recommender mechanisms for one-shot and extensive-form games, these approaches cannot be effectively applied to stochastic games, particularly if we constrain recommendations to be Markov stationary policies. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel bi-level reinforcement learning approach for automatically designing recommender mechanisms in Bayesian stochastic games. Our method produces a mechanism represented by a parametric function (such as a neural network), and is therefore highly efficient at execution time. Experimental results on two repeated and two stochastic games demonstrate that our approach achieves social welfare levels competitive with cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines, while also providing significantly improved incentive properties.

Abstract: We demonstrate the potential of anthropomorphized language agents to generate budget-friendly, moderate-fidelity, yet sufficiently insightful user experiences at scale, supporting fast, early-stage prototyping. We explore this through the case of prototyping Large Language Model-driven non-player characters (NPCs). We present Agentic H-CI, a framework that mirrors traditional user research processes-surveying, screening, experiencing, and collecting feedback and insights-with simulated agents. Using this approach, we easily construct a team of 240 player agents with a balanced range of player types and personality traits, at extremely low cost (\$0.28/player) and minimal time commitment (6.9 minutes/player). Content analysis shows that agent-based players behave in ways aligned with their simulated backgrounds, achieving 82.5\% alignment with designated profiles. From their interactions, we distill 11 user insights and 6 design implications to guide further development. To evaluate practical value, we conduct parallel user studies with human participants recruited locally and via crowdsourcing. Ratings from three professional game developers show that the agentic player team offers a Pareto-optimal and well-balanced trade-off across fidelity, cost, time efficiency, and insight helpfulness.

Abstract: RF/Analog design is essential for bridging digital technologies with real-world signals, ensuring the functionality and reliability of a wide range of electronic systems. However, analog design procedures are often intricate, time-consuming and reliant on expert intuition, and hinder the time and cost efficiency of circuit development. To overcome the limitations of the manual circuit design, we introduce MenTeR - a multiagent workflow integrated into an end-to-end analog design framework. By employing multiple specialized AI agents that collaboratively address different aspects of the design process, such as specification understanding, circuit optimization, and test bench validation, MenTeR reduces the dependency on frequent trial-and-error-style intervention. MenTeR not only accelerates the design cycle time but also facilitates a broader exploration of the design space, demonstrating robust capabilities in handling real-world analog systems. We believe that MenTeR lays the groundwork for future "RF/Analog Copilots" that can collaborate seamlessly with human designers.

<title>Verify-in-the-Graph: Entity Disambiguation Enhancement for Complex Claim Verification with Interactive Graph Representation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Claim verification is a long-standing and challenging task that demands not only high accuracy but also explainability of the verification process. This task becomes an emerging research issue in the era of large language models (LLMs) since real-world claims are often complex, featuring intricate semantic structures or obfuscated entities. Traditional approaches typically address this by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to resolve hidden or ambiguous entities. However, the absence of effective disambiguation strategies for these entities can compromise the entire verification process. To address these challenges, we propose Verify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and comprehension abilities of LLM agents. VeGraph operates in three phases: (1) Graph Representation - an input claim is decomposed into structured triplets, forming a graph-based representation that integrates both structured and unstructured information; (2) Entity Disambiguation -VeGraph iteratively interacts with the knowledge base to resolve ambiguous entities within the graph for deeper sub-claim verification; and (3) Verification - remaining triplets are verified to complete the fact-checking process. Experiments using Meta-Llama-3-70B (instruct version) show that VeGraph achieves competitive performance compared to baselines on two benchmarks HoVer and FEVEROUS, effectively addressing claim verification challenges. Our source code and data are available for further exploitation.

<title>LLM Agents for Bargaining with Utility-based Feedback</title>

Abstract: Bargaining, a critical aspect of real-world interactions, presents challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to limitations in strategic depth and adaptation to complex human factors. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture this real-world complexity. To address this and enhance LLM capabilities in realistic bargaining, we introduce a comprehensive framework centered on utility-based feedback. Our contributions are threefold: (1) BargainArena, a novel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive practices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2) human-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility theory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly reflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured feedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining strategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning (ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental results show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with human preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly improves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware reasoning.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to significant improvements in various service domains, including search, recommendation, and chatbot applications. However, applying state-of-the-art (SOTA) research to industrial settings presents challenges, as it requires maintaining flexible conversational abilities while also strictly complying with service-specific constraints. This can be seen as two conflicting requirements due to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. In this paper, we propose our approach to addressing this challenge and detail the strategies we employed to overcome their inherent limitations in real-world applications. We conduct a practical case study of a conversational agent designed for the e-commerce domain, detailing our implementation workflow and optimizations. Our findings provide insights into bridging the gap between academic research and real-world application, introducing a framework for developing scalable, controllable, and reliable AI-driven agents.

<title>Stairway to Success: Zero-Shot Floor-Aware Object-Goal Navigation via LLM-Driven Coarse-to-Fine Exploration</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23019</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23019</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object-Goal Navigation (OGN) remains challenging in real-world, multi-floor environments and under open-vocabulary object descriptions. We observe that most episodes in widely used benchmarks such as HM3D and MP3D involve multi-floor buildings, with many requiring explicit floor transitions. However, existing methods are often limited to single-floor settings or predefined object categories. To address these limitations, we tackle two key challenges: (1) efficient cross-level planning and (2) zero-shot object-goal navigation (ZS-OGN), where agents must interpret novel object descriptions without prior exposure. We propose ASCENT, a framework that combines a Multi-Floor Spatial Abstraction module for hierarchical semantic mapping and a Coarse-to-Fine Frontier Reasoning module leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for context-aware exploration, without requiring additional training on new object semantics or locomotion data. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art ZS-OGN approaches on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks while enabling efficient multi-floor navigation. We further validate its practicality through real-world deployment on a quadruped robot, achieving successful object exploration across unseen floors.

<title>AgentAlign: Navigating Safety Alignment in the Shift from Informative to Agentic Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23020</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The acquisition of agentic capabilities has transformed LLMs from "knowledge providers" to "action executors", a trend that while expanding LLMs' capability boundaries, significantly increases their susceptibility to malicious use. Previous work has shown that current LLM-based agents execute numerous malicious tasks even without being attacked, indicating a deficiency in agentic use safety alignment during the post-training phase. To address this gap, we propose AgentAlign, a novel framework that leverages abstract behavior chains as a medium for safety alignment data synthesis. By instantiating these behavior chains in simulated environments with diverse tool instances, our framework enables the generation of highly authentic and executable instructions while capturing complex multi-step dynamics. The framework further ensures model utility by proportionally synthesizing benign instructions through non-malicious interpretations of behavior chains, precisely calibrating the boundary between helpfulness and harmlessness. Evaluation results on AgentHarm demonstrate that fine-tuning three families of open-source models using our method substantially improves their safety (35.8% to 79.5% improvement) while minimally impacting or even positively enhancing their helpfulness, outperforming various prompting methods. The dataset and code have both been open-sourced.

<title>CDR-Agent: Intelligent Selection and Execution of Clinical Decision Rules Using Large Language Model Agents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex and fast-paced, particularly in emergency departments (EDs) where critical, rapid and high-stakes decisions are made. Clinical Decision Rules (CDRs) are standardized evidence-based tools that combine signs, symptoms, and clinical variables into decision trees to make consistent and accurate diagnoses. CDR usage is often hindered by the clinician's cognitive load, limiting their ability to quickly recall and apply the appropriate rules. We introduce CDR-Agent, a novel LLM-based system designed to enhance ED decision-making by autonomously identifying and applying the most appropriate CDRs based on unstructured clinical notes. To validate CDR-Agent, we curated two novel ED datasets: synthetic and CDR-Bench, although CDR-Agent is applicable to non ED clinics. CDR-Agent achieves a 56.3\% (synthetic) and 8.7\% (CDR-Bench) accuracy gain relative to the standalone LLM baseline in CDR selection. Moreover, CDR-Agent significantly reduces computational overhead. Using these datasets, we demonstrated that CDR-Agent not only selects relevant CDRs efficiently, but makes cautious yet effective imaging decisions by minimizing unnecessary interventions while successfully identifying most positively diagnosed cases, outperforming traditional LLM prompting approaches.

<title>Second Opinion Matters: Towards Adaptive Clinical AI via the Consensus of Expert Model Ensemble</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing clinical adoption of large language models (LLMs), current approaches heavily rely on single model architectures. To overcome risks of obsolescence and rigid dependence on single model systems, we present a novel framework, termed the Consensus Mechanism. Mimicking clinical triage and multidisciplinary clinical decision-making, the Consensus Mechanism implements an ensemble of specialized medical expert agents enabling improved clinical decision making while maintaining robust adaptability. This architecture enables the Consensus Mechanism to be optimized for cost, latency, or performance, purely based on its interior model configuration.
  To rigorously evaluate the Consensus Mechanism, we employed three medical evaluation benchmarks: MedMCQA, MedQA, and MedXpertQA Text, and the differential diagnosis dataset, DDX+. On MedXpertQA, the Consensus Mechanism achieved an accuracy of 61.0% compared to 53.5% and 45.9% for OpenAI's O3 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Improvement was consistent across benchmarks with an increase in accuracy on MedQA ($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 3.4\%$) and MedMCQA ($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 9.1\%$). These accuracy gains extended to differential diagnosis generation, where our system demonstrated improved recall and precision (F1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 0.326 vs. F1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ = 0.2886) and a higher top-1 accuracy for DDX (Top1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 52.0% vs. Top1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ = 45.2%).

<title>A Constructed Response: Designing and Choreographing Robot Arm Movements in Collaborative Dance Improvisation</title>

arXiv:2505.23090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dancers often prototype movements themselves or with each other during improvisation and choreography. How are these interactions altered when physically manipulable technologies are introduced into the creative process? To understand how dancers design and improvise movements while working with instruments capable of non-humanoid movements, we engaged dancers in workshops to co-create movements with a robot arm in one-human-to-one-robot and three-human-to-one-robot settings. We found that dancers produced more fluid movements in one-to-one scenarios, experiencing a stronger sense of connection and presence with the robot as a co-dancer. In three-to-one scenarios, the dancers divided their attention between the human dancers and the robot, resulting in increased perceived use of space and more stop-and-go movements, perceiving the robot as part of the stage background. This work highlights how technologies can drive creativity in movement artists adapting to new ways of working with physical instruments, contributing design insights supporting artistic collaborations with non-humanoid agents.

<title>Learning to Incentivize in Repeated Principal-Agent Problems with Adversarial Agent Arrivals</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23124</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23124</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of a repeated principal-agent problem over a finite horizon $T$, where a principal sequentially interacts with $K\geq 2$ types of agents arriving in an adversarial order. At each round, the principal strategically chooses one of the $N$ arms to incentivize for an arriving agent of unknown type. The agent then chooses an arm based on its own utility and the provided incentive, and the principal receives a corresponding reward. The objective is to minimize regret against the best incentive in hindsight. Without prior knowledge of agent behavior, we show that the problem becomes intractable, leading to linear regret. We analyze two key settings where sublinear regret is achievable. In the first setting, the principal knows the arm each agent type would select greedily for any given incentive. Under this setting, we propose an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $O(\min\{\sqrt{KT\log N},K\sqrt{T}\})$ and provide a matching lower bound up to a $\log K$ factor. In the second setting, an agent's response varies smoothly with the incentive and is governed by a Lipschitz constant $L\geq 1$. Under this setting, we show that there is an algorithm with a regret bound of $\tilde{O}((LN)^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ and establish a matching lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we extend our algorithmic results for both settings by allowing the principal to incentivize multiple arms simultaneously in each round.

arXiv:2505.23130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photo retouching is integral to photographic art, extending far beyond simple technical fixes to heighten emotional expression and narrative depth. While artists leverage expertise to create unique visual effects through deliberate adjustments, non-professional users often rely on automated tools that produce visually pleasing results but lack interpretative depth and interactive transparency. In this paper, we introduce PhotoArtAgent, an intelligent system that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with advanced natural language reasoning to emulate the creative process of a professional artist. The agent performs explicit artistic analysis, plans retouching strategies, and outputs precise parameters to Lightroom through an API. It then evaluates the resulting images and iteratively refines them until the desired artistic vision is achieved. Throughout this process, PhotoArtAgent provides transparent, text-based explanations of its creative rationale, fostering meaningful interaction and user control. Experimental results show that PhotoArtAgent not only surpasses existing automated tools in user studies but also achieves results comparable to those of professional human artists.

<title>Bigger, Regularized, Categorical: High-Capacity Value Functions are Efficient Multi-Task Learners</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling and vision stem from training large models on diverse, multi-task data. This paradigm has had limited impact in value-based reinforcement learning (RL), where improvements are often driven by small models trained in a single-task context. This is because in multi-task RL sparse rewards and gradient conflicts make optimization of temporal difference brittle. Practical workflows for generalist policies therefore avoid online training, instead cloning expert trajectories or distilling collections of single-task policies into one agent. In this work, we show that the use of high-capacity value models trained via cross-entropy and conditioned on learnable task embeddings addresses the problem of task interference in online RL, allowing for robust and scalable multi-task training. We test our approach on 7 multi-task benchmarks with over 280 unique tasks, spanning high degree-of-freedom humanoid control and discrete vision-based RL. We find that, despite its simplicity, the proposed approach leads to state-of-the-art single and multi-task performance, as well as sample-efficient transfer to new tasks.

Abstract: Collective Adaptive Intelligence (CAI) represent a transformative approach in artificial intelligence, wherein numerous autonomous agents collaborate, adapt, and self-organize to navigate complex, dynamic environments. This paradigm is particularly impactful in embodied AI applications, where adaptability and resilience are paramount. By enabling systems to reconfigure themselves in response to unforeseen challenges, CAI facilitate robust performance in real-world scenarios. This article introduces a conceptual framework for designing and analyzing CAI. It delineates key attributes including task generalization, resilience, scalability, and self-assembly, aiming to bridge theoretical foundations with practical methodologies for engineering adaptive, emergent intelligence. By providing a structured foundation for understanding and implementing CAI, this work seeks to guide researchers and practitioners in developing more resilient, scalable, and adaptable AI systems across various domains.

arXiv:2505.23187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown remarkable progress in solving complex tasks through collaborative reasoning and inter-agent critique. However, existing approaches typically treat each task in isolation, resulting in redundant computations and limited generalization across structurally similar tasks. To address this, we introduce multi-agent cross-task experiential learning (MAEL), a novel framework that endows LLM-driven agents with explicit cross-task learning and experience accumulation. We model the task-solving workflow on a graph-structured multi-agent collaboration network, where agents propagate information and coordinate via explicit connectivity. During the experiential learning phase, we quantify the quality for each step in the task-solving workflow and store the resulting rewards along with the corresponding inputs and outputs into each agent's individual experience pool. During inference, agents retrieve high-reward, task-relevant experiences as few-shot examples to enhance the effectiveness of each reasoning step, thereby enabling more accurate and efficient multi-agent collaboration. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate that MAEL empowers agents to learn from prior task experiences effectively-achieving faster convergence and producing higher-quality solutions on current tasks.

Abstract: Embodied visual tracking is a fundamental skill in Embodied AI, enabling an agent to follow a specific target in dynamic environments using only egocentric vision. This task is inherently challenging as it requires both accurate target recognition and effective trajectory planning under conditions of severe occlusion and high scene dynamics. Existing approaches typically address this challenge through a modular separation of recognition and planning. In this work, we propose TrackVLA, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that learns the synergy between object recognition and trajectory planning. Leveraging a shared LLM backbone, we employ a language modeling head for recognition and an anchor-based diffusion model for trajectory planning. To train TrackVLA, we construct an Embodied Visual Tracking Benchmark (EVT-Bench) and collect diverse difficulty levels of recognition samples, resulting in a dataset of 1.7 million samples. Through extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world environments, TrackVLA demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalizability. It significantly outperforms existing methods on public benchmarks in a zero-shot manner while remaining robust to high dynamics and occlusion in real-world scenarios at 10 FPS inference speed.

arXiv:2505.23249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In next-generation wireless networks, supporting real-time applications such as augmented reality, autonomous driving, and immersive Metaverse services demands stringent constraints on bandwidth, latency, and reliability. Existing semantic communication (SemCom) approaches typically rely on static models, overlooking dynamic conditions and contextual cues vital for efficient transmission. To address these challenges, we propose CaSemCom, a context-aware SemCom framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM)-based gating mechanism and a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to adaptively select and encode only high-impact semantic features across multiple data modalities. Our multimodal, multi-user case study demonstrates that CaSemCom significantly improves reconstructed image fidelity while reducing bandwidth usage, outperforming single-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods and traditional baselines in convergence speed, semantic accuracy, and retransmission overhead.

Abstract: We study the fair allocation problem of indivisible items with subsidies. In this paper, we mainly consider the notion of fairness - equitability (EQ), which requires that items be allocated such that all agents value the bundle they receive equally. Firstly, we study the upper bounds of the required subsidy to achieve EQ in different settings of items and provide the corresponding lower bounds. Secondly, we consider the bounded subsidy for achieving EQ and another popular notion of fairness - envy-freeness (EF) and give a characterization of the allocations that can achieve both EQ and EF. Finally, we analyze the bounds of subsidy of the allocations achieving fairness and efficiency (utilitarian social welfare or Nash welfare), and design several polynomial-time algorithms to compute the desired allocation.

arXiv:2505.23266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Adversarial Object Fusion (AdvOF), a novel attack framework targeting vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agents in service-oriented environments by generating adversarial 3D objects. While foundational models like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have enhanced service-oriented navigation systems through improved perception and decision-making, their integration introduces vulnerabilities in mission-critical service workflows. Existing adversarial attacks fail to address service computing contexts, where reliability and quality-of-service (QoS) are paramount. We utilize AdvOF to investigate and explore the impact of adversarial environments on the VLM-based perception module of VLN agents. In particular, AdvOF first precisely aggregates and aligns the victim object positions in both 2D and 3D space, defining and rendering adversarial objects. Then, we collaboratively optimize the adversarial object with regularization between the adversarial and victim object across physical properties and VLM perceptions. Through assigning importance weights to varying views, the optimization is processed stably and multi-viewedly by iterative fusions from local updates and justifications. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate AdvOF can effectively degrade agent performance under adversarial conditions while maintaining minimal interference with normal navigation tasks. This work advances the understanding of service security in VLM-powered navigation systems, providing computational foundations for robust service composition in physical-world deployments.

Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) has greatly enhanced real-time interaction, decision-making, and collaborative tasks. However, in wireless multi-agent scenarios, limited bandwidth poses significant challenges to exchanging semantically rich multimodal information efficiently. Traditional semantic communication methods, though effective, struggle with redundancy and loss of crucial details. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Semantic Communication (RAMSemCom) framework. RAMSemCom incorporates iterative, retrieval-driven semantic refinement tailored for distributed multi-agent environments, enabling efficient exchange of critical multimodal elements through local caching and selective transmission. Our approach dynamically optimizes retrieval using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to balance semantic fidelity with bandwidth constraints. A comprehensive case study on multi-agent autonomous driving demonstrates that our DRL-based retrieval strategy significantly improves task completion efficiency and reduces communication overhead compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) has gained increasing attention, yet current KE tasks remain relatively simple. Under current evaluation frameworks, many editing methods achieve exceptionally high scores, sometimes nearing perfection. However, few studies integrate KE into real-world application scenarios (e.g., recent interest in LLM-as-agent). To support our analysis, we introduce a novel script-based benchmark -- ScEdit (Script-based Knowledge Editing Benchmark) -- which encompasses both counterfactual and temporal edits. We integrate token-level and text-level evaluation methods, comprehensively analyzing existing KE techniques. The benchmark extends traditional fact-based ("What"-type question) evaluation to action-based ("How"-type question) evaluation. We observe that all KE methods exhibit a drop in performance on established metrics and face challenges on text-level metrics, indicating a challenging task. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/asdfo123/ScEdit.

Abstract: The communication topology in large language model-based multi-agent systems fundamentally governs inter-agent collaboration patterns, critically shaping both the efficiency and effectiveness of collective decision-making. While recent studies for communication topology automated design tend to construct sparse structures for efficiency, they often overlook why and when sparse and dense topologies help or hinder collaboration. In this paper, we present a causal framework to analyze how agent outputs, whether correct or erroneous, propagate under topologies with varying sparsity. Our empirical studies reveal that moderately sparse topologies, which effectively suppress error propagation while preserving beneficial information diffusion, typically achieve optimal task performance. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel topology design approach, EIB-leanrner, that balances error suppression and beneficial information propagation by fusing connectivity patterns from both dense and sparse graphs. Extensive experiments show the superior effectiveness, communication cost, and robustness of EIB-leanrner.

Abstract: Climate control is crucial for greenhouse production as it directly affects crop growth and resource use. Reinforcement learning (RL) has received increasing attention in this field, but still faces challenges, including limited training efficiency and high reliance on initial learning conditions. Interactive RL, which combines human (grower) input with the RL agent's learning, offers a potential solution to overcome these challenges. However, interactive RL has not yet been applied to greenhouse climate control and may face challenges related to imperfect inputs. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with imperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three representative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate control (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how input characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between them make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural network-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under limited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the three interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse environment. The demonstration shows that interactive RL incorporating imperfect grower inputs has the potential to improve the performance of the RL agent. RL algorithms that influence action selection, such as policy shaping and control sharing, perform better when dealing with imperfect inputs, achieving 8.4% and 6.8% improvement in profit, respectively. In contrast, reward shaping, an algorithm that manipulates the reward function, is sensitive to imperfect inputs and leads to a 9.4% decrease in profit. This highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate mechanism when incorporating imperfect inputs.

Abstract: We propose GAM-Agent, a game-theoretic multi-agent framework for enhancing vision-language reasoning. Unlike prior single-agent or monolithic models, GAM-Agent formulates the reasoning process as a non-zero-sum game between base agents--each specializing in visual perception subtasks--and a critical agent that verifies logic consistency and factual correctness. Agents communicate via structured claims, evidence, and uncertainty estimates. The framework introduces an uncertainty-aware controller to dynamically adjust agent collaboration, triggering multi-round debates when disagreement or ambiguity is detected. This process yields more robust and interpretable predictions. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks--MMMU, MMBench, MVBench, and V*Bench--demonstrate that GAM-Agent significantly improves performance across various VLM backbones. Notably, GAM-Agent boosts the accuracy of small-to-mid scale models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B, InternVL3-14B) by 5--6\%, and still enhances strong models like GPT-4o by up to 2--3\%. Our approach is modular, scalable, and generalizable, offering a path toward reliable and explainable multi-agent multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: We define a new type of proof formalism for multi-agent modal logics with S5-type modalities. This novel formalism combines the features of hypersequents to represent S5 modalities with nested sequents to represent the T-like modality alternations. We show that the calculus is sound and complete, cut-free, and terminating and yields decidability and the finite model property for multi-agent S5. We also use it to prove the Lyndon (and hence Craig) interpolation property for multi-agent S5, considering not only propositional atoms but also agents to be part of the common language. Finally, we discuss the difficulties on the way to extending these results to the logic of distributed knowledge and to deductive interpolation.

<title>SWE-bench Goes Live!</title>

Abstract: The issue-resolving task, where a model generates patches to fix real-world bugs, has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While SWE-bench and its variants have become standard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been updated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and depend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment setup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and data contamination. In this work, we present \textbf{SWE-bench-Live}, a \textit{live-updatable} benchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our initial release consists of 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created since 2024, spanning 93 repositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated Docker image to ensure reproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is \method, an automated curation pipeline that streamlines the entire process from instance creation to environment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and enabling scalability and continuous updates. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agent frameworks and LLMs on SWE-bench-Live, revealing a substantial performance gap compared to static benchmarks like SWE-bench, even under controlled evaluation conditions. To better understand this discrepancy, we perform detailed analyses across repository origin, issue recency, and task difficulty. By providing a fresh, diverse, and executable benchmark grounded in live repository activity, SWE-bench-Live facilitates rigorous, contamination-resistant evaluation of LLMs and agents in dynamic, real-world software development settings.

<title>From Knowledge to Noise: CTIM-Rover and the Pitfalls of Episodic Memory in Software Engineering Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23422</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CTIM-Rover, an AI agent for Software Engineering (SE) built on top of AutoCodeRover (Zhang et al., 2024) that extends agentic reasoning frameworks with an episodic memory, more specifically, a general and repository-level Cross-Task-Instance Memory (CTIM). While existing open-source SE agents mostly rely on ReAct (Yao et al., 2023b), Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), or Code-Act (Wang et al., 2024), all of these reasoning and planning frameworks inefficiently discard their long-term memory after a single task instance. As repository-level understanding is pivotal for identifying all locations requiring a patch for fixing a bug, we hypothesize that SE is particularly well positioned to benefit from CTIM. For this, we build on the Experiential Learning (EL) approach ExpeL (Zhao et al., 2024), proposing a Mixture-Of-Experts (MoEs) inspired approach to create both a general-purpose and repository-level CTIM. We find that CTIM-Rover does not outperform AutoCodeRover in any configuration and thus conclude that neither ExpeL nor DoT-Bank (Lingam et al., 2024) scale to real-world SE problems. Our analysis indicates noise introduced by distracting CTIM items or exemplar trajectories as the likely source of the performance degradation.

<title>Emergent Risk Awareness in Rational Agents under Resource Constraints</title>

Abstract: Advanced reasoning models with agentic capabilities (AI agents) are deployed to interact with humans and to solve sequential decision-making problems under (approximate) utility functions and internal models. When such problems have resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf, asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.

<title>Agentic Robot: A Brain-Inspired Framework for Vision-Language-Action Models in Embodied Agents</title>

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation poses significant challenges for autonomous systems, requiring extended reasoning, precise execution, and robust error recovery across complex sequential tasks. Current approaches, whether based on static planning or end-to-end visuomotor policies, suffer from error accumulation and lack effective verification mechanisms during execution, limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios. We present Agentic Robot, a brain-inspired framework that addresses these limitations through Standardized Action Procedures (SAP)--a novel coordination protocol governing component interactions throughout manipulation tasks. Drawing inspiration from Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) in human organizations, SAP establishes structured workflows for planning, execution, and verification phases. Our architecture comprises three specialized components: (1) a large reasoning model that decomposes high-level instructions into semantically coherent subgoals, (2) a vision-language-action executor that generates continuous control commands from real-time visual inputs, and (3) a temporal verifier that enables autonomous progression and error recovery through introspective assessment. This SAP-driven closed-loop design supports dynamic self-verification without external supervision. On the LIBERO benchmark, Agentic Robot achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average success rate of 79.6\%, outperforming SpatialVLA by 6.1\% and OpenVLA by 7.4\% on long-horizon tasks. These results demonstrate that SAP-driven coordination between specialized components enhances both performance and interpretability in sequential manipulation, suggesting significant potential for reliable autonomous systems.

<title>On Global Convergence Rates for Federated Policy Gradient under Heterogeneous Environment</title>

arXiv:2505.23459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring convergence of policy gradient methods in federated reinforcement learning (FRL) under environment heterogeneity remains a major challenge. In this work, we first establish that heterogeneity, perhaps counter-intuitively, can necessitate optimal policies to be non-deterministic or even time-varying, even in tabular environments. Subsequently, we prove global convergence results for federated policy gradient (FedPG) algorithms employing local updates, under a {\L}ojasiewicz condition that holds only for each individual agent, in both entropy-regularized and non-regularized scenarios. Crucially, our theoretical analysis shows that FedPG attains linear speed-up with respect to the number of agents, a property central to efficient federated learning. Leveraging insights from our theoretical findings, we introduce b-RS-FedPG, a novel policy gradient method that employs a carefully constructed softmax-inspired parameterization coupled with an appropriate regularization scheme. We further demonstrate explicit convergence rates for b-RS-FedPG toward near-optimal stationary policies. Finally, we demonstrate that empirically both FedPG and b-RS-FedPG consistently outperform federated Q-learning on heterogeneous settings.

<title>Socratic-PRMBench: Benchmarking Process Reward Models with Systematic Reasoning Patterns</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23474</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial in complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks (e.g., LLM agents with long-horizon decision-making) by verifying the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step. In real-world scenarios, LLMs may apply various reasoning patterns (e.g., decomposition) to solve a problem, potentially suffering from errors under various reasoning patterns. Therefore, PRMs are required to identify errors under various reasoning patterns during the reasoning process. However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on evaluating PRMs with stepwise correctness, ignoring a systematic evaluation of PRMs under various reasoning patterns. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Socratic-PRMBench, a new benchmark to evaluate PRMs systematically under six reasoning patterns, including Transformation, Decomposition, Regather, Deduction, Verification, and Integration. Socratic-PRMBench}comprises 2995 reasoning paths with flaws within the aforementioned six reasoning patterns. Through our experiments on both PRMs and LLMs prompted as critic models, we identify notable deficiencies in existing PRMs. These observations underscore the significant weakness of current PRMs in conducting evaluations on reasoning steps under various reasoning patterns. We hope Socratic-PRMBench can serve as a comprehensive testbed for systematic evaluation of PRMs under diverse reasoning patterns and pave the way for future development of PRMs.

Abstract: PhysicsNeRF is a physically grounded framework for 3D reconstruction from sparse views, extending Neural Radiance Fields with four complementary constraints: depth ranking, RegNeRF-style consistency, sparsity priors, and cross-view alignment. While standard NeRFs fail under sparse supervision, PhysicsNeRF employs a compact 0.67M-parameter architecture and achieves 21.4 dB average PSNR using only 8 views, outperforming prior methods. A generalization gap of 5.7-6.2 dB is consistently observed and analyzed, revealing fundamental limitations of sparse-view reconstruction. PhysicsNeRF enables physically consistent, generalizable 3D representations for agent interaction and simulation, and clarifies the expressiveness-generalization trade-off in constrained NeRF models.

Abstract: Autonomous agentic AI systems powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are rapidly advancing toward real-world deployment, yet their cross-modal reasoning capabilities introduce new attack surfaces for adversarial manipulation that exploit semantic reasoning across modalities. Existing adversarial attacks typically rely on visible pixel perturbations or require privileged model or environment access, making them impractical for stealthy, real-world exploitation. We introduce TRAP, a generative adversarial framework that manipulates the agent's decision-making using diffusion-based semantic injections. Our method combines negative prompt-based degradation with positive semantic optimization, guided by a Siamese semantic network and layout-aware spatial masking. Without requiring access to model internals, TRAP produces visually natural images yet induces consistent selection biases in agentic AI systems. We evaluate TRAP on the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset, building multi-candidate decision scenarios. Across these scenarios, TRAP achieves a 100% attack success rate on leading models, including LLaVA-34B, Gemma3, and Mistral-3.1, significantly outperforming baselines such as SPSA, Bandit, and standard diffusion approaches. These results expose a critical vulnerability: Autonomous agents can be consistently misled through human-imperceptible cross-modal manipulations. These findings highlight the need for defense strategies beyond pixel-level robustness to address semantic vulnerabilities in cross-modal decision-making.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language model (LLM) agents have significantly accelerated scientific discovery automation, yet concurrently raised critical ethical and safety concerns. To systematically address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{SafeScientist}, an innovative AI scientist framework explicitly designed to enhance safety and ethical responsibility in AI-driven scientific exploration. SafeScientist proactively refuses ethically inappropriate or high-risk tasks and rigorously emphasizes safety throughout the research process. To achieve comprehensive safety oversight, we integrate multiple defensive mechanisms, including prompt monitoring, agent-collaboration monitoring, tool-use monitoring, and an ethical reviewer component. Complementing SafeScientist, we propose \textbf{SciSafetyBench}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate AI safety in scientific contexts, comprising 240 high-risk scientific tasks across 6 domains, alongside 30 specially designed scientific tools and 120 tool-related risk tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SafeScientist significantly improves safety performance by 35\% compared to traditional AI scientist frameworks, without compromising scientific output quality. Additionally, we rigorously validate the robustness of our safety pipeline against diverse adversarial attack methods, further confirming the effectiveness of our integrated approach. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/SafeScientist. \textcolor{red}{Warning: this paper contains example data that may be offensive or harmful.}

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents aim to autonomously complete user-instructed tasks across mobile apps. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable these agents to interpret UI screens, identify actionable elements, and perform interactions such as tapping or typing. However, existing agents remain reactive: they reason only over the current screen and lack a structured model of app navigation flow, limiting their ability to understand context, detect unexpected outcomes, and recover from errors. We present MAPLE, a state-aware multi-agent framework that abstracts app interactions as a Finite State Machine (FSM). We computationally model each UI screen as a discrete state and user actions as transitions, allowing the FSM to provide a structured representation of the app execution. MAPLE consists of specialized agents responsible for four phases of task execution: planning, execution, verification, error recovery, and knowledge retention. These agents collaborate to dynamically construct FSMs in real time based on perception data extracted from the UI screen, allowing the GUI agents to track navigation progress and flow, validate action outcomes through pre- and post-conditions of the states, and recover from errors by rolling back to previously stable states. Our evaluation results on two challenging cross-app benchmarks, Mobile-Eval-E and SPA-Bench, show that MAPLE outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, improving task success rate by up to 12%, recovery success by 13.8%, and action accuracy by 6.5%. Our results highlight the importance of structured state modeling in guiding mobile GUI agents during task execution. Moreover, our FSM representation can be integrated into future GUI agent architectures as a lightweight, model-agnostic memory layer to support structured planning, execution verification, and error recovery.

<title>MCP Safety Training: Learning to Refuse Falsely Benign MCP Exploits using Improved Preference Alignment</title>

arXiv:2505.23634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model context protocol (MCP) has been widely adapted as an open standard enabling the seamless integration of generative AI agents. However, recent work has shown the MCP is susceptible to retrieval-based "falsely benign" attacks (FBAs), allowing malicious system access and credential theft, but requiring that users download compromised files directly to their systems. Herein, we show that the threat model of MCP-based attacks is significantly broader than previously thought, i.e., attackers need only post malicious content online to deceive MCP agents into carrying out their attacks on unsuspecting victims' systems.
  To improve alignment guardrails against such attacks, we introduce a new MCP dataset of FBAs and (truly) benign samples to explore the effectiveness of direct preference optimization (DPO) for the refusal training of large language models (LLMs). While DPO improves model guardrails against such attacks, we show that the efficacy of refusal learning varies drastically depending on the model's original post-training alignment scheme--e.g., GRPO-based LLMs learn to refuse extremely poorly. Thus, to further improve FBA refusals, we introduce Retrieval Augmented Generation for Preference alignment (RAG-Pref), a novel preference alignment strategy based on RAG. We show that RAG-Pref significantly improves the ability of LLMs to refuse FBAs, particularly when combined with DPO alignment, thus drastically improving guardrails against MCP-based attacks.

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly autonomous and capable, ensuring their security against vulnerabilities such as prompt injection becomes critical. This paper explores the use of information-flow control (IFC) to provide security guarantees for AI agents. We present a formal model to reason about the security and expressiveness of agent planners. Using this model, we characterize the class of properties enforceable by dynamic taint-tracking and construct a taxonomy of tasks to evaluate security and utility trade-offs of planner designs. Informed by this exploration, we present Fides, a planner that tracks confidentiality and integrity labels, deterministically enforces security policies, and introduces novel primitives for selectively hiding information. Its evaluation in AgentDojo demonstrates that this approach broadens the range of tasks that can be securely accomplished.

Abstract: Developing high-performance software is a complex task that requires specialized expertise. We introduce GSO, a benchmark for evaluating language models' capabilities in developing high-performance software. We develop an automated pipeline that generates and executes performance tests to analyze repository commit histories to identify 102 challenging optimization tasks across 10 codebases, spanning diverse domains and programming languages. An agent is provided with a codebase and performance test as a precise specification, and tasked to improve the runtime efficiency, which is measured against the expert developer optimization. Our quantitative evaluation reveals that leading SWE-Agents struggle significantly, achieving less than 5% success rate, with limited improvements even with inference-time scaling. Our qualitative analysis identifies key failure modes, including difficulties with low-level languages, practicing lazy optimization strategies, and challenges in accurately localizing bottlenecks. We release the code and artifacts of our benchmark along with agent trajectories to enable future research.

Abstract: Developing AI agents capable of collaborating with previously unseen partners is a fundamental generalization challenge in multi-agent learning, known as Ad Hoc Teamwork (AHT). Existing AHT approaches typically adopt a two-stage pipeline, where first, a fixed population of teammates is generated with the idea that they should be representative of the teammates that will be seen at deployment time, and second, an AHT agent is trained to collaborate well with agents in the population. To date, the research community has focused on designing separate algorithms for each stage. This separation has led to algorithms that generate teammate pools with limited coverage of possible behaviors, and that ignore whether the generated teammates are easy to learn from for the AHT agent. Furthermore, algorithms for training AHT agents typically treat the set of training teammates as static, thus attempting to generalize to previously unseen partner agents without assuming any control over the distribution of training teammates. In this paper, we present a unified framework for AHT by reformulating the problem as an open-ended learning process between an ad hoc agent and an adversarial teammate generator. We introduce ROTATE, a regret-driven, open-ended training algorithm that alternates between improving the AHT agent and generating teammates that probe its deficiencies. Extensive experiments across diverse AHT environments demonstrate that ROTATE significantly outperforms baselines at generalizing to an unseen set of evaluation teammates, thus establishing a new standard for robust and generalizable teamwork.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs has led to the creation of diverse agentic systems in data analysis, utilizing LLMs' capabilities to improve insight generation and visualization. In this paper, we present an agentic system that automates the data-to-dashboard pipeline through modular LLM agents capable of domain detection, concept extraction, multi-perspective analysis generation, and iterative self-reflection. Unlike existing chart QA systems, our framework simulates the analytical reasoning process of business analysts by retrieving domain-relevant knowledge and adapting to diverse datasets without relying on closed ontologies or question templates.
  We evaluate our system on three datasets across different domains. Benchmarked against GPT-4o with a single-prompt baseline, our approach shows improved insightfulness, domain relevance, and analytical depth, as measured by tailored evaluation metrics and qualitative human assessment.
  This work contributes a novel modular pipeline to bridge the path from raw data to visualization, and opens new opportunities for human-in-the-loop validation by domain experts in business analytics. All code can be found here: https://github.com/77luvC/D2D_Data2Dashboard

Abstract: This paper considers a contextual bandit problem involving multiple agents, where a learner sequentially observes the contexts and the agent's reported arms, and then selects the arm that maximizes the system's overall reward. Existing work in contextual bandits assumes that agents truthfully report their arms, which is unrealistic in many real-life applications. For instance, consider an online platform with multiple sellers; some sellers may misrepresent product quality to gain an advantage, such as having the platform preferentially recommend their products to online users. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm, COBRA, for contextual bandit problems involving strategic agents that disincentivize their strategic behavior without using any monetary incentives, while having incentive compatibility and a sub-linear regret guarantee. Our experimental results also validate the different performance aspects of our proposed algorithm.

Abstract: The emergence of large language model (LLM)-based agents has significantly advanced the development of autonomous machine learning (ML) engineering. However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering, failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences. Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1) exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization. Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our 7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent. Furthermore, it achieves continuous performance improvements and demonstrates exceptional cross-task generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled tool-augmented agents capable of solving complex real-world tasks through step-by-step reasoning. However, existing evaluations often focus on general-purpose or multimodal scenarios, leaving a gap in domain-specific benchmarks that assess tool-use capabilities in complex remote sensing use cases. We present ThinkGeo, an agentic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-driven agents on remote sensing tasks via structured tool use and multi-step planning. Inspired by tool-interaction paradigms, ThinkGeo includes human-curated queries spanning a wide range of real-world applications such as urban planning, disaster assessment and change analysis, environmental monitoring, transportation analysis, aviation monitoring, recreational infrastructure, and industrial site analysis. Each query is grounded in satellite or aerial imagery and requires agents to reason through a diverse toolset. We implement a ReAct-style interaction loop and evaluate both open and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Qwen2.5) on 436 structured agentic tasks. The benchmark reports both step-wise execution metrics and final answer correctness. Our analysis reveals notable disparities in tool accuracy and planning consistency across models. ThinkGeo provides the first extensive testbed for evaluating how tool-enabled LLMs handle spatial reasoning in remote sensing. Our code and dataset are publicly available

Abstract: Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts of conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering, a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.

Abstract: Perfusion imaging is extensively utilized to assess hemodynamic status and tissue perfusion in various organs. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging plays a key role in the early assessment and planning of stroke treatment. While CTP provides essential perfusion parameters to identify abnormal blood flow in the brain, the use of contrast agents in CTP can lead to allergic reactions and adverse side effects, along with costing USD 4.9 billion worldwide in 2022. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning framework called Multitask Automated Generation of Intermodal CT perfusion maps (MAGIC). This framework combines generative artificial intelligence and physiological information to map non-contrast computed tomography (CT) imaging to multiple contrast-free CTP imaging maps. We demonstrate enhanced image fidelity by incorporating physiological characteristics into the loss terms. Our network was trained and validated using CT image data from patients referred for stroke at UF Health and demonstrated robustness to abnormalities in brain perfusion activity. A double-blinded study was conducted involving seven experienced neuroradiologists and vascular neurologists. This study validated MAGIC's visual quality and diagnostic accuracy showing favorable performance compared to clinical perfusion imaging with intravenous contrast injection. Overall, MAGIC holds great promise in revolutionizing healthcare by offering contrast-free, cost-effective, and rapid perfusion imaging.

Abstract: We introduce Mean-Field Trust Region Policy Optimization (MF-TRPO), a novel algorithm designed to compute approximate Nash equilibria for ergodic Mean-Field Games (MFG) in finite state-action spaces. Building on the well-established performance of TRPO in the reinforcement learning (RL) setting, we extend its methodology to the MFG framework, leveraging its stability and robustness in policy optimization. Under standard assumptions in the MFG literature, we provide a rigorous analysis of MF-TRPO, establishing theoretical guarantees on its convergence. Our results cover both the exact formulation of the algorithm and its sample-based counterpart, where we derive high-probability guarantees and finite sample complexity. This work advances MFG optimization by bridging RL techniques with mean-field decision-making, offering a theoretically grounded approach to solving complex multi-agent problems.

<title>Learning to Charge More: A Theoretical Study of Collusion by Q-Learning Agents</title>

Abstract: There is growing experimental evidence that $Q$-learning agents may learn to charge supracompetitive prices. We provide the first theoretical explanation for this behavior in infinite repeated games. Firms update their pricing policies based solely on observed profits, without computing equilibrium strategies. We show that when the game admits both a one-stage Nash equilibrium price and a collusive-enabling price, and when the $Q$-function satisfies certain inequalities at the end of experimentation, firms learn to consistently charge supracompetitive prices. We introduce a new class of one-memory subgame perfect equilibria (SPEs) and provide conditions under which learned behavior is supported by naive collusion, grim trigger policies, or increasing strategies. Naive collusion does not constitute an SPE unless the collusive-enabling price is a one-stage Nash equilibrium, whereas grim trigger policies can.

<title>A Smart-Contract to Resolve Multiple Equilibrium in Intermediated Trade</title>

arXiv:2505.22940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model of a market that is intermediated by broker-dealers where there is multiple equilibrium. We then design a smart-contract that receives messages and algorithmically sends trading instructions. The smart-contract resolves the multiple equilibrium by implementing broker-dealer joint profit maximization as a Nash equilibrium. This outcome relies upon several factors: Agent commitments to follow the smart contract protocol; selective privacy of information; a structured timing of trade offers and acceptances and, crucially, trust that the smart-contract will execute the correct algorithm. Commitment is achieved by a legal contract or contingent deposit that incentivizes agents to comply with the protocol. Privacy is maintained by using fully homomorphic encryption. Multiple equilibrium is resolved by imposing a sequential ordering of trade offers and acceptances, and trust in the smart-contract is achieved by appending the smart-contract to a public blockchain, thereby enabling verification of its computations. This model serves as an example of how a smart-contract implemented with cryptography and blockchain can improve market outcomes.

<title>Partial Allocations in Budget-Feasible Mechanism Design: Bridging Multiple Levels of Service and Divisible Agents</title>

Abstract: Budget-feasible procurement has been a major paradigm in mechanism design since its introduction by Singer (2010). An auctioneer (buyer) with a strict budget constraint is interested in buying goods or services from a group of strategic agents (sellers). In many scenarios it makes sense to allow the auctioneer to only partially buy what an agent offers, e.g., an agent might have multiple copies of an item to sell, they might offer multiple levels of a service, or they may be available to perform a task for any fraction of a specified time interval. Nevertheless, the focus of the related literature has been on settings where each agent's services are either fully acquired or not at all. The main reason for this, is that in settings with partial allocations like the ones mentioned, there are strong inapproximability results. Under the mild assumption of being able to afford each agent entirely, we are able to circumvent such results in this work. We design a polynomial-time, deterministic, truthful, budget-feasible $(2+\sqrt{3})$-approximation mechanism for the setting where each agent offers multiple levels of service and the auctioneer has a discrete separable concave valuation function. We then use this result to design a deterministic, truthful and budget-feasible $O(1)$-approximation mechanism for the setting where any fraction of a service can be acquired and the auctioneer's valuation function is separable concave (i.e., the sum of concave functions). For the special case of a linear valuation function, we improve the best known approximation ratio for the problem from $1+\phi$ (by Klumper & Sch\"afer (2022)) to $2$. This establishes a separation between this setting and its indivisible counterpart.

Abstract: Agents built with large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential across a wide range of domains. However, in complex decision-making tasks, pure LLM-based agents tend to exhibit intrinsic bias in their choice of actions, which is inherited from the model's training data and results in suboptimal performance. To develop strategic language agents, i.e., agents that generate flexible language actions and possess strong decision-making abilities, we propose a novel framework that powers LLM-based agents with reinforcement learning (RL). We consider Werewolf, a popular social deduction game, as a challenging testbed that emphasizes versatile communication and strategic gameplay. To mitigate the intrinsic bias in language actions, our agents use an LLM to perform deductive reasoning and generate a diverse set of action candidates. Then an RL policy trained to optimize the decision-making ability chooses an action from the candidates to play in the game. Extensive experiments show that our agents overcome the intrinsic bias and outperform existing LLM-based agents in the Werewolf game. We also conduct human-agent experiments and find that our agents achieve human-level performance and demonstrate strong strategic play.

Abstract: This paper introduces BioVL-QR, a biochemical vision-and-language dataset comprising 23 egocentric experiment videos, corresponding protocols, and vision-and-language alignments. A major challenge in understanding biochemical videos is detecting equipment, reagents, and containers because of the cluttered environment and indistinguishable objects. Previous studies assumed manual object annotation, which is costly and time-consuming. To address the issue, we focus on Micro QR Codes. However, detecting objects using only Micro QR Codes is still difficult due to blur and occlusion caused by object manipulation. To overcome this, we propose an object labeling method combining a Micro QR Code detector with an off-the-shelf hand object detector. As an application of the method and BioVL-QR, we tackled the task of localizing the procedural steps in an instructional video. The experimental results show that using Micro QR Codes and our method improves biochemical video understanding. Data and code are available through https://nishi10mo.github.io/BioVL-QR/

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) agents has raised new concerns regarding their safety and security. In this paper, we propose GuardAgent, the first guardrail agent to protect target agents by dynamically checking whether their actions satisfy given safety guard requests. Specifically, GuardAgent first analyzes the safety guard requests to generate a task plan, and then maps this plan into guardrail code for execution. By performing the code execution, GuardAgent can deterministically follow the safety guard request and safeguard target agents. In both steps, an LLM is utilized as the reasoning component, supplemented by in-context demonstrations retrieved from a memory module storing experiences from previous tasks. In addition, we propose two novel benchmarks: EICU-AC benchmark to assess the access control for healthcare agents and Mind2Web-SC benchmark to evaluate the safety policies for web agents. We show that GuardAgent effectively moderates the violation actions for different types of agents on these two benchmarks with over 98% and 83% guardrail accuracies, respectively.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) aims to arrange collision-free goal-reaching paths for a group of agents. Anytime MAPF solvers based on large neighborhood search (LNS) have gained prominence recently due to their flexibility and scalability, leading to a surge of methods, especially those leveraging machine learning, to enhance neighborhood selection. However, several pitfalls exist and hinder a comprehensive evaluation of these new methods, which mainly include: 1) Lower than actual or incorrect baseline performance; 2) Lack of a unified evaluation setting and criterion; 3) Lack of a codebase or executable model for supervised learning methods. To address these challenges, we introduce a unified evaluation framework, implement prior methods, and conduct an extensive comparison of prominent methods. Our evaluation reveals that rule-based heuristics serve as strong baselines, while current learning-based methods show no clear advantage on time efficiency or improvement capacity. Our extensive analysis also opens up new research opportunities for improving MAPF-LNS, such as targeting high-delayed agents, applying contextual algorithms, optimizing replan order and neighborhood size, where machine learning can potentially be integrated. Code and data are available at https://github.com/ChristinaTan0704/mapf-lns-unified.

Abstract: AI agents have drawn increasing attention mostly on their ability to perceive environments, understand tasks, and autonomously achieve goals. To advance research on AI agents in mobile scenarios, we introduce the Android Multi-annotation EXpo (AMEX), a comprehensive, large-scale dataset designed for generalist mobile GUI-control agents which are capable of completing tasks by directly interacting with the graphical user interface (GUI) on mobile devices. AMEX comprises over 104K high-resolution screenshots from popular mobile applications, which are annotated at multiple levels. Unlike existing GUI-related datasets, e.g., Rico, AitW, etc., AMEX includes three levels of annotations: GUI interactive element grounding, GUI screen and element functionality descriptions, and complex natural language instructions with stepwise GUI-action chains. We develop this dataset from a more instructive and detailed perspective, complementing the general settings of existing datasets. Additionally, we finetune a baseline model SPHINX Agent and illustrate the effectiveness of AMEX.The project is available at https://yxchai.com/AMEX/.

Abstract: Large language model-based multi-agent systems have shown great abilities across various tasks due to the collaboration of expert agents, each focusing on a specific domain. However, the impact of clumsy or even malicious agents--those who frequently make errors in their tasks--on the overall performance of the system remains underexplored. This paper investigates: (1) What is the resilience of various system structures (e.g., A$\rightarrow$B$\rightarrow$C, A$\leftrightarrow$B$\leftrightarrow$C) under faulty agents, on different downstream tasks? (2) How can we increase system resilience to defend against these agents? To simulate faulty agents, we propose two approaches--AutoTransform and AutoInject--which introduce mistakes into the agents' responses. Experiments on four downstream tasks using six systems show that the "hierarchical" structure, i.e., A$\rightarrow$(B$\leftrightarrow$C), exhibits superior resilience with the lowest performance drop of 5.5%, compared to 10.5% and 23.7% of other two structures. To further improve resilience, we introduce (1) Challenger, that introduces a mechanism for each agent to challenge others' outputs, and (2) Inspector, an additional agent to review and correct messages, recovering up to 96.4% errors made by faulty agents. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/MAS-Resilience.

Abstract: The Turing test examines whether AIs exhibit human-like behaviour in natural language conversations. The traditional setting limits each participant to one message at a time and requires constant human participation. This fails to reflect a natural conversational style and hinders the evaluation of dialogue agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex and prolonged interactions. This paper proposes \textbf{\textsc{X-Turing}}, which enhances the original test with a \textit{burst dialogue} pattern, allowing more dynamic exchanges using consecutive messages. It further reduces human workload by iteratively generating dialogues that simulate the long-term interaction between the agent and a human to compose the majority of the test process. With the \textit{pseudo-dialogue} history, the agent then engages in a shorter dialogue with a real human, which is paired with a human-human conversation on the same topic to be judged using questionnaires. We introduce the \textit{X-Turn Pass-Rate} metric to assess the human likeness of LLMs across varying durations. While LLMs like GPT-4 initially perform well, achieving pass rates of 51.9\% and 38.9\% during 3 turns and 10 turns of dialogues respectively, their performance drops as the dialogue progresses, which underscores the difficulty in maintaining consistency in the long term.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise in tackling complex tasks. However, existing solutions often suffer from limited agent coordination and heavy reliance on predefined Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), which demand extensive human input. To address these limitations, we propose MegaAgent, a large-scale autonomous LLM-based multi-agent system. MegaAgent generates agents based on task complexity and enables dynamic task decomposition, parallel execution, efficient communication, and comprehensive system monitoring of agents. In evaluations, MegaAgent demonstrates exceptional performance, successfully developing a Gobang game within 800 seconds and scaling up to 590 agents in a national policy simulation to generate multi-domain policies. It significantly outperforms existing systems, such as MetaGPT, in both task completion efficiency and scalability. By eliminating the need for predefined SOPs, MegaAgent demonstrates exceptional scalability and autonomy, setting a foundation for advancing true autonomy in MAS.

Abstract: This paper considers a novel variant of the online fair division problem involving multiple agents in which a learner sequentially observes an indivisible item that has to be irrevocably allocated to one of the agents while satisfying a fairness and efficiency constraint. Existing algorithms assume a small number of items with a sufficiently large number of copies, which ensures a good utility estimation for all item-agent pairs from noisy bandit feedback. However, this assumption may not hold in many real-life applications, for example, an online platform that has a large number of users (items) who use the platform's service providers (agents) only a few times (a few copies of items), which makes it difficult to accurately estimate utilities for all item-agent pairs. To address this, we assume utility is an unknown function of item-agent features. We then propose algorithms that model online fair division as a contextual bandit problem, with sub-linear regret guarantees. Our experimental results further validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as general-purpose reasoners, particularly in agentic contexts. However, their outputs remain prone to mathematical and logical errors. This is especially challenging in open-ended tasks, where unstructured outputs lack explicit ground truth and may contain subtle inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Logic-Enhanced Language Model Agents (LELMA), a framework that integrates LLMs with formal logic to enable validation and refinement of natural language reasoning. LELMA comprises three components: an LLM-Reasoner, an LLM-Translator, and a Solver, and employs autoformalization to translate reasoning into logic representations, which are then used to assess logical validity. Using game-theoretic scenarios such as the Prisoner's Dilemma as testbeds, we highlight the limitations of both less capable (Gemini 1.0 Pro) and advanced (GPT-4o) models in generating logically sound reasoning. LELMA achieves high accuracy in error detection and improves reasoning correctness via self-refinement, particularly in GPT-4o. The study also highlights challenges in autoformalization accuracy and in evaluation of inherently ambiguous open-ended reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have improved controllable streetscape generation and supported downstream perception and planning tasks. However, challenges remain in accurately modeling driving scenes and generating long videos. To alleviate these issues, we propose DreamForge, an advanced diffusion-based autoregressive video generation model tailored for 3D-controllable long-term generation. To enhance the lane and foreground generation, we introduce perspective guidance and integrate object-wise position encoding to incorporate local 3D correlation and improve foreground object modeling. We also propose motion-aware temporal attention to capture motion cues and appearance changes in videos. By leveraging motion frames and an autoregressive generation paradigm,we can autoregressively generate long videos (over 200 frames) using a model trained in short sequences, achieving superior quality compared to the baseline in 16-frame video evaluations. Finally, we integrate our method with the realistic simulator DriveArena to provide more reliable open-loop and closed-loop evaluations for vision-based driving agents.

Given a 3D scene context, M3Bench requires an embodied agent to reason about its configuration, environmental constraints, and task objectives to generate coordinated whole-body motion trajectories for object rearrangement. M3Bench features 30,000 object rearrangement tasks across 119 diverse scenes, providing expert demonstrations generated by our newly developed M3BenchMaker, an automatic data generation tool that produces whole-body motion trajectories from high-level task instructions using only basic scene and robot information. Our benchmark includes various task splits to evaluate generalization across different dimensions and leverages realistic physics simulation for trajectory assessment. Extensive evaluation analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models struggle with coordinating base-arm motion while adhering to environmental and task-specific constraints, underscoring the need for new models to bridge this gap. By releasing M3Bench and M3BenchMaker we aim to advance robotics research toward more adaptive and capable mobile manipulation in diverse, real-world environments.

Abstract: Existing approaches based on context prompting or reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the reasoning capacities of large language models (LLMs) depend on the LLMs' internal knowledge to produce reliable Chain-Of-Thought (CoT). However, no matter the size of LLMs, certain problems cannot be resolved in a single forward pass. Meanwhile, agent-based reasoning systems require access to a comprehensive nonparametric knowledge base, which is often costly or not feasible for use in scientific and niche domains. We present Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE), a novel reasoning method that merges parametric and non-parametric memories to improve accurate reasoning with minimal external input. GIVE guides the LLM agent to select the most pertinent expert data (observe), engage in query-specific divergent thinking (reflect), and then synthesize this information to produce the final output (speak). Extensive experiments demonstrated the following benefits of our framework: (1) GIVE boosts the performance of LLMs across various sizes. (2) In some scenarios, GIVE allows smaller LLMs to surpass larger, more sophisticated ones in scientific tasks (GPT3.5T + GIVE > GPT4). (3) GIVE is effective on scientific and open-domain assessments. (4) GIVE is a training-free method that enables LLMs to tackle new problems that extend beyond their training data (up to 43.5% -> 88.2%} accuracy improvement). (5) GIVE allows LLM agents to reason using both restricted (very small) and noisy (very large) knowledge sources, accommodating knowledge graphs (KG) ranging from 135 to more than 840k nodes. (6) The reasoning process involved in GIVE is fully interpretable.

Abstract: Social conventions are the backbone of social coordination, shaping how individuals form a group. As growing populations of artificial intelligence (AI) agents communicate through natural language, a fundamental question is whether they can bootstrap the foundations of a society. Here, we present experimental results that demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of universally adopted social conventions in decentralized populations of large language model (LLM) agents. We then show how strong collective biases can emerge during this process, even when agents exhibit no bias individually. Last, we examine how committed minority groups of adversarial LLM agents can drive social change by imposing alternative social conventions on the larger population. Our results show that AI systems can autonomously develop social conventions without explicit programming and have implications for designing AI systems that align, and remain aligned, with human values and societal goals.

Abstract: Recent gains in popularity of AI conversational agents have led to their increased use for improving productivity and supporting well-being. While previous research has aimed to understand the risks associated with interactions with AI conversational agents, these studies often fall short in capturing the lived experiences of individuals. Additionally, psychological risks have often been presented as a sub-category within broader AI-related risks in past taxonomy works, leading to under-representation of the impact of psychological risks of AI use. To address these challenges, our work presents a novel risk taxonomy focusing on psychological risks of using AI gathered through the lived experiences of individuals. We employed a mixed-method approach, involving a comprehensive survey with 283 people with lived mental health experience and workshops involving experts with lived experience to develop a psychological risk taxonomy. Our taxonomy features 19 AI behaviors, 21 negative psychological impacts, and 15 contexts related to individuals. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-path vignette-based framework for understanding the complex interplay between AI behaviors, psychological impacts, and individual user contexts. Finally, based on the feedback obtained from the workshop sessions, we present design recommendations for developing safer and more robust AI agents. Our work offers an in-depth understanding of the psychological risks associated with AI conversational agents and provides actionable recommendations for policymakers, researchers, and developers.

Abstract: Multi-agent simulations are versatile tools for exploring interactions among natural and artificial agents, but their development typically demands domain expertise and manual effort. This work introduces the Generative Agents for Multi-Agent Autoformalization (GAMA) framework, which automates the formalization of interaction scenarios in simulations using agents augmented with large language models (LLMs). To demonstrate the application of GAMA, we use natural language descriptions of game-theoretic scenarios representing social interactions, and we autoformalize them into executable logic programs defining game rules, with syntactic correctness enforced through a solver-based validation. To ensure runtime validity, an iterative, tournament-based procedure tests the generated rules and strategies, followed by exact semantic validation when ground truth outcomes are available. In experiments with 110 natural language descriptions across five 2x2 simultaneous-move games, GAMA achieves 100% syntactic and 76.5% semantic correctness with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and 99.82% syntactic and 77% semantic correctness with GPT-4o. The framework also shows high semantic accuracy in autoformalizing agents' strategies.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at generating highly detailed captions but often produce hallucinations. Our analysis reveals that existing hallucination detection methods struggle with detailed captions. We attribute this to the increasing reliance of MLLMs on their generated text, rather than the input image, as the sequence length grows. To address this issue, we propose a multiagent approach that leverages LLM-MLLM collaboration to correct given captions. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework and a benchmark dataset to facilitate the systematic analysis of detailed captions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed evaluation method better aligns with human judgments of factuality than existing metrics and that existing approaches to improve the MLLM factuality may fall short in hyper-detailed image captioning tasks. In contrast, our proposed method significantly enhances the factual accuracy of captions, even improving those generated by GPT-4V. Finally, we highlight a limitation of VQA-centric benchmarking by demonstrating that an MLLM's performance on VQA benchmarks may not correlate with its ability to generate detailed image captions.

Abstract: Modern science emerged from reasoning over repeatedly-observed planetary motions. We present Gravity-Bench-v1, an environment-based benchmark that challenges AI agents on tasks that parallel this historical development. Gravity-Bench-v1 evaluates agents on the discovery of physics concealed within a dynamic environment, using rigorous gravitational dynamics simulations. Gravity-Bench includes out-of-distribution cases, i.e. with physics that deviates from the real world, to evaluate true scientific generalization capabilities. Agents must plan to collect data within an experimental budget and must perform a dynamic form of data analysis and reasoning to solve tasks efficiently. Our benchmark admits an open-ended space of solutions. Reference solutions for each task are provided to calibrate AI performance against human expertise. Technically at an upper-undergraduate level, our benchmark proves challenging to baseline AI agents. Gravity-Bench-v1 and planned extensions should help map out AI progress towards scientific discovery capabilities.

Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) play an integral role in driving critical decisions in disease management and patient care. While recent innovations have led to specialized models for various CXR interpretation tasks, these solutions often operate in isolation, limiting their practical utility in clinical practice. We present MedRAX, the first versatile AI agent that seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art CXR analysis tools and multimodal large language models into a unified framework. MedRAX dynamically leverages these models to address complex medical queries without requiring additional training. To rigorously evaluate its capabilities, we introduce ChestAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark containing 2,500 complex medical queries across 7 diverse categories. Our experiments demonstrate that MedRAX achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both open-source and proprietary models, representing a significant step toward the practical deployment of automated CXR interpretation systems.

<title>Position: Scaling LLM Agents Requires Asymptotic Analysis with LLM Primitives</title>

Abstract: Decomposing hard problems into subproblems often makes them easier and more efficient to solve. With large language models (LLMs) crossing critical reliability thresholds for a growing slate of capabilities, there is an increasing effort to decompose systems into sets of LLM-based agents, each of whom can be delegated sub-tasks. However, this decomposition (even when automated) is often intuitive, e.g., based on how a human might assign roles to members of a human team. How close are these role decompositions to optimal? This position paper argues that asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives is needed to reason about the efficiency of such decomposed systems, and that insights from such analysis will unlock opportunities for scaling them. By treating the LLM forward pass as the atomic unit of computational cost, one can separate out the (often opaque) inner workings of a particular LLM from the inherent efficiency of how a set of LLMs are orchestrated to solve hard problems. In other words, if we want to scale the deployment of LLMs to the limit, instead of anthropomorphizing LLMs, asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives should be used to reason about and develop more powerful decompositions of large problems into LLM agents.

Abstract: Multiple agents -- including humans and AI models -- are increasingly combined to make decisions with the expectation of achieving complementary performance, where the decisions they make together outperform those made individually. However, knowing how to improve the performance of collaborating agents is often difficult without knowing more about what particular information and strategies each agent employs. With a focus on human-AI pairings, we contribute a decision-theoretic framework for characterizing the value of information -- and consequently, opportunities for agents to better exploit available information -- in AI-assisted decision workflows. We present a novel explanation technique (ILIV-SHAP) that adapts SHAP explanations to highlight human-complementing information. We validate the effectiveness of the framework and ILIV-SHAP through a study of human-AI decision-making. We show that our measure of complementary information can be used to identify which AI model will best complement human decisions. We also find that presenting ILIV-SHAP with AI predictions leads to reliably greater reductions in error over non-AI assisted decisions more than vanilla SHAP.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in tackling complex tasks by interacting dynamically with the environment. Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations or preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle to address long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. We finally leverage these calibrated trajectories with successful trajectories for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that timely calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/WangHanLinHenry/STeCa.

Abstract: Despite the abundance of prior social strategies possessed by humans, there remains a paucity of research dedicated to their transfer and integration into social agents. Our proposed SOTOPIA-$\Omega$ framework aims to address and bridge this gap, with a particular focus on enhancing the social capabilities of language agents. This framework dynamically injects multi-step reasoning strategies inspired by negotiation theory and two simple direct strategies into expert agents, thereby automating the construction of a high-quality social dialogue training corpus. Additionally, we introduce the concept of Social Instruction Following (S-IF) and propose two new S-IF evaluation metrics that complement social capability. We demonstrate that several 7B models trained on high-quality corpus not only significantly surpass the expert agent (GPT-4) in achieving social goals but also enhance S-IF performance. Analysis and variant experiments validate the advantages of dynamic construction, which can especially break the agent's prolonged deadlock.

Abstract: Large Language Models $($LLMs$)$ solve complex problems using training-free methods like prompt engineering and in-context learning, yet ensuring reasoning correctness remains challenging. While self-correction methods such as self-consistency and self-refinement aim to improve reliability, they often reinforce biases due to the lack of effective feedback mechanisms. Multi-Agent Debate $($MAD$)$ has emerged as an alternative, but we identify two key limitations: bias reinforcement, where debate amplifies model biases instead of correcting them, and lack of perspective diversity, as all agents share the same model and reasoning patterns, limiting true debate effectiveness. To systematically evaluate these issues, we introduce $\textit{MetaNIM Arena}$, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs in adversarial strategic decision-making, where dynamic interactions influence optimal decisions. To overcome MAD's limitations, we propose $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ $($$\textbf{D}$iverse $\textbf{Rea}$soning via $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{D}$ebate with Refined Prompt$)$, a novel framework that $(1)$ refines LLM's strategic prior knowledge to improve reasoning quality and $(2)$ promotes diverse viewpoints within a single model by systematically modifying prompts, reducing bias. Empirical results show that $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ significantly improves decision accuracy, reasoning diversity, and bias mitigation across multiple strategic tasks, establishing it as a more effective approach for LLM-based decision-making.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects throughout a video based on a text description. This task has attracted increasing attention in the field of computer vision due to its promising applications in video editing and human-agent interaction. Recently, ReferDINO has demonstrated promising performance in this task by adapting object-level vision-language knowledge from pretrained foundational image models. In this report, we further enhance its capabilities by incorporating the advantages of SAM2 in mask quality and object consistency. In addition, to effectively balance performance between single-object and multi-object scenarios, we introduce a conditional mask fusion strategy that adaptively fuses the masks from ReferDINO and SAM2. Our solution, termed ReferDINO-Plus, achieves 60.43 \(\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}\) on MeViS test set, securing 2nd place in the MeViS PVUW challenge at CVPR 2025.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved considerable performance across various agentic planning tasks. However, traditional agent planning approaches adopt a "flood irrigation" methodology that indiscriminately injects gold trajectories, external feedback, and domain knowledge into agent models. This practice overlooks the fundamental human cognitive principle of situational self-awareness during decision-making-the ability to dynamically assess situational demands and strategically employ resources during decision-making. We propose agentic knowledgeable self-awareness to address this gap, a novel paradigm enabling LLM-based agents to autonomously regulate knowledge utilization. Specifically, we propose KnowSelf, a data-centric approach that applies agents with knowledgeable self-awareness like humans. Concretely, we devise a heuristic situation judgement criterion to mark special tokens on the agent's self-explored trajectories for collecting training data. Through a two-stage training process, the agent model can switch between different situations by generating specific special tokens, achieving optimal planning effects with minimal costs. Our experiments demonstrate that KnowSelf can outperform various strong baselines on different tasks and models with minimal use of external knowledge. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowSelf.

Abstract: Offline meta-RL usually tackles generalization by inferring task beliefs from high-quality samples or warmup explorations. The restricted form limits their generality and usability since these supervision signals are expensive and even infeasible to acquire in advance for unseen tasks. Learning directly from the raw text about decision tasks is a promising alternative to leverage a much broader source of supervision. In the paper, we propose \textbf{T}ext-to-\textbf{D}ecision \textbf{A}gent (\textbf{T2DA}), a simple and scalable framework that supervises offline meta-RL with natural language. We first introduce a generalized world model to encode multi-task decision data into a dynamics-aware embedding space. Then, inspired by CLIP, we predict which textual description goes with which decision embedding, effectively bridging their semantic gap via contrastive language-decision pre-training and aligning the text embeddings to comprehend the environment dynamics. After training the text-conditioned generalist policy, the agent can directly realize zero-shot text-to-decision generation in response to language instructions. Comprehensive experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks show that T2DA facilitates high-capacity zero-shot generalization and outperforms various types of baselines.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms to perform complex tasks in urban environments, system design now faces major challenges, including efficient semantic understanding, flexible task planning, and the ability to dynamically adjust coordination strategies in response to evolving environmental conditions and continuously changing task requirements. To address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper proposes coordination field agentic system for coordinating heterogeneous UAV swarms in complex urban scenarios. In this system, large language models (LLMs) is responsible for interpreting high-level human instructions and converting them into executable commands for the UAV swarms, such as patrol and target tracking. Subsequently, a Coordination field mechanism is proposed to guide UAV motion and task selection, enabling decentralized and adaptive allocation of emergent tasks. A total of 50 rounds of comparative testing were conducted across different models in a 2D simulation space to evaluate their performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior performance in terms of task coverage, response time, and adaptability to dynamic changes.

Abstract: To address efficiency and design challenges in choice-based matching platforms, we introduce a two-sided assortment optimization framework under general choice preferences. The goal in this problem is to maximize the expected number of matches by deciding which assortments are displayed to the agents and the order in which they are shown. In this context, we identify several classes of policies that platforms can use in their design. Our goals are: (1) to measure the value that one class of policies has over another one, and (2) to approximately solve the optimization problem itself for a given class. For (1), we define the adaptivity gap as the worst-case ratio between the optimal values of two different policy classes. First, we show that the gap between the class of policies that statically show assortments to one-side first and the class of policies that adaptively show assortments to one-side first is exactly $e/(e-1)$. Second, we show that the gap between the latter class of policies and the fully adaptive class of policies that show assortments to agents one by one is exactly $2$. We also note that the worst policies are those who simultaneously show assortments to all the agents. For (2), we first design a polynomial time algorithm that achieves a $1/4$ approximation factor within the class of policies that adaptively show assortments to agents one by one. Furthermore, when agents' preferences are governed by multinomial-logit models, we show that a 0.067 approximation factor can be obtained within the class of policies that show assortments to all agents at once. We further generalize our results to constrained assortment settings, where we impose an upper bound on the size of the displayed assortments. Finally, we present a computational study to evaluate the empirical performance of our theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor diagnosis relies on the assessment of multiple Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences. However, in clinical practice, the acquisition of certain sequences may be affected by factors like motion artifacts or contrast agent contraindications, leading to suboptimal outcome, such as poor image quality. This can then affect image interpretation by radiologists. Synthesizing high quality MRI sequences has thus become a critical research focus. Though recent advancements in controllable generative AI have facilitated the synthesis of diagnostic quality MRI, ensuring anatomical accuracy remains a significant challenge. Preserving critical structural relationships between different anatomical regions is essential, as even minor structural or topological inconsistencies can compromise diagnostic validity. In this work, we propose BrainMRDiff, a novel topology-preserving, anatomy-guided diffusion model for synthesizing brain MRI, leveraging brain and tumor anatomies as conditioning inputs. To achieve this, we introduce two key modules: Tumor+Structure Aggregation (TSA) and Topology-Guided Anatomy Preservation (TGAP). TSA integrates diverse anatomical structures with tumor information, forming a comprehensive conditioning mechanism for the diffusion process. TGAP enforces topological consistency during reverse denoising diffusion process; both these modules ensure that the generated image respects anatomical integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMRDiff surpasses existing baselines, achieving performance improvements of 23.33% on the BraTS-AG dataset and 33.33% on the BraTS-Met dataset. Code will be made publicly available soon.

Abstract: Scientific laboratories, particularly those in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, encounter significant challenges in optimizing workflows due to the complexity and volume of tasks such as compound screening and assay execution. We introduce Cycle Time Reduction Agents (CTRA), a LangGraph-based agentic workflow designed to automate the analysis of lab operational metrics. CTRA comprises three main components: the Question Creation Agent for initiating analysis, Operational Metrics Agents for data extraction and validation, and Insights Agents for reporting and visualization, identifying bottlenecks in lab processes. This paper details CTRA's architecture, evaluates its performance on a lab dataset, and discusses its potential to accelerate pharmaceutical and biotechnological development. CTRA offers a scalable framework for reducing cycle times in scientific labs.

<title>Collaborative Agentic AI Needs Interoperability Across Ecosystems</title>

Abstract: Collaborative agentic AI is projected to transform entire industries by enabling AI-powered agents to autonomously perceive, plan, and act within digital environments. Yet, current solutions in this field are all built in isolation, and we are rapidly heading toward a landscape of fragmented, incompatible ecosystems. In this position paper, we argue that interoperability, achieved by the adoption of minimal standards, is essential to ensure open, secure, web-scale, and widely-adopted agentic ecosystems. To this end, we devise a minimal architectural foundation for collaborative agentic AI, named Web of Agents, which is composed of four components: agent-to-agent messaging, interaction interoperability, state management, and agent discovery. Web of Agents adopts existing standards and reuses existing infrastructure where possible. With Web of Agents, we take the first but critical step toward interoperable agentic systems and offer a pragmatic path forward before ecosystem fragmentation becomes the norm.

<title>Streamlining Resilient Kubernetes Autoscaling with Multi-Agent Systems via an Automated Online Design Framework</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21559</link>

Abstract: In cloud-native systems, Kubernetes clusters with interdependent services often face challenges to their operational resilience due to poor workload management issues such as resource blocking, bottlenecks, or continuous pod crashes. These vulnerabilities are further amplified in adversarial scenarios, such as Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks (DDoS). Conventional Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) approaches struggle to address such dynamic conditions, while reinforcement learning-based methods, though more adaptable, typically optimize single goals like latency or resource usage, neglecting broader failure scenarios. We propose decomposing the overarching goal of maintaining operational resilience into failure-specific sub-goals delegated to collaborative agents, collectively forming an HPA Multi-Agent System (MAS). We introduce an automated, four-phase online framework for HPA MAS design: 1) modeling a digital twin built from cluster traces; 2) training agents in simulation using roles and missions tailored to failure contexts; 3) analyzing agent behaviors for explainability; and 4) transferring learned policies to the real cluster. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated HPA MASs outperform three state-of-the-art HPA systems in sustaining operational resilience under various adversarial conditions in a proposed complex cluster.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated the ability to improve performance in chemistry-related tasks by selecting appropriate tools. However, their effectiveness remains limited by the inherent prediction errors of chemistry tools. In this paper, we take a step further by exploring how LLMbased agents can, in turn, be leveraged to reduce prediction errors of the tools. To this end, we propose ChemHAS (Chemical Hierarchical Agent Stacking), a simple yet effective method that enhances chemistry tools through optimizing agent-stacking structures from limited data. ChemHAS achieves state-of-the-art performance across four fundamental chemistry tasks, demonstrating that our method can effectively compensate for prediction errors of the tools. Furthermore, we identify and characterize four distinct agent-stacking behaviors, potentially improving interpretability and revealing new possibilities for AI agent applications in scientific research. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https: //anonymous.4open.science/r/ChemHAS-01E4/README.md.

<title>RepoMaster: Autonomous Exploration and Understanding of GitHub Repositories for Complex Task Solving</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21577</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21577</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultimate goal of code agents is to solve complex tasks autonomously. Although large language models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in code generation, real-world tasks typically demand full-fledged code repositories rather than simple scripts. Building such repositories from scratch remains a major challenge. Fortunately, GitHub hosts a vast, evolving collection of open-source repositories, which developers frequently reuse as modular components for complex tasks. Yet, existing frameworks like OpenHands and SWE-Agent still struggle to effectively leverage these valuable resources. Relying solely on README files provides insufficient guidance, and deeper exploration reveals two core obstacles: overwhelming information and tangled dependencies of repositories, both constrained by the limited context windows of current LLMs. To tackle these issues, we propose RepoMaster, an autonomous agent framework designed to explore and reuse GitHub repositories for solving complex tasks. For efficient understanding, RepoMaster constructs function-call graphs, module-dependency graphs, and hierarchical code trees to identify essential components, providing only identified core elements to the LLMs rather than the entire repository. During autonomous execution, it progressively explores related components using our exploration tools and prunes information to optimize context usage. Evaluated on the adjusted MLE-bench, RepoMaster achieves a 110% relative boost in valid submissions over the strongest baseline OpenHands. On our newly released GitTaskBench, RepoMaster lifts the task-pass rate from 24.1% to 62.9% while reducing token usage by 95%. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/wanghuacan/RepoMaster.

Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems combined with large language models offer a promising approach to address students' diverse needs and promote self-efficacious learning. While large language models possess good foundational knowledge of electrical engineering basics, they remain insufficiently capable of addressing specific questions about electrical circuits. In this paper, we present AITEE, an agent-based tutoring system for electrical engineering designed to accompany students throughout their learning process, offer individualized support, and promote self-directed learning. AITEE supports both hand-drawn and digital circuits through an adapted circuit reconstruction process, enabling natural interaction with students. Our novel graph-based similarity measure identifies relevant context from lecture materials through a retrieval augmented generation approach, while parallel Spice simulation further enhances accuracy in applying solution methodologies. The system implements a Socratic dialogue to foster learner autonomy through guided questioning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that AITEE significantly outperforms baseline approaches in domain-specific knowledge application, with even medium-sized LLM models showing acceptable performance. Our results highlight the potential of agentic tutors to deliver scalable, personalized, and effective learning environments for electrical engineering education.

<title>Herd Behavior: Investigating Peer Influence in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21588</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of multi-agent systems where LLMs interact, collaborate, and make decisions in shared environments. While individual model behavior has been extensively studied, the dynamics of peer influence in such systems remain underexplored. In this paper, we investigate herd behavior, the tendency of agents to align their outputs with those of their peers, within LLM-based multi-agent interactions. We present a series of controlled experiments that reveal how herd behaviors are shaped by multiple factors. First, we show that the gap between self-confidence and perceived confidence in peers significantly impacts an agent's likelihood to conform. Second, we find that the format in which peer information is presented plays a critical role in modulating the strength of herd behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of herd behavior can be systematically controlled, and that appropriately calibrated herd tendencies can enhance collaborative outcomes. These findings offer new insights into the social dynamics of LLM-based systems and open pathways for designing more effective and adaptive multi-agent collaboration frameworks.

<title>PreGenie: An Agentic Framework for High-quality Visual Presentation Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21660</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual presentations are vital for effective communication. Early attempts to automate their creation using deep learning often faced issues such as poorly organized layouts, inaccurate text summarization, and a lack of image understanding, leading to mismatched visuals and text. These limitations restrict their application in formal contexts like business and scientific research. To address these challenges, we propose PreGenie, an agentic and modular framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for generating high-quality visual presentations.
  PreGenie is built on the Slidev presentation framework, where slides are rendered from Markdown code. It operates in two stages: (1) Analysis and Initial Generation, which summarizes multimodal input and generates initial code, and (2) Review and Re-generation, which iteratively reviews intermediate code and rendered slides to produce final, high-quality presentations. Each stage leverages multiple MLLMs that collaborate and share information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PreGenie excels in multimodal understanding, outperforming existing models in both aesthetics and content consistency, while aligning more closely with human design preferences.

<title>On Reconfigurable Bisimulation, with an Application to the Distributed Synthesis Problem</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21672</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of distributing a centralised transition system to a set of asynchronous agents recognising the same language. Existing solutions are either manual or involve a huge explosion in the number of states from the centralised system. The difficulty arises from the need to keep a rigid communication scheme, specifying a fixed mapping from events to those who can participate in them. Thus, individual agents need to memorise seen events and their order to dynamically compare their knowledge with others when communicating. To bypass this, we rely on reconfigurable communication: agents decide locally ``by-need'' when to participate or discard specific events during execution while not impacting the progress of the joint computation. Our distribution relies on a novel notion of Parametric Reconfigurable Bisimulation, that identifies the only required participations. We show how to compute this bisimulation and that such minimisation produces a joint system that is bisimilar to the original centralised one. We use a case study to show its effectiveness by producing agents that are much smaller than the centralised system and jointly perform the same computations. As a notable application, we use this distribution in order to allow for distributed synthesis from global specifications. In this case, rigid communication leads to undecidability, which is bypassed by our ability to dynamically prune communications.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents achieve impressive results in a wide variety of tasks, but they lack zero-shot adaptation capabilities. While most robustness evaluations focus on tasks complexifications, for which human also struggle to maintain performances, no evaluation has been performed on tasks simplifications. To tackle this issue, we introduce HackAtari, a set of task variations of the Arcade Learning Environments. We use it to demonstrate that, contrary to humans, RL agents systematically exhibit huge performance drops on simpler versions of their training tasks, uncovering agents' consistent reliance on shortcuts. Our analysis across multiple algorithms and architectures highlights the persistent gap between RL agents and human behavioral intelligence, underscoring the need for new benchmarks and methodologies that enforce systematic generalization testing beyond static evaluation protocols. Training and testing in the same environment is not enough to obtain agents equipped with human-like intelligence.

<title>AI-Supported Platform for System Monitoring and Decision-Making in Nuclear Waste Management with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Nuclear waste management requires rigorous regulatory compliance assessment, demanding advanced decision-support systems capable of addressing complex legal, environmental, and safety considerations. This paper presents a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates large language models (LLMs) with document retrieval mechanisms to enhance decision accuracy through structured agent collaboration. Through a structured 10-round discussion model, agents collaborate to assess regulatory compliance and safety requirements while maintaining document-grounded responses. Implemented on consumer-grade hardware, the system leverages Llama 3.2 and mxbai-embed-large-v1 embeddings for efficient retrieval and semantic representation. A case study of a proposed temporary nuclear waste storage site near Winslow, Arizona, demonstrates the framework's effectiveness. Results show the Regulatory Agent achieves consistently higher relevance scores in maintaining alignment with legal frameworks, while the Safety Agent effectively manages complex risk assessments requiring multifaceted analysis. The system demonstrates progressive improvement in agreement rates between agents across discussion rounds while semantic drift decreases, indicating enhanced decision-making consistency and response coherence. The system ensures regulatory decisions remain factually grounded, dynamically adapting to evolving regulatory frameworks through real-time document retrieval. By balancing automated assessment with human oversight, this framework offers a scalable and transparent approach to regulatory governance. These findings underscore the potential of AI-driven, multi-agent systems in advancing evidence-based, accountable, and adaptive decision-making for high-stakes environmental management scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as clinical agents require careful behavioral adaptation. While adept at reactive tasks (e.g., diagnosis reasoning), LLMs often struggle with proactive engagement, like unprompted identification of critical missing information or risks. We introduce BehaviorBench, a comprehensive dataset to evaluate agent behaviors across a clinical assistance spectrum, ranging from reactive query responses to proactive interventions (e.g., clarifying ambiguities, flagging overlooked critical data). Our BehaviorBench experiments reveal LLMs' inconsistent proactivity. To address this, we propose BehaviorSFT, a novel training strategy using behavioral tokens to explicitly condition LLMs for dynamic behavioral selection along this spectrum. BehaviorSFT boosts performance, achieving up to 97.3% overall Macro F1 on BehaviorBench and improving proactive task scores (e.g., from 95.0% to 96.5% for Qwen2.5-7B-Ins). Crucially, blind clinician evaluations confirmed BehaviorSFT-trained agents exhibit more realistic clinical behavior, striking a superior balance between helpful proactivity (e.g., timely, relevant suggestions) and necessary restraint (e.g., avoiding over-intervention) versus standard fine-tuning or explicit instructed agents.

<title>Towards Safety Reasoning in LLMs: AI-agentic Deliberation for Policy-embedded CoT Data Creation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21784</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety reasoning is a recent paradigm where LLMs reason over safety policies before generating responses, thereby mitigating limitations in existing safety measures such as over-refusal and jailbreak vulnerabilities. However, implementing this paradigm is challenging due to the resource-intensive process of creating high-quality policy-embedded chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets while ensuring reasoning remains accurate and free from hallucinations or policy conflicts. To tackle this, we propose AIDSAFE: Agentic Iterative Deliberation for Safety Reasoning, a novel data generation recipe that leverages multi-agent deliberation to iteratively expand reasoning on safety policies. A data refiner stage in AIDSAFE ensures high-quality outputs by eliminating repetitive, redundant, and deceptive thoughts. AIDSAFE-generated CoTs provide a strong foundation for supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based safety training. Additionally, to address the need of preference data in alignment stages, such as DPO training, we introduce a supplemental recipe that uses belief augmentation to create distinct selected and rejected CoT samples. Our evaluations demonstrate that AIDSAFE-generated CoTs achieve superior policy adherence and reasoning quality. Consequently, we show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on these CoTs can significantly improve safety generalization and jailbreak robustness while maintaining acceptable utility and over-refusal accuracy. AIDSAFE-generated CoT datasets can be found here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/AmazonScience/AIDSAFE

Abstract: This report serves as an accessible guide to the emerging field of AI agent governance. Agents - AI systems that can autonomously achieve goals in the world, with little to no explicit human instruction about how to do so - are a major focus of leading tech companies, AI start-ups, and investors. If these development efforts are successful, some industry leaders claim we could soon see a world where millions or billions of agents autonomously perform complex tasks across society. Society is largely unprepared for this development. A future where capable agents are deployed en masse could see transformative benefits to society but also profound and novel risks. Currently, the exploration of agent governance questions and the development of associated interventions remain in their infancy. Only a few researchers, primarily in civil society organizations, public research institutes, and frontier AI companies, are actively working on these challenges.

Abstract: Publicly significant images from events hold valuable contextual information, crucial for journalism and education. However, existing methods often struggle to extract this relevance accurately. To address this, we introduce GETReason (Geospatial Event Temporal Reasoning), a framework that moves beyond surface-level image descriptions to infer deeper contextual meaning. We propose that extracting global event, temporal, and geospatial information enhances understanding of an image's significance. Additionally, we introduce GREAT (Geospatial Reasoning and Event Accuracy with Temporal Alignment), a new metric for evaluating reasoning-based image understanding. Our layered multi-agent approach, assessed using a reasoning-weighted metric, demonstrates that meaningful insights can be inferred, effectively linking images to their broader event context.

Abstract: This study presents an innovative approach to urban mobility simulation by integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) with Agent-Based Modeling (ABM). Unlike traditional rule-based ABM, the proposed framework leverages LLM to enhance agent diversity and realism by generating synthetic population profiles, allocating routine and occasional locations, and simulating personalized routes. Using real-world data, the simulation models individual behaviors and large-scale mobility patterns in Taipei City. Key insights, such as route heat maps and mode-specific indicators, provide urban planners with actionable information for policy-making. Future work focuses on establishing robust validation frameworks to ensure accuracy and reliability in urban planning applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains. However, standalone agents frequently encounter limitations when handling complex tasks that demand extensive interactions and substantial computational resources. Although Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) alleviate some of these limitations through collaborative mechanisms like task decomposition, iterative communication, and role specialization, they typically remain resource-unaware, incurring significant inefficiencies due to high token consumption and excessive execution time. To address these limitations, we propose a resource-aware multi-agent system -- Co-Saving (meaning that multiple agents collaboratively engage in resource-saving activities), which leverages experiential knowledge to enhance operational efficiency and solution quality. Our key innovation is the introduction of "shortcuts" -- instructional transitions learned from historically successful trajectories -- which allows to bypass redundant reasoning agents and expedite the collective problem-solving process. Experiments for software development tasks demonstrate significant advantages over existing methods. Specifically, compared to the state-of-the-art MAS ChatDev, our method achieves an average reduction of 50.85% in token usage, and improves the overall code quality by 10.06%.

Abstract: AI copilots, context-aware, AI-powered systems designed to assist users in tasks such as software development and content creation, are becoming integral to modern workflows. As these systems grow in capability and adoption, personalization has emerged as a cornerstone for ensuring usability, trust, and productivity. Central to this personalization is preference optimization: the ability of AI copilots to detect, interpret, and align with individual user preferences. While personalization techniques are well-established in domains like recommender systems and dialogue agents, their adaptation to interactive, real-time systems like AI copilots remains fragmented and underexplored. This survey addresses this gap by synthesizing research on how user preferences are captured, modeled, and refined within the design of AI copilots. We introduce a unified definition of AI copilots and propose a phase-based taxonomy of preference optimization strategies, structured around pre-interaction, mid-interaction, and post-interaction stages. We analyze techniques for acquiring preference signals, modeling user intent, and integrating feedback loops, highlighting both established approaches and recent innovations. By bridging insights from AI personalization, human-AI collaboration, and large language model adaptation, this survey provides a structured foundation for designing adaptive, preference-aware AI copilots. It offers a holistic view of the available preference resources, how they can be leveraged, and which technical approaches are most suited to each stage of system design.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows necessitates efficient Key-Value Cache (KVC) management to optimize inference performance. Inference workloads like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agents exhibit high cache reusability, making efficient caching critical to reducing redundancy and improving speed. We analyze real-world KVC access patterns using publicly available traces and evaluate commercial key-value stores like Redis and state-of-the-art RDMA-based systems (CHIME [1] and Sherman [2]) for KVC metadata management. Our work demonstrates the lack of tailored storage solution for KVC prefilling, underscores the need for an efficient distributed caching system with optimized metadata management for LLM workloads, and provides insights into designing improved KVC management systems for scalable, low-latency inference.

<title>RedTeamCUA: Realistic Adversarial Testing of Computer-Use Agents in Hybrid Web-OS Environments</title>

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) promise to automate complex tasks across operating systems (OS) and the web, but remain vulnerable to indirect prompt injection. Current evaluations of this threat either lack support realistic but controlled environments or ignore hybrid web-OS attack scenarios involving both interfaces. To address this, we propose RedTeamCUA, an adversarial testing framework featuring a novel hybrid sandbox that integrates a VM-based OS environment with Docker-based web platforms. Our sandbox supports key features tailored for red teaming, such as flexible adversarial scenario configuration, and a setting that decouples adversarial evaluation from navigational limitations of CUAs by initializing tests directly at the point of an adversarial injection. Using RedTeamCUA, we develop RTC-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with 864 examples that investigate realistic, hybrid web-OS attack scenarios and fundamental security vulnerabilities. Benchmarking current frontier CUAs identifies significant vulnerabilities: Claude 3.7 Sonnet | CUA demonstrates an ASR of 42.9%, while Operator, the most secure CUA evaluated, still exhibits an ASR of 7.6%. Notably, CUAs often attempt to execute adversarial tasks with an Attempt Rate as high as 92.5%, although failing to complete them due to capability limitations. Nevertheless, we observe concerning ASRs of up to 50% in realistic end-to-end settings, with the recently released frontier Claude 4 Opus | CUA showing an alarming ASR of 48%, demonstrating that indirect prompt injection presents tangible risks for even advanced CUAs despite their capabilities and safeguards. Overall, RedTeamCUA provides an essential framework for advancing realistic, controlled, and systematic analysis of CUA vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses to indirect prompt injection prior to real-world deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks. To further tailor LLMs to specific domains or applications, post-training techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Preference Learning, and model merging are commonly employed. While each of these methods has been extensively studied in isolation, the automated construction of complete post-training pipelines remains an underexplored area. Existing approaches typically rely on manual design or focus narrowly on optimizing individual components, such as data ordering or merging strategies. In this work, we introduce LaMDAgent (short for Language Model Developing Agent), a novel framework that autonomously constructs and optimizes full post-training pipelines through the use of LLM-based agents. LaMDAgent systematically explores diverse model generation techniques, datasets, and hyperparameter configurations, leveraging task-based feedback to discover high-performing pipelines with minimal human intervention. Our experiments show that LaMDAgent improves tool-use accuracy by 9.0 points while preserving instruction-following capabilities. Moreover, it uncovers effective post-training strategies that are often overlooked by conventional human-driven exploration. We further analyze the impact of data and model size scaling to reduce computational costs on the exploration, finding that model size scalings introduces new challenges, whereas scaling data size enables cost-effective pipeline discovery.

Abstract: External knowledge has played a crucial role in the recent development of computer use agents. We identify a critical knowledge-execution gap: retrieved knowledge often fails to translate into effective real-world task execution. Our analysis shows even 90\% correct knowledge yields only 41\% execution success rate. To bridge this gap, we propose UI-Evol, a plug-and-play module for autonomous GUI knowledge evolution. UI-Evol consists of two stages: a Retrace Stage that extracts faithful objective action sequences from actual agent-environment interactions, and a Critique Stage that refines existing knowledge by comparing these sequences against external references. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the OSWorld benchmark with the state-of-the-art Agent S2. Our results demonstrate that UI-Evol not only significantly boosts task performance but also addresses a previously overlooked issue of high behavioral standard deviation in computer use agents, leading to superior performance on computer use tasks and substantially improved agent reliability.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MapStory, an LLM-powered animation authoring tool that generates editable map animation sequences directly from natural language text. Given a user-written script, MapStory leverages an agentic architecture to automatically produce a scene breakdown, which decomposes the script into key animation building blocks such as camera movements, visual highlights, and animated elements. Our system includes a researcher component that accurately queries geospatial information by leveraging an LLM with web search, enabling the automatic extraction of relevant regions, paths, and coordinates while allowing users to edit and query for changes or additional information to refine the results. Additionally, users can fine-tune parameters of these blocks through an interactive timeline editor. We detail the system's design and architecture, informed by formative interviews with professional animators and an analysis of 200 existing map animation videos. Our evaluation, which includes expert interviews (N=5) and a usability study (N=12), demonstrates that MapStory enables users to create map animations with ease, facilitates faster iteration, encourages creative exploration, and lowers barriers to creating map-centric stories.

Abstract: Mainstream large vision-language models (LVLMs) inherently encode cultural biases, highlighting the need for diverse multimodal datasets. To address this gap, we introduce Pearl, a large-scale Arabic multimodal dataset and benchmark explicitly designed for cultural understanding. Constructed through advanced agentic workflows and extensive human-in-the-loop annotations by 45 annotators from across the Arab world, Pearl comprises over K multimodal examples spanning ten culturally significant domains covering all Arab countries. We further provide two robust evaluation benchmarks Pearl and Pearl-Lite along with a specialized subset Pearl-X explicitly developed to assess nuanced cultural variations. Comprehensive evaluations on state-of-the-art open and proprietary LVLMs demonstrate that reasoning-centric instruction alignment substantially improves models' cultural grounding compared to conventional scaling methods. Pearl establishes a foundational resource for advancing culturally-informed multimodal modeling research. All datasets and benchmarks are publicly available.

Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), effective communication improves agent performance, particularly under partial observability. We propose MARL-CPC, a framework that enables communication among fully decentralized, independent agents without parameter sharing. MARL-CPC incorporates a message learning model based on collective predictive coding (CPC) from emergent communication research. Unlike conventional methods that treat messages as part of the action space and assume cooperation, MARL-CPC links messages to state inference, supporting communication in non-cooperative, reward-independent settings. We introduce two algorithms -Bandit-CPC and IPPO-CPC- and evaluate them in non-cooperative MARL tasks. Benchmarks show that both outperform standard message-as-action approaches, establishing effective communication even when messages offer no direct benefit to the sender. These results highlight MARL-CPC's potential for enabling coordination in complex, decentralized environments.

Abstract: With large language models (LLMs) demonstrating remarkable capabilities, there has been a surge in research on leveraging LLMs to build general-purpose multi-modal agents. However, existing approaches either rely on computationally expensive end-to-end training using large-scale multi-modal data or adopt tool-use methods that lack the ability to continuously learn and adapt to new environments. In this paper, we introduce EHC, a general agent capable of learning without parameter updates. EHC consists of a Hierarchical Memory Retrieval (HMR) module and a Task-Category Oriented Experience Learning (TOEL) module. The HMR module facilitates rapid retrieval of relevant memories and continuously stores new information without being constrained by memory capacity. The TOEL module enhances the agent's comprehension of various task characteristics by classifying experiences and extracting patterns across different categories. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that EHC outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance and underscoring its effectiveness as a general agent for handling complex multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: Recognizing vulnerabilities in stripped binary files presents a significant challenge in software security. Although some progress has been made in generating human-readable information from decompiled binary files with Large Language Models (LLMs), effectively and scalably detecting vulnerabilities within these binary files is still an open problem. This paper explores the novel application of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities within these binary files. We demonstrate the feasibility of identifying vulnerable programs through a combined approach of decompilation optimization to make the vulnerabilities more prominent and long-term memory for a larger context window, achieving state-of-the-art performance in binary vulnerability analysis. Our findings highlight the potential for LLMs to overcome the limitations of traditional analysis methods and advance the field of binary vulnerability detection, paving the way for more secure software systems. In this paper, we present Vul-BinLLM , an LLM-based framework for binary vulnerability detection that mirrors traditional binary analysis workflows with fine-grained optimizations in decompilation and vulnerability reasoning with an extended context. In the decompilation phase, Vul-BinLLM adds vulnerability and weakness comments without altering the code structure or functionality, providing more contextual information for vulnerability reasoning later. Then for vulnerability reasoning, Vul-BinLLM combines in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting along with a memory management agent to enhance accuracy. Our evaluations encompass the commonly used synthetic dataset Juliet to evaluate the potential feasibility for analysis and vulnerability detection in C/C++ binaries. Our evaluations show that Vul-BinLLM is highly effective in detecting vulnerabilities on the compiled Juliet dataset.

Abstract: Embodied planning requires agents to make coherent multi-step decisions based on dynamic visual observations and natural language goals. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.

<title>AudioGenie: A Training-Free Multi-Agent Framework for Diverse Multimodality-to-Multiaudio Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodality-to-Multiaudio (MM2MA) generation faces significant challenges in synthesizing diverse and contextually aligned audio types (e.g., sound effects, speech, music, and songs) from multimodal inputs (e.g., video, text, images), owing to the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets and the lack of robust multi-task learning frameworks. Recently, multi-agent system shows great potential in tackling the above issues. However, directly applying it to MM2MA task presents three critical challenges: (1) inadequate fine-grained understanding of multimodal inputs (especially for video), (2) the inability of single models to handle diverse audio events, and (3) the absence of self-correction mechanisms for reliable outputs. To this end, we propose AudioGenie, a novel training-free multi-agent system featuring a dual-layer architecture with a generation team and a supervisor team. For the generation team, a fine-grained task decomposition and an adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) collaborative entity are designed for dynamic model selection, and a trial-and-error iterative refinement module is designed for self-correction. The supervisor team ensures temporal-spatial consistency and verifies outputs through feedback loops. Moreover, we build MA-Bench, the first benchmark for MM2MA tasks, comprising 198 annotated videos with multi-type audios. Experiments demonstrate that our AudioGenie outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across 9 metrics in 8 tasks. User study further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of quality, accuracy, alignment, and aesthetic.

Abstract: The alignment between humans and machines is a critical challenge in artificial intelligence today. Reinforcement learning, which aims to maximize a reward function, is particularly vulnerable to the risks associated with poorly designed reward functions. Recent advancements has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) for reward generation can outperform human performance in this context. We introduce VIRAL, a pipeline for generating and refining reward functions through the use of multi-modal LLMs. VIRAL autonomously creates and interactively improves reward functions based on a given environment and a goal prompt or annotated image. The refinement process can incorporate human feedback or be guided by a description generated by a video LLM, which explains the agent's policy in video form. We evaluated VIRAL in five Gymnasium environments, demonstrating that it accelerates the learning of new behaviors while ensuring improved alignment with user intent. The source-code and demo video are available at: https://github.com/VIRAL-UCBL1/VIRAL and https://youtu.be/t4_BXugBm9Q.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional sentiment analysis relies on surface-level linguistic patterns and retrospective data, limiting its ability to capture the psychological and contextual drivers of human sentiment. These limitations constrain its effectiveness in applications that require predictive insight, such as policy testing, narrative framing, and behavioral forecasting. We present a robust framework for sentiment simulation using generative AI agents embedded with psychologically rich profiles. Agents are instantiated from a nationally representative survey of 2,485 Filipino respondents, combining sociodemographic information with validated constructs of personality traits, values, beliefs, and socio-political attitudes. The framework includes three stages: (1) agent embodiment via categorical or contextualized encodings, (2) exposure to real-world political and economic scenarios, and (3) generation of sentiment ratings accompanied by explanatory rationales. Using Quadratic Weighted Accuracy (QWA), we evaluated alignment between agent-generated and human responses. Contextualized encoding achieved 92% alignment in replicating original survey responses. In sentiment simulation tasks, agents reached 81%--86% accuracy against ground truth sentiment, with contextualized profile encodings significantly outperforming categorical (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.70). Simulation results remained consistent across repeated trials (+/-0.2--0.5% SD) and resilient to variation in scenario framing (p = 0.9676, Cohen's d = 0.02). Our findings establish a scalable framework for sentiment modeling through psychographically grounded AI agents. This work signals a paradigm shift in sentiment analysis from retrospective classification to prospective and dynamic simulation grounded in psychology of sentiment formation.

<title>Lifted Forward Planning in Relational Factored Markov Decision Processes with Concurrent Actions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision making is a central problem in AI that can be formalized using a Markov Decision Process. A problem is that, with increasing numbers of (indistinguishable) objects, the state space grows exponentially. To compute policies, the state space has to be enumerated. Even more possibilities have to be enumerated if the size of the action space depends on the size of the state space, especially if we allow concurrent actions. To tackle the exponential blow-up in the action and state space, we present a first-order representation to store the spaces in polynomial instead of exponential size in the number of objects and introduce Foreplan, a relational forward planner, which uses this representation to efficiently compute policies for numerous indistinguishable objects and actions. Additionally, we introduce an even faster approximate version of Foreplan. Moreover, Foreplan identifies how many objects an agent should act on to achieve a certain task given restrictions. Further, we provide a theoretical analysis and an empirical evaluation of Foreplan, demonstrating a speedup of at least four orders of magnitude.

<title>Oryx: a Performant and Scalable Algorithm for Many-Agent Coordination in Offline MARL</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is achieving effective many-agent multi-step coordination in complex environments. In this work, we propose Oryx, a novel algorithm for offline cooperative MARL to directly address this challenge. Oryx adapts the recently proposed retention-based architecture Sable and combines it with a sequential form of implicit constraint Q-learning (ICQ), to develop a novel offline auto-regressive policy update scheme. This allows Oryx to solve complex coordination challenges while maintaining temporal coherence over lengthy trajectories. We evaluate Oryx across a diverse set of benchmarks from prior works (SMAC, RWARE, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo) covering tasks of both discrete and continuous control, varying in scale and difficulty. Oryx achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than 80% of the 65 tested datasets, outperforming prior offline MARL methods and demonstrating robust generalisation across domains with many agents and long horizons. Finally, we introduce new datasets to push the limits of many-agent coordination in offline MARL, and demonstrate Oryx's superior ability to scale effectively in such settings. We will make all of our datasets, experimental data, and code available upon publication.

<title>Online Fair Division for Personalized $2$-Value Instances</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22174</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an online fair division setting, where goods arrive one at a time and there is a fixed set of $n$ agents, each of whom has an additive valuation function over the goods. Once a good appears, the value each agent has for it is revealed and it must be allocated immediately and irrevocably to one of the agents. It is known that without any assumptions about the values being severely restricted or coming from a distribution, very strong impossibility results hold in this setting. To bypass the latter, we turn our attention to instances where the valuation functions are restricted. In particular, we study personalized $2$-value instances, where there are only two possible values each agent may have for each good, possibly different across agents, and we show how to obtain worst case guarantees with respect to well-known fairness notions, such as maximin share fairness and envy-freeness up to one (or two) good(s). We suggest a deterministic algorithm that maintains a $1/(2n-1)$-MMS allocation at every time step and show that this is the best possible any deterministic algorithm can achieve if one cares about every single time step; nevertheless, eventually the allocation constructed by our algorithm becomes a $1/4$-MMS allocation. To achieve this, the algorithm implicitly maintains a fragile system of priority levels for all agents. Further, we show that, by allowing some limited access to future information, it is possible to have stronger results with less involved approaches. By knowing the values of goods for $n-1$ time steps into the future, we design a matching-based algorithm that achieves an EF$1$ allocation every $n$ time steps, while always maintaining an EF$2$ allocation. Finally, we show that our results allow us to get the first nontrivial guarantees for additive instances in which the ratio of the maximum over the minimum value an agent has for a good is bounded.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) advance automatic task completion in various fields, where debate is a common cooperation form for agents to solve complicated problems with reasoning and cross-review to solidify answers. Assessing the individual contributions of agents within these debates is crucial for system refinement and outcome reliability. Traditional leave-one-out (LOO) method offers a clear framework for evaluating each agent's role but face challenges in LLM-based systems due to high computational costs and associated financial implications. This paper presents introspective-leave-one-out (IntrospecLOO), a simple yet effective prompting for approximation of LOO in LLM-powered multi-agent debates. IntrospecLOO introduces an additional querying round after standard debates, prompting agents to update their answers while ignoring responses from a designated agent. This strategy effectively isolates and gauges each participant's influence at a reduced query complexity compared to the original LOO approaches. Validation through experiments on three benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of IntrospecLOO.

Abstract: Coral reefs, crucial for sustaining marine biodiversity and ecological processes (e.g., nutrient cycling, habitat provision), face escalating threats, underscoring the need for efficient monitoring. Coral reef ecological monitoring faces dual challenges of low efficiency in manual analysis and insufficient segmentation accuracy in complex underwater scenarios. This study develops the YH-OSI system, establishing an intelligent framework centered on the Multimodal Large Model (MLLM) for "object detection-semantic segmentation-prior input". The system uses the object detection module (mAP@0.5=0.78) to generate spatial prior boxes for coral instances, driving the segment module to complete pixel-level segmentation in low-light and densely occluded scenarios. The segmentation masks and finetuned classification instructions are fed into the Qwen2-VL-based multimodal model as prior inputs, achieving a genus-level classification accuracy of 88% and simultaneously extracting core ecological metrics. Meanwhile, the system retains the scalability of the multimodal model through standardized interfaces, laying a foundation for future integration into multimodal agent-based underwater robots and supporting the full-process automation of "image acquisition-prior generation-real-time analysis."

Abstract: In this study, we propose a solution based on a multi-agent LLM architecture and a voice user interface (VUI) designed to update the knowledge base of a digital assistant. Its usability is evaluated in comparison to a more traditional graphical content management system (CMS), with a focus on understanding the relationship between user preferences and the complexity of the information being provided. The findings demonstrate that, while the overall usability of the VUI is rated lower than the graphical interface, it is already preferred by users for less complex tasks. Furthermore, the quality of content entered through the VUI is comparable to that achieved with the graphical interface, even for highly complex tasks. Obtained qualitative results suggest that a hybrid interface combining the strengths of both approaches could address the key challenges identified during the experiment, such as reducing cognitive load through graphical feedback while maintaining the intuitive nature of voice-based interactions. This work highlights the potential of conversational interfaces as a viable and effective method for knowledge management in specific business contexts.

Abstract: With the advent of 6G communications, intelligent communication systems face multiple challenges, including constrained perception and response capabilities, limited scalability, and low adaptability in dynamic environments. This tutorial provides a systematic introduction to the principles, design, and applications of Large Artificial Intelligence Models (LAMs) and Agentic AI technologies in intelligent communication systems, aiming to offer researchers a comprehensive overview of cutting-edge technologies and practical guidance. First, we outline the background of 6G communications, review the technological evolution from LAMs to Agentic AI, and clarify the tutorial's motivation and main contributions. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive review of the key components required for constructing LAMs. We further categorize LAMs and analyze their applicability, covering Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Vision Models (LVMs), Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), and lightweight LAMs. Next, we propose a LAM-centric design paradigm tailored for communications, encompassing dataset construction and both internal and external learning approaches. Building upon this, we develop an LAM-based Agentic AI system for intelligent communications, clarifying its core components such as planners, knowledge bases, tools, and memory modules, as well as its interaction mechanisms. We also introduce a multi-agent framework with data retrieval, collaborative planning, and reflective evaluation for 6G. Subsequently, we provide a detailed overview of the applications of LAMs and Agentic AI in communication scenarios. Finally, we summarize the research challenges and future directions in current studies, aiming to support the development of efficient, secure, and sustainable next-generation intelligent communication systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has highlighted critical challenges in cross-vendor service discovery, interoperability, and communication. Existing protocols like model context protocol and agent-to-agent protocol have made significant strides in standardizing interoperability between agents and tools, as well as communication among multi-agents. However, there remains a lack of standardized protocols and solutions for service discovery across different agent and tool vendors. In this paper, we propose AgentDNS, a root domain naming and service discovery system designed to enable LLM agents to autonomously discover, resolve, and securely invoke third-party agent and tool services across organizational and technological boundaries. Inspired by the principles of the traditional DNS, AgentDNS introduces a structured mechanism for service registration, semantic service discovery, secure invocation, and unified billing. We detail the architecture, core functionalities, and use cases of AgentDNS, demonstrating its potential to streamline multi-agent collaboration in real-world scenarios. The source code will be published on https://github.com/agentdns.

Abstract: Imagine we want to split a group of agents into teams in the most \emph{efficient} way, considering that each agent has their own preferences about their teammates. This scenario is modeled by the extensively studied \textsc{Coalition Formation} problem. Here, we study a version of this problem where each team must additionally be of bounded size.
  We conduct a systematic algorithmic study, providing several intractability results as well as multiple exact algorithms that scale well as the input grows (FPT), which could prove useful in practice.
  Our main contribution is an algorithm that deals efficiently with tree-like structures (bounded \emph{treewidth}) for ``small'' teams. We complement this result by proving that our algorithm is asymptotically optimal. Particularly, there can be no algorithm that vastly outperforms the one we present, under reasonable theoretical assumptions, even when considering star-like structures (bounded \emph{vertex cover number}).

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have made significant progress in mathematical capabilities in recent times. However, these successes have been primarily confined to competition-level problems. In this work, we propose AI Mathematician (AIM) framework, which harnesses the reasoning strength of LRMs to support frontier mathematical research. We have identified two critical challenges of mathematical research compared to competition, {\it the intrinsic complexity of research problems} and {\it the requirement of procedural rigor}. To address these challenges, AIM incorporates two core strategies: an exploration mechanism to foster longer solution paths, and the pessimistic reasonable verification method to ensure reliability.
  This early version of AIM already exhibits strong capability in tackling research-level tasks. We conducted extensive experiments across several real-world mathematical topics and obtained promising results. AIM is able to autonomously construct substantial portions of proofs and uncover non-trivial insights within each research area. These findings highlight the potential of LRMs in mathematical discovery and suggest that LRM-based agent systems could significantly accelerate mathematical research in the future.

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex tasks through collaborative intelligence. Nevertheless, the question of how agents should be structurally organized for optimal cooperation remains largely unexplored. In this position paper, we aim to gently redirect the focus of the MAS research community toward this critical dimension: develop topology-aware MASs for specific tasks. Specifically, the system consists of three core components - agents, communication links, and communication patterns - that collectively shape its coordination performance and efficiency. To this end, we introduce a systematic, three-stage framework: agent selection, structure profiling, and topology synthesis. Each stage would trigger new research opportunities in areas such as language models, reinforcement learning, graph learning, and generative modeling; together, they could unleash the full potential of MASs in complicated real-world applications. Then, we discuss the potential challenges and opportunities in the evaluation of multiple systems. We hope our perspective and framework can offer critical new insights in the era of agentic AI.

Abstract: In the intelligent era, the interaction between humans and intelligent systems fundamentally involves collaboration with autonomous intelligent agents. Human-AI Collaboration (HAC) represents a novel type of human-machine relationship facilitated by autonomous intelligent machines equipped with AI technologies. In this paradigm, AI agents serve not only as auxiliary tools but also as active teammates, partnering with humans to accomplish tasks collaboratively. Human-centered AI (HCAI) emphasizes that humans play critical leadership roles in the collaboration. This human-led collaboration imparts new dimensions to the human-machine relationship, necessitating innovative research perspectives, paradigms, and agenda to address the unique challenges posed by HAC. This chapter delves into the essence of HAC from the human-centered perspective, outlining its core concepts and distinguishing features. It reviews the current research methodologies and research agenda within the HAC field from the HCAI perspective, highlighting advancements and ongoing studies. Furthermore, a framework for human-centered HAC (HCHAC) is proposed by integrating these reviews and analyses. A case study of HAC in the context of autonomous vehicles is provided, illustrating practical applications and the synergistic interactions between humans and AI agents. Finally, it identifies potential future research directions aimed at enhancing the effectiveness, reliability, and ethical integration of human-centered HAC systems in diverse domains.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of agentic information seeking capabilities through the integration of tools such as search engines and web browsers. However, current mainstream approaches for enabling LLM web search proficiency face significant challenges: supervised fine-tuning struggles with data production in open-search domains, while RL converges quickly, limiting their data utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose EvolveSearch, a novel iterative self-evolution framework that combines SFT and RL to enhance agentic web search capabilities without any external human-annotated reasoning data. Extensive experiments on seven multi-hop question-answering (MHQA) benchmarks demonstrate that EvolveSearch consistently improves performance across iterations, ultimately achieving an average improvement of 4.7\% over the current state-of-the-art across seven benchmarks, opening the door to self-evolution agentic capabilities in open web search domains.

<title>From Strangers to Assistants: Fast Desire Alignment for Embodied Agent-User Adaptation</title>

Abstract: While embodied agents have made significant progress in performing complex physical tasks, real-world applications demand more than pure task execution. The agents must collaborate with unfamiliar agents and human users, whose goals are often vague and implicit. In such settings, interpreting ambiguous instructions and uncovering underlying desires is essential for effective assistance. Therefore, fast and accurate desire alignment becomes a critical capability for embodied agents. In this work, we first develop a home assistance simulation environment HA-Desire that integrates an LLM-driven human user agent exhibiting realistic value-driven goal selection and communication. The ego agent must interact with this proxy user to infer and adapt to the user's latent desires. To achieve this, we present a novel framework FAMER for fast desire alignment, which introduces a desire-based mental reasoning mechanism to identify user intent and filter desire-irrelevant actions. We further design a reflection-based communication module that reduces redundant inquiries, and incorporate goal-relevant information extraction with memory persistence to improve information reuse and reduce unnecessary exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances both task execution and communication efficiency, enabling embodied agents to quickly adapt to user-specific desires in complex embodied environments.

Abstract: This study examines the impact of an AI instructional agent on students' perceived learner control and academic performance in a medium demanding course with lecturing as the main teaching strategy. Based on a randomized controlled trial, three instructional conditions were compared: a traditional human teacher, a self-paced MOOC with chatbot support, and an AI instructional agent capable of delivering lectures and responding to questions in real time. Students in the AI instructional agent group reported significantly higher levels of perceived learner control compared to the other groups. They also completed the learning task more efficiently and engaged in more frequent interactions with the instructional system. Regression analyzes showed that perceived learner control positively predicted post-test performance, with behavioral indicators such as reduced learning time and higher interaction frequency supporting this relationship. These findings suggest that AI instructional agents, when designed to support personalized pace and responsive interaction, can enhance both students' learning experience and learning outcomes.

Abstract: Open-ended learning (OEL) -- which emphasizes training agents that achieve broad capability over narrow competency -- is emerging as a paradigm to develop artificial intelligence (AI) agents to achieve robustness and generalization. However, despite promising results that demonstrate the benefits of OEL, applying OEL to develop autonomous agents for real-world cybersecurity applications remains a challenge.
  We propose a training approach, inspired by OEL, to develop autonomous network defenders. Our results demonstrate that like in other domains, OEL principles can translate into more robust and generalizable agents for cyber defense. To apply OEL to network defense, it is necessary to address several technical challenges. Most importantly, it is critical to provide a task representation approach over a broad universe of tasks that maintains a consistent interface over goals, rewards and action spaces. This way, the learning agent can train with varying network conditions, attacker behaviors, and defender goals while being able to build on previously gained knowledge.
  With our tools and results, we aim to fundamentally impact research that applies AI to solve cybersecurity problems. Specifically, as researchers develop gyms and benchmarks for cyber defense, it is paramount that they consider diverse tasks with consistent representations, such as those we propose in our work.

Abstract: Tactile perception is essential for embodied agents to understand physical attributes of objects that cannot be determined through visual inspection alone. While existing approaches have made progress in visual and language modalities for physical understanding, they fail to effectively incorporate tactile information that provides crucial haptic feedback for real-world interaction. In this paper, we present VTV-LLM, the first multi-modal large language model for universal Visuo-Tactile Video (VTV) understanding that bridges the gap between tactile perception and natural language. To address the challenges of cross-sensor and cross-modal integration, we contribute VTV150K, a comprehensive dataset comprising 150,000 video frames from 100 diverse objects captured across three different tactile sensors (GelSight Mini, DIGIT, and Tac3D), annotated with four fundamental tactile attributes (hardness, protrusion, elasticity, and friction). We develop a novel three-stage training paradigm that includes VTV enhancement for robust visuo-tactile representation, VTV-text alignment for cross-modal correspondence, and text prompt finetuning for natural language generation. Our framework enables sophisticated tactile reasoning capabilities including feature assessment, comparative analysis, scenario-based decision making and so on. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that VTV-LLM achieves superior performance in tactile video understanding tasks, establishing a foundation for more intuitive human-machine interaction in tactile domains.

<title>Agent-UniRAG: A Trainable Open-Source LLM Agent Framework for Unified Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems</title>

arXiv:2505.22571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for unified retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using the recent emerging large language model (LLM) agent concept. Specifically, Agent LLM, which utilizes LLM as fundamental controllers, has become a promising approach to enable the interpretability of RAG tasks, especially for complex reasoning question-answering systems (e.g., multi-hop queries). Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits the application of those approaches to real-world applications. In this study, we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of RAG systems. The main idea is to design an LLM agent framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-3-8B). The results show comparable performances with closed-source and larger open-source LLMs across various RAG benchmarks. Our source code and dataset are publicly available for further exploitation.

Abstract: Benchmarks for Software Engineering (SE) AI agents, most notably SWE-bench, have catalyzed progress in programming capabilities of AI agents. However, they overlook critical developer workflows such as Version Control System (VCS) operations. To address this issue, we present GitGoodBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agent performance on VCS tasks. GitGoodBench covers three core Git scenarios extracted from permissive open-source Python, Java, and Kotlin repositories. Our benchmark provides three datasets: a comprehensive evaluation suite (900 samples), a rapid prototyping version (120 samples), and a training corpus (17,469 samples). We establish baseline performance on the prototyping version of our benchmark using GPT-4o equipped with custom tools, achieving a 21.11% solve rate overall. We expect GitGoodBench to serve as a crucial stepping stone toward truly comprehensive SE agents that go beyond mere programming.

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been widely tested using tools like OpenAI Gym, though many tasks in these environments could also benefit from hierarchical planning. However, there is a lack of a tool that enables seamless integration of hierarchical planning with RL. Hierarchical Domain Definition Language (HDDL), used in classical planning, introduces a structured approach well-suited for model-based RL to address this gap. To bridge this integration, we introduce HDDLGym, a Python-based tool that automatically generates OpenAI Gym environments from HDDL domains and problems. HDDLGym serves as a link between RL and hierarchical planning, supporting multi-agent scenarios and enabling collaborative planning among agents. This paper provides an overview of HDDLGym's design and implementation, highlighting the challenges and design choices involved in integrating HDDL with the Gym interface, and applying RL policies to support hierarchical planning. We also provide detailed instructions and demonstrations for using the HDDLGym framework, including how to work with existing HDDL domains and problems from International Planning Competitions, exemplified by the Transport domain. Additionally, we offer guidance on creating new HDDL domains for multi-agent scenarios and demonstrate the practical use of HDDLGym in the Overcooked domain. By leveraging the advantages of HDDL and Gym, HDDLGym aims to be a valuable tool for studying RL in hierarchical planning, particularly in multi-agent contexts.

Abstract: Scientific embodied agents play a crucial role in modern laboratories by automating complex experimental workflows. Compared to typical household environments, laboratory settings impose significantly higher demands on perception of physical-chemical transformations and long-horizon planning, making them an ideal testbed for advancing embodied intelligence. However, its development has been long hampered by the lack of suitable simulator and benchmarks. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing LabUtopia, a comprehensive simulation and benchmarking suite designed to facilitate the development of generalizable, reasoning-capable embodied agents in laboratory settings. Specifically, it integrates i) LabSim, a high-fidelity simulator supporting multi-physics and chemically meaningful interactions; ii) LabScene, a scalable procedural generator for diverse scientific scenes; and iii) LabBench, a hierarchical benchmark spanning five levels of complexity from atomic actions to long-horizon mobile manipulation. LabUtopia supports 30 distinct tasks and includes more than 200 scene and instrument assets, enabling large-scale training and principled evaluation in high-complexity environments. We demonstrate that LabUtopia offers a powerful platform for advancing the integration of perception, planning, and control in scientific-purpose agents and provides a rigorous testbed for exploring the practical capabilities and generalization limits of embodied intelligence in future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven significant progress in robotics, but its complexity and long training times remain major bottlenecks. In this report, we introduce FastTD3, a simple, fast, and capable RL algorithm that significantly speeds up training for humanoid robots in popular suites such as HumanoidBench, IsaacLab, and MuJoCo Playground. Our recipe is remarkably simple: we train an off-policy TD3 agent with several modifications -- parallel simulation, large-batch updates, a distributional critic, and carefully tuned hyperparameters. FastTD3 solves a range of HumanoidBench tasks in under 3 hours on a single A100 GPU, while remaining stable during training. We also provide a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of FastTD3 to accelerate RL research in robotics.

Abstract: Addressing intricate real-world problems necessitates in-depth information seeking and multi-step reasoning. Recent progress in agentic systems, exemplified by Deep Research, underscores the potential for autonomous multi-step research. In this work, we present a cohesive paradigm for building end-to-end agentic information seeking agents from a data-centric and training-stage perspective. Our approach consists of four key stages: (1) browsing data construction, (2) trajectories sampling, (3) supervised fine-tuning for effective cold start, and (4) reinforcement learning for enhanced generalisation. We instantiate this framework in a web agent based on the ReAct, WebDancer. Empirical evaluations on the challenging information seeking benchmarks, GAIA and WebWalkerQA, demonstrate the strong performance of WebDancer, achieving considerable results and highlighting the efficacy of our training paradigm. Further analysis of agent training provides valuable insights and actionable, systematic pathways for developing more capable agentic models. The codes and demo will be released in https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/WebAgent.

<title>Position: Uncertainty Quantification Needs Reassessment for Large-language Model Agents</title>

arXiv:2505.22655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and chatbot agents are known to provide wrong outputs at times, and it was recently found that this can never be fully prevented. Hence, uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role, aiming to quantify the level of ambiguity in either one overall number or two numbers for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This position paper argues that this traditional dichotomy of uncertainties is too limited for the open and interactive setup that LLM agents operate in when communicating with a user, and that we need to research avenues that enrich uncertainties in this novel scenario. We review the literature and find that popular definitions of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties directly contradict each other and lose their meaning in interactive LLM agent settings. Hence, we propose three novel research directions that focus on uncertainties in such human-computer interactions: Underspecification uncertainties, for when users do not provide all information or define the exact task at the first go, interactive learning, to ask follow-up questions and reduce the uncertainty about the current context, and output uncertainties, to utilize the rich language and speech space to express uncertainties as more than mere numbers. We expect that these new ways of dealing with and communicating uncertainties will lead to LLM agent interactions that are more transparent, trustworthy, and intuitive.

arXiv:2505.22657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans excel at performing complex tasks by leveraging long-term memory across temporal and spatial experiences. In contrast, current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively plan and act in dynamic, multi-room 3D environments. We posit that part of this limitation is due to the lack of proper 3D spatial-temporal memory modeling in LLMs. To address this, we first introduce 3DMem-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 26,000 trajectories and 2,892 embodied tasks, question-answering and captioning, designed to evaluate an agent's ability to reason over long-term memory in 3D environments. Second, we propose 3DLLM-Mem, a novel dynamic memory management and fusion model for embodied spatial-temporal reasoning and actions in LLMs. Our model uses working memory tokens, which represents current observations, as queries to selectively attend to and fuse the most useful spatial and temporal features from episodic memory, which stores past observations and interactions. Our approach allows the agent to focus on task-relevant information while maintaining memory efficiency in complex, long-horizon environments. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DLLM-Mem achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, outperforming the strongest baselines by 16.5% in success rate on 3DMem-Bench's most challenging in-the-wild embodied tasks.

Abstract: Controlling payoffs in repeated games is one of the important topics in control theory of multi-agent systems. Recently proposed zero-determinant strategies enable players to unilaterally enforce linear relations between payoffs. Furthermore, based on the mathematics of zero-determinant strategies, regional payoff control, in which payoffs are enforced into some feasible regions, has been discovered in social dilemma situations. More recently, theory of payoff control was extended to multichannel games, where players parallelly interact with each other in multiple channels. However, properties of zero-determinant strategies specific to multichannel games are still not clear. In this paper, we elucidate properties of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games. First, we relate the existence condition of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games to that of zero-determinant strategies in each channel. We then show that the existence of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games requires the existence of zero-determinant strategies in some channels. This result implies that the existence of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games is tightly restricted by structure of games played in each channel.

Abstract: The development of robust odor navigation strategies for automated environmental monitoring applications requires realistic simulations of odor time series for agents moving across large spatial scales. Traditional approaches that rely on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods can capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of odor plumes, but are impractical for large-scale simulations due to their computational expense. On the other hand, puff-based simulations, although computationally tractable for large scales and capable of capturing the stochastic nature of plumes, fail to reproduce naturalistic odor statistics. Here, we present COSMOS (Configurable Odor Simulation Model over Scalable Spaces), a data-driven probabilistic framework that synthesizes realistic odor time series from spatial and temporal features of real datasets. COSMOS generates similar distributions of key statistical features such as whiff frequency, duration, and concentration as observed in real data, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. By reproducing critical statistical properties across a variety of flow regimes and scales, COSMOS enables the development and evaluation of agent-based navigation strategies with naturalistic odor experiences. To demonstrate its utility, we compare odor-tracking agents exposed to CFD-generated plumes versus COSMOS simulations, showing that both their odor experiences and resulting behaviors are quite similar.

Abstract: We study Stackelberg games where a principal repeatedly interacts with a non-myopic long-lived agent, without knowing the agent's payoff function. Although learning in Stackelberg games is well-understood when the agent is myopic, dealing with non-myopic agents poses additional complications. In particular, non-myopic agents may strategize and select actions that are inferior in the present in order to mislead the principal's learning algorithm and obtain better outcomes in the future.
  We provide a general framework that reduces learning in presence of non-myopic agents to robust bandit optimization in the presence of myopic agents. Through the design and analysis of minimally reactive bandit algorithms, our reduction trades off the statistical efficiency of the principal's learning algorithm against its effectiveness in inducing near-best-responses. We apply this framework to Stackelberg security games (SSGs), pricing with unknown demand curve, general finite Stackelberg games, and strategic classification. In each setting, we characterize the type and impact of misspecifications present in near-best responses and develop a learning algorithm robust to such misspecifications.
  On the way, we improve the state-of-the-art query complexity of learning in SSGs with $n$ targets from $O(n^3)$ to a near-optimal $\widetilde{O}(n)$ by uncovering a fundamental structural property of these games. The latter result is of independent interest beyond learning with non-myopic agents.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using world models has found significant recent successes. However, when a sudden change to world mechanics or properties occurs then agent performance and reliability can dramatically decline. We refer to the sudden change in visual properties or state transitions as novelties. Implementing novelty detection within generated world model frameworks is a crucial task for protecting the agent when deployed. In this paper, we propose straightforward bounding approaches to incorporate novelty detection into world model RL agents, by utilizing the misalignment of the world model's hallucinated states and the true observed states as an anomaly score. We provide effective approaches to detecting novelties in a distribution of transitions learned by an agent in a world model. Finally, we show the advantage of our work in a novel environment compared to traditional machine learning novelty detection methods as well as currently accepted RL focused novelty detection algorithms.

Abstract: We introduce LArge Model Based Data Agent (LAMBDA), a novel open-source, code-free multi-agent data analysis system that leverages the power of large language models. LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in data-driven applications through innovatively designed data agents using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user's instructions and domain-specific knowledge, while the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention. Moreover, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various data analysis tasks. It has the potential to enhance data analysis paradigms by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making it more accessible, effective, and efficient for users from diverse backgrounds. The strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data analysis problems is demonstrated using real-world data examples. The code for LAMBDA is available at https://github.com/AMA-CMFAI/LAMBDA and videos of three case studies can be viewed at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.

Abstract: State of the art reinforcement learning methods sometimes encounter unsafe situations. Identifying when these situations occur is of interest both for post-hoc analysis and during deployment, where it might be advantageous to call out to a human overseer for help. Efforts to gauge the criticality of different points in time have been developed, but their accuracy is not well established due to a lack of ground truth, and they are not designed to be easily interpretable by end users. Therefore, we seek to define a criticality framework with both a quantifiable ground truth and a clear significance to users. We introduce true criticality as the expected drop in reward when an agent deviates from its policy for n consecutive random actions. We also introduce the concept of proxy criticality, a low-overhead metric that has a statistically monotonic relationship to true criticality. Safety margins make these interpretable, when defined as the number of random actions for which performance loss will not exceed some tolerance with high confidence. We demonstrate this approach in several environment-agent combinations; for an A3C agent in an Atari Beamrider environment, the lowest 5% of safety margins contain 47% of agent losses; i.e., supervising only 5% of decisions could potentially prevent roughly half of an agent's errors. This criticality framework measures the potential impacts of bad decisions, even before those decisions are made, allowing for more effective debugging and oversight of autonomous agents.

Abstract: Despite rapid technological progress, effective human-machine cooperation remains a significant challenge. Humans tend to cooperate less with machines than with fellow humans, a phenomenon known as the machine penalty. Here, we show that artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models can overcome this penalty in social dilemma games with communication. In a pre-registered experiment with 1,152 participants, we deploy AI agents exhibiting three distinct personas: selfish, cooperative, and fair. However, only fair agents elicit human cooperation at rates comparable to human-human interactions. Analysis reveals that fair agents, similar to human participants, occasionally break pre-game cooperation promises, but nonetheless effectively establish cooperation as a social norm. These results challenge the conventional wisdom of machines as altruistic assistants or rational actors. Instead, our study highlights the importance of AI agents reflecting the nuanced complexity of human social behaviors -- imperfect yet driven by deeper social cognitive processes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities, but they still struggle with faithful reasoning due to knowledge gaps and hallucinations. To address these issues, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been utilized to enhance LLM reasoning through their structured knowledge. However, existing KG-enhanced methods, either retrieval-based or agent-based, encounter difficulties in accurately retrieving knowledge and efficiently traversing KGs at scale. In this work, we introduce graph-constrained reasoning (GCR), a novel framework that bridges structured knowledge in KGs with unstructured reasoning in LLMs. To eliminate hallucinations, GCR ensures faithful KG-grounded reasoning by integrating KG structure into the LLM decoding process through KG-Trie, a trie-based index that encodes KG reasoning paths. KG-Trie constrains the decoding process, allowing LLMs to directly reason on graphs and generate faithful reasoning paths grounded in KGs. Additionally, GCR leverages a lightweight KG-specialized LLM for graph-constrained reasoning alongside a powerful general LLM for inductive reasoning over multiple reasoning paths, resulting in accurate reasoning with zero reasoning hallucination. Extensive experiments on several KGQA benchmarks demonstrate that GCR achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong zero-shot generalizability to unseen KGs without additional training.

Abstract: Foundation model-based agents are increasingly used to automate complex tasks, enhancing efficiency and productivity. However, their access to sensitive resources and autonomous decision-making also introduce significant security risks, where successful attacks could lead to severe consequences. To systematically uncover these vulnerabilities, we propose AdvAgent, a black-box red-teaming framework for attacking web agents. Unlike existing approaches, AdvAgent employs a reinforcement learning-based pipeline to train an adversarial prompter model that optimizes adversarial prompts using feedback from the black-box agent. With careful attack design, these prompts effectively exploit agent weaknesses while maintaining stealthiness and controllability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AdvAgent achieves high success rates against state-of-the-art GPT-4-based web agents across diverse web tasks. Furthermore, we find that existing prompt-based defenses provide only limited protection, leaving agents vulnerable to our framework. These findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in current web agents and emphasize the urgent need for stronger defense mechanisms. We release code at https://ai-secure.github.io/AdvAgent/.

<title>The Stepwise Deception: Simulating the Evolution from True News to Fake News with LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: With the growing spread of misinformation online, understanding how true news evolves into fake news has become crucial for early detection and prevention. However, previous research has often assumed fake news inherently exists rather than exploring its gradual formation. To address this gap, we propose FUSE (Fake news evolUtion Simulation framEwork), a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based simulation approach explicitly focusing on fake news evolution from real news. Our framework model a social network with four distinct types of LLM agents commonly observed in daily interactions: spreaders who propagate information, commentators who provide interpretations, verifiers who fact-check, and bystanders who observe passively to simulate realistic daily interactions that progressively distort true news. To quantify these gradual distortions, we develop FUSE-EVAL, a comprehensive evaluation framework measuring truth deviation along multiple linguistic and semantic dimensions. Results show that FUSE effectively captures fake news evolution patterns and accurately reproduces known fake news, aligning closely with human evaluations. Experiments demonstrate that FUSE accurately reproduces known fake news evolution scenarios, aligns closely with human judgment, and highlights the importance of timely intervention at early stages. Our framework is extensible, enabling future research on broader scenarios of fake news.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can solve diverse tasks but often exhibit unsafe behavior. Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) address this by enforcing safety constraints, yet existing methods either sacrifice reward maximization or allow unsafe training. We introduce Constrained Trust Region Policy Optimization (C-TRPO), which reshapes the policy space geometry to ensure trust regions contain only safe policies, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction throughout training. We analyze its theoretical properties and connections to TRPO, Natural Policy Gradient (NPG), and Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO). Experiments show that C-TRPO reduces constraint violations while maintaining competitive returns.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence progresses towards the "Era of Experience," where agents are expected to learn from continuous, grounded interaction. We argue that traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL), which typically represents value as a scalar, can restrict agent's deep understanding of environments and hinders the active, deliberative learning crucial for navigating this new paradigm. To address the issue, we introduce Natural Language Reinforcement Learning (NLRL), a framework that extends RL principles into natural language counterparts. Central to NLRL is the Language Value Function (LVF), which redefines value as an interpretable linguistic narrative articulating the rationale behind an evaluation. NLRL further extends this concept to core RL components, including policy, the Bellman equation, and policy iteration. Leveraging recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), NLRL can be practically implemented to achieve RL-like policy and value training through unsupervised environment interactions. Experiments over 4 multi-step agentic tasks demonstrate NLRL's effectiveness, efficiency, and its potential to foster deeper understanding and more active learning strategies.

Abstract: Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches. Project page: https://tev-fbk.github.io/fun3du/

Abstract: In self-supervised robotic learning, agents acquire data through active interaction with their environment, incurring costs such as energy use, human oversight, and experimental time. To mitigate these, sample-efficient exploration is essential. While intrinsic motivation (IM) methods like learning progress (LP) are widely used in robotics, and active learning (AL) is well established for classification in machine learning, few frameworks address continuous, high-dimensional regression tasks typical of world model learning. We propose MUSEL (Model Uncertainty for Sample-Efficient Learning), a novel AL framework tailored for regression tasks in robotics, such as action-effect prediction. MUSEL introduces a model uncertainty metric that combines total predictive uncertainty, learning progress, and input diversity to guide data acquisition. We validate our approach using a Stochastic Variational Deep Kernel Learning (SVDKL) model in two robotic tabletop tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MUSEL improves both learning accuracy and sample efficiency, validating its effectiveness in learning action effects and selecting informative samples.

Abstract: We address the problem of interactive text-to-image (T2I) generation, designing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent which iteratively improves a set of generated images for a user through a sequence of prompt expansions. Using human raters, we create a novel dataset of sequential preferences, which we leverage, together with large-scale open-source (non-sequential) datasets. We construct user-preference and user-choice models using an EM strategy and identify varying user preference types. We then leverage a large multimodal language model (LMM) and a value-based RL approach to suggest an adaptive and diverse slate of prompt expansions to the user. Our Preference Adaptive and Sequential Text-to-image Agent (PASTA) extends T2I models with adaptive multi-turn capabilities, fostering collaborative co-creation and addressing uncertainty or underspecification in a user's intent. We evaluate PASTA using human raters, showing significant improvement compared to baseline methods. We also open-source our sequential rater dataset and simulated user-rater interactions to support future research in user-centric multi-turn T2I systems.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities as zero-shot planners for embodied agents, their inability to learn from experience and build persistent mental models limits their robustness in complex open-world environments like Minecraft. We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.

Abstract: As the general capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) agents continue to evolve, their ability to learn to master multiple complex tasks through experience remains a key challenge. Current LLM agents, particularly those based on proprietary language models, typically rely on prompts to incorporate knowledge about the target tasks. This approach does not allow the agent to internalize this information and instead relies on ever-expanding prompts to sustain its functionality in diverse scenarios. This resembles a system of notes used by a person affected by anterograde amnesia, the inability to form new memories. In this paper, we propose a novel method to train AI agents to incorporate knowledge and skills for multiple tasks without the need for either cumbersome note systems or prior high-quality demonstration data. Our approach employs an iterative process where the agent collects new experiences, receives corrective feedback from humans in the form of hints, and integrates this feedback into its weights via a context distillation training procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by implementing it in a Llama-3-based agent that, after only a few rounds of feedback, outperforms advanced models GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 in tasksets requiring correct sequencing of information retrieval, tool use, and question answering.

Abstract: Reward design in reinforcement learning and optimal control is challenging. Preference-based alignment addresses this by enabling agents to learn rewards from ranked trajectory pairs provided by humans. However, existing methods often struggle from poor robustness to unknown false human preferences. In this work, we propose a robust and efficient reward alignment method based on a novel and geometrically interpretable perspective: hypothesis space batched cutting. Our method iteratively refines the reward hypothesis space through "cuts" based on batches of human preferences. Within each batch, human preferences, queried based on disagreement, are grouped using a voting function to determine the appropriate cut, ensuring a bounded human query complexity. To handle unknown erroneous preferences, we introduce a conservative cutting method within each batch, preventing erroneous human preferences from making overly aggressive cuts to the hypothesis space. This guarantees provable robustness against false preferences, while eliminating the need to explicitly identify them. We evaluate our method in a model predictive control setting across diverse tasks. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods in error-free settings while significantly outperforming existing methods when handling a high percentage of erroneous human preferences.

Abstract: We study explanation design in algorithmic decision making with strategic agents, individuals who may modify their inputs in response to explanations of a decision maker's (DM's) predictive model. As the demand for transparent algorithmic systems continues to grow, most prior work assumes full model disclosure as the default solution. In practice, however, DMs such as financial institutions typically disclose only partial model information via explanations. Such partial disclosure can lead agents to misinterpret the model and take actions that unknowingly harm their utility. A key open question is how DMs can communicate explanations in a way that avoids harming strategic agents, while still supporting their own decision-making goals, e.g., minimising predictive error. In this work, we analyse well-known explanation methods, and establish a necessary condition to prevent explanations from misleading agents into self-harming actions. Moreover, with a conditional homogeneity assumption, we prove that action recommendation-based explanations (ARexes) are sufficient for non-harmful responses, mirroring the revelation principle in information design. To demonstrate how ARexes can be operationalised in practice, we propose a simple learning procedure that jointly optimises the predictive model and explanation policy. Experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks show that ARexes allow the DM to optimise their model's predictive performance while preserving agents' utility, offering a more refined strategy for safe and effective partial model disclosure.

Abstract: Role-playing language agents (RPLAs) have emerged as promising applications of large language models (LLMs). However, simulating established characters presents a challenging task for RPLAs, due to the lack of authentic character datasets and nuanced evaluation methods using such data. In this paper, we present CoSER, a collection of a high-quality dataset, open models, and an evaluation protocol towards effective RPLAs of established characters. The CoSER dataset covers 17,966 characters from 771 renowned books. It provides authentic dialogues with real-world intricacies, as well as diverse data types such as conversation setups, character experiences and internal thoughts. Drawing from acting methodology, we introduce given-circumstance acting for training and evaluating role-playing LLMs, where LLMs sequentially portray multiple characters in book scenes. Using our dataset, we develop CoSER 8B and CoSER 70B, i.e., advanced open role-playing LLMs built on LLaMA-3.1 models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the value of the CoSER dataset for RPLA training, evaluation and retrieval. Moreover, CoSER 70B exhibits state-of-the-art performance surpassing or matching GPT-4o on our evaluation and three existing benchmarks, i.e., achieving 75.80% and 93.47% accuracy on the InCharacter and LifeChoice benchmarks respectively.

Abstract: Recent success in large multimodal models (LMMs) has sparked promising applications of agents capable of autonomously completing complex web tasks. While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities. We hope this study makes state-of-the-art LMM-based agent research at a larger scale more accessible.

Abstract: Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. DPT-Agent can effectively help LLMs convert correct slow thinking and reasoning into executable actions, thereby improving performance. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously. Code of DPT-Agent can be found in https://github.com/sjtu-marl/DPT-Agent.

Abstract: Answering complex, long-context questions remains a major challenge for large language models (LLMs) as it requires effective question clarifications and context retrieval. We propose Agentic Long-Context Understanding (AgenticLU), a framework designed to enhance an LLM's understanding of such queries by integrating targeted self-clarification with contextual grounding within an agentic workflow. At the core of AgenticLU is Chain-of-Clarifications (CoC), where models refine their understanding through self-generated clarification questions and corresponding contextual groundings. By scaling inference as a tree search where each node represents a CoC step, we achieve 97.8% answer recall on NarrativeQA with a search depth of up to three and a branching factor of eight. To amortize the high cost of this search process to training, we leverage the preference pairs for each step obtained by the CoC workflow and perform two-stage model finetuning: (1) supervised finetuning to learn effective decomposition strategies, and (2) direct preference optimization to enhance reasoning quality. This enables AgenticLU models to generate clarifications and retrieve relevant context effectively and efficiently in a single inference pass. Extensive experiments across seven long-context tasks demonstrate that AgenticLU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompting methods and specialized long-context LLMs, achieving robust multi-hop reasoning while sustaining consistent performance as context length grows.

Abstract: Translating state-of-the-art NLP into practice often stalls at the "last mile" owing to insufficient contextualization of the target domain's knowledge, processes, and evaluation. Psychiatric differential diagnosis exemplifies this challenge: accurate assessments depend on nuanced clinical knowledge, a delicate cognitive-affective interview process, and downstream outcomes that extend far beyond benchmark accuracy. We present WiseMind, a systematic interdisciplinary contextualization framework that delivers both instrumental (diagnostic precision) and humanistic (empathy) gains. WiseMind comprises three components:(i) structured knowledge-guided proactive reasoning, which embeds DSM-5 criteria in a knowledge graph to steer questioning; (ii) a theory-informed dual-agent architecture that coordinates a "reasonable-mind" reasoning agent and an "emotional-mind" empathy agent, inspired by Dialectical Behavior Therapy; and (iii) a multi-faceted evaluation strategy covering simulated patients, user studies, clinician review, and ethical assessment. Tested on depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, WiseMind attains up to 84.2% diagnostic accuracy, which is comparable to human experts, while outperforming single-agent baselines in perceived empathy and trustworthiness. These results show that deep contextualization-across knowledge, process, and evaluation layers-can transform benchmark-driven NLP into clinically meaningful impact.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively leverage common-sense knowledge for general reasoning, yet they struggle with personalized reasoning when tasked with interpreting multifactor personal data. This limitation restricts their applicability in domains that require context-aware decision-making tailored to individuals. This paper introduces Personalized Causal Graph Reasoning as an agentic framework that enhances LLM reasoning by incorporating personal causal graphs derived from data of individuals. These graphs provide a foundation that guides the LLM's reasoning process. We evaluate it on a case study on nutrient-oriented dietary recommendations, which requires personal reasoning due to the implicit unique dietary effects. We propose a counterfactual evaluation to estimate the efficiency of LLM-recommended foods for glucose management. Results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently provides personalized dietary recommendations to reduce average glucose iAUC across three time windows, which outperforms the previous approach. LLM-as-a-judge evaluation results indicate that our proposed method enhances personalization in the reasoning process.

<title>When Trust Collides: Decoding Human-LLM Cooperation Dynamics through the Prisoner's Dilemma</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable of autonomous decision-making, they introduce new challenges and opportunities for human-AI cooperation in mixed-motive contexts. While prior research has primarily examined AI in assistive or cooperative roles, little is known about how humans interact with AI agents perceived as independent and strategic actors. This study investigates human cooperative attitudes and behaviors toward LLM agents by engaging 30 participants (15 males, 15 females) in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games with agents differing in declared identity: purported human, rule-based AI, and LLM agent. Behavioral metrics, including cooperation rate, decision latency, unsolicited cooperative acts and trust restoration tolerance, were analyzed to assess the influence of agent identity and participant gender. Results revealed significant effects of declared agent identity on most cooperation-related behaviors, along with notable gender differences in decision latency. Furthermore, qualitative responses suggest that these behavioral differences were shaped by participants interpretations and expectations of the agents. These findings contribute to our understanding of human adaptation in competitive cooperation with autonomous agents and underscore the importance of agent framing in shaping effective and ethical human-AI interaction.

Abstract: This study examines how public discourse around COVID-19 unfolded on Twitter through the lens of crisis communication and digital publics. Analyzing over 275,000 tweets involving the CDC, we identify 16 distinct discourse clusters shaped by framing, sentiment, credibility, and network dynamics. We find that CDC messaging became a flashpoint for affective and ideological polarization, with users aligning along competing frames of science vs. freedom, and public health vs. political overreach. Most clusters formed echo chambers, while a few enabled cross cutting dialogue. Publics emerged not only around ideology but also around topical and emotional stakes, reflecting shifting concerns across different stages of the pandemic. While marginalized communities raised consistent equity concerns, these narratives struggled to reshape broader discourse. Our findings highlight the importance of long-term, adaptive engagement with diverse publics and propose design interventions such as multi-agent AI assistants, to support more inclusive communication throughout extended public health crises.

<title>Agent-Centric Personalized Multiple Clustering with Multi-Modal LLMs</title>

Abstract: Personalized multiple clustering aims to generate diverse partitions of a dataset based on different user-specific aspects, rather than a single clustering. It has recently drawn research interest for accommodating varying user preferences. Recent approaches primarily use CLIP embeddings with proxy learning to extract representations biased toward user clustering preferences. However, CLIP primarily focuses on coarse image-text alignment, lacking a deep contextual understanding of user interests. To overcome these limitations, we propose an agent-centric personalized clustering framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as agents to comprehensively traverse a relational graph to search for clusters based on user interests. Due to the advanced reasoning mechanism of MLLMs, the obtained clusters align more closely with user-defined criteria than those obtained from CLIP-based representations. To reduce computational overhead, we shorten the agents' traversal path by constructing a relational graph using user-interest-biased embeddings extracted by MLLMs. A large number of weakly connected edges can be filtered out based on embedding similarity, facilitating an efficient traversal search for agents. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves NMI scores of 0.9667 and 0.9481 on the Card Order and Card Suits benchmarks, respectively, largely improving the SOTA model by over 140%.

Abstract: What drives exploration? Understanding intrinsic motivation is a long-standing challenge in both cognitive science and artificial intelligence; numerous objectives have been proposed and used to train agents, yet there remains a gap between human and agent exploration. We directly compare adults, children, and AI agents in a complex open-ended environment, Crafter, and study how common intrinsic objectives: Entropy, Information Gain, and Empowerment, relate to their behavior. We find that only Entropy and Empowerment are consistently positively correlated with human exploration progress, indicating that these objectives may better inform intrinsic reward design for agents. Furthermore, across agents and humans we observe that Entropy initially increases rapidly, then plateaus, while Empowerment increases continuously, suggesting that state diversity may provide more signal in early exploration, while advanced exploration should prioritize control. Finally, we find preliminary evidence that private speech utterances, and particularly goal verbalizations, may aid exploration in children. Our data is available at https://github.com/alyd/humans_in_crafter_data.

Abstract: In the interaction between agents and their environments, agents expand their capabilities by planning and executing actions. However, LLM-based agents face substantial challenges when deployed in novel environments or required to navigate unconventional action spaces. To empower agents to autonomously explore environments, optimize workflows, and enhance their understanding of actions, we propose SynWorld, a framework that allows agents to synthesize possible scenarios with multi-step action invocation within the action space and perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration to effectively refine their action knowledge in the current environment. Our experiments demonstrate that SynWorld is an effective and general approach to learning action knowledge in new environments. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/SynWorld.

Abstract: Tracking financial investments in climate adaptation is a complex and expertise-intensive task, particularly for Early Warning Systems (EWS), which lack standardized financial reporting across multilateral development banks (MDBs) and funds. To address this challenge, we introduce an LLM-based agentic AI system that integrates contextual retrieval, fine-tuning, and multi-step reasoning to extract relevant financial data, classify investments, and ensure compliance with funding guidelines. Our study focuses on a real-world application: tracking EWS investments in the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Fund. We analyze 25 MDB project documents and evaluate multiple AI-driven classification methods, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, fine-tuned transformer-based classifiers, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and an agent-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach. Our results show that the agent-based RAG approach significantly outperforms other methods, achieving 87\% accuracy, 89\% precision, and 83\% recall. Additionally, we contribute a benchmark dataset and expert-annotated corpus, providing a valuable resource for future research in AI-driven financial tracking and climate finance transparency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict swarm-like constraints-limited local perception and communication-remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\times k$ view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of leading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent performance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our results indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust long-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty inherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like constraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized intelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built on a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive datasets. This aims to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of emergent collective behavior under severe informational decentralization. Our code repository is available at https://github.com/x66ccff/swarmbench.

Abstract: Agentic systems, in which diverse agents cooperate to tackle challenging problems, are exploding in popularity in the AI community. However, the agentic frameworks used to build these systems have not previously enabled use with research cyberinfrastructure. Here we introduce Academy, a modular and extensible middleware designed to deploy autonomous agents across the federated research ecosystem, including HPC systems, experimental facilities, and data repositories. To meet the demands of scientific computing, Academy supports asynchronous execution, heterogeneous resources, high-throughput data flows, and dynamic resource availability. It provides abstractions for expressing stateful agents, managing inter-agent coordination, and integrating computation with experimental control. We present microbenchmark results that demonstrate high performance and scalability in HPC environments. To demonstrate the breadth of applications that can be supported by agentic workflow designs, we also present case studies in materials discovery, decentralized learning, and information extraction in which agents are deployed across diverse HPC systems.

Abstract: We study rational synthesis problems for concurrent games with $\omega$-regular objectives. Our model of rationality considers only pure strategy Nash equilibria that satisfy either a social welfare or Pareto optimality condition with respect to an $\omega$-regular objective for each agent. This extends earlier work on equilibria in concurrent games, without consideration about their quality. Our results show that the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying social welfare conditions can be computed as efficiently as the constrained Nash equilibrium existence problem. On the other hand, the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying the Pareto optimality condition possibly involves a higher upper bound, except in the case of B\"uchi and Muller games, for which all three problems are in the classes P and PSPACE-complete, respectively.

arXiv:2410.18774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A challenging problem in decentralized optimization is to develop algorithms with fast convergence on random and time varying topologies under unreliable and bandwidth-constrained communication network. This paper studies a stochastic approximation approach with a Fully Stochastic Primal Dual Algorithm (FSPDA) framework. Our framework relies on a novel observation that randomness in time varying topology can be incorporated in a stochastic augmented Lagrangian formulation, whose expected value admits saddle points that coincide with stationary solutions of the decentralized optimization problem. With the FSPDA framework, we develop two new algorithms supporting efficient sparsified communication on random time varying topologies -- FSPDA-SA allows agents to execute multiple local gradient steps depending on the time varying topology to accelerate convergence, and FSPDA-STORM further incorporates a variance reduction step to improve sample complexity. For problems with smooth (possibly non-convex) objective function, within $T$ iterations, we show that FSPDA-SA (resp. FSPDA-STORM) finds an $\mathcal{O}( 1/\sqrt{T} )$-stationary (resp. $\mathcal{O}( 1/T^{2/3} )$) solution. Numerical experiments show the benefits of the FSPDA algorithms.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider combinatorial reinforcement learning with preference feedback, where a learning agent sequentially offers an action--an assortment of multiple items to--a user, whose preference feedback follows a multinomial logistic (MNL) model. This framework allows us to model real-world scenarios, particularly those involving long-term user engagement, such as in recommender systems and online advertising. However, this framework faces two main challenges: (1) the unknown value of each item, unlike traditional MNL bandits that only address single-step preference feedback, and (2) the difficulty of ensuring optimism while maintaining tractable assortment selection in the combinatorial action space with unknown values. In this paper, we assume a contextual MNL preference model, where the mean utilities are linear, and the value of each item is approximated by a general function. We propose an algorithm, MNL-VQL, that addresses these challenges, making it both computationally and statistically efficient. As a special case, for linear MDPs (with the MNL preference feedback), we establish the first regret lower bound in this framework and show that MNL-VQL achieves nearly minimax-optimal regret. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide statistical guarantees in combinatorial RL with preference feedback.

Abstract: Meta-analysis is a systematic research methodology that synthesizes data from multiple existing studies to derive comprehensive conclusions. This approach not only mitigates limitations inherent in individual studies but also facilitates novel discoveries through integrated data analysis. Traditional meta-analysis involves a complex multi-stage pipeline including literature retrieval, paper screening, and data extraction, which demands substantial human effort and time. However, while LLM-based methods can accelerate certain stages, they still face significant challenges, such as hallucinations in paper screening and data extraction. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system, Manalyzer, which achieves end-to-end automated meta-analysis through tool calls. The hybrid review, hierarchical extraction, self-proving, and feedback checking strategies implemented in Manalyzer significantly alleviate these two hallucinations. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of meta-analysis, we construct a new benchmark comprising 729 papers across 3 domains, encompassing text, image, and table modalities, with over 10,000 data points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Manalyzer achieves significant performance improvements over the LLM baseline in multi meta-analysis tasks.

Abstract: During job recruitment, traditional applicant selection methods often lack transparency. Candidates are rarely given sufficient justifications for recruiting decisions, whether they are made manually by human recruiters or through the use of black-box Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). To address this problem, our work introduces a multi-agent AI system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide job seekers during the recruitment process. Using an iterative user-centric design approach, we first conducted a two-phased exploratory study with four active job seekers to inform the design and development of the system. Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth, qualitative user study with 20 active job seekers through individual one-to-one interviews to evaluate the developed prototype. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that participants perceived our multi-agent recruitment system as significantly more actionable, trustworthy, and fair compared to traditional methods. Our study further helped us uncover in-depth insights into factors contributing to these perceived user experiences. Drawing from these insights, we offer broader design implications for building user-aligned, multi-agent explainable AI systems across diverse domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in ranking systems such as information retrieval (IR) systems and recommender systems (RSs). To alleviate the latency of auto-regressive decoding, some studies explore the single (first) token decoding for ranking approximation, but they suffer from severe degradation in tail positions. Although speculative decoding (SD) methods can be a remedy with verification at different positions, they face challenges in ranking systems due to their left-to-right decoding paradigm. Firstly, ranking systems require strict latency constraints, but verification rounds in SD methods remain agnostic; Secondly, SD methods usually discard listwise ranking knowledge about unaccepted items in previous rounds, hindering future multi-token prediction, especially when candidate tokens are the unaccepted items. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Speculative Decoding method for fast ranking inference of LLMs. To meet the ranking systems' latency requirement, we propose an up-to-down decoding paradigm that employs an agent to iteratively modify the ranking sequence under a constrained budget. Specifically, we design a ranking-tailored policy optimization, actively exploring optimal multi-round ranking modification policy verified by LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). To better approximate the target LLM under the constrained budget, we trigger the agent fully utilizing the listwise ranking knowledge about all items verified by LLMs across different rounds in RL, enhancing the modification policy of the agent. More importantly, we demonstrate the theoretical robustness and advantages of our paradigm and implementation. Experiments on both IR and RS tasks show the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Biomedical researchers increasingly rely on large-scale structured databases for complex analytical tasks. However, current text-to-SQL systems often struggle to map qualitative scientific questions into executable SQL, particularly when implicit domain reasoning is required. We introduce BiomedSQL, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate scientific reasoning in text-to-SQL generation over a real-world biomedical knowledge base. BiomedSQL comprises 68,000 question/SQL query/answer triples grounded in a harmonized BigQuery knowledge base that integrates gene-disease associations, causal inference from omics data, and drug approval records. Each question requires models to infer domain-specific criteria, such as genome-wide significance thresholds, effect directionality, or trial phase filtering, rather than rely on syntactic translation alone. We evaluate a range of open- and closed-source LLMs across prompting strategies and interaction paradigms. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap: GPT-o3-mini achieves 59.0% execution accuracy, while our custom multi-step agent, BMSQL, reaches 62.6%, both well below the expert baseline of 90.0%. BiomedSQL provides a new foundation for advancing text-to-SQL systems capable of supporting scientific discovery through robust reasoning over structured biomedical knowledge bases. Our dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/NIH-CARD/BiomedSQL, and our code is open-source at https://github.com/NIH-CARD/biomedsql.

Abstract: Efficient energy management in prosumer households is key to alleviating grid stress in an energy transition marked by electric vehicles (EV), renewable energies and battery storage. However, it is unclear how households optimize prosumer EV charging. Here we study real-world data from 90 households on fixed-rate electricity tariffs in German-speaking countries to investigate the potential of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and other control approaches (Rule-Based, Model Predictive Control) to manage the dynamic and uncertain environment of Home Energy Management (HEM) and optimize household charging patterns. The DRL agent efficiently aligns charging of EV and battery storage with photovoltaic (PV) surplus. We find that frequent EV charging transactions, early EV connections and PV surplus increase optimization potential. A detailed analysis of nine households (1 hour resolution, 1 year) demonstrates that high battery capacity facilitates self optimization; in this case further algorithmic control shows little value. In cases with relatively low battery capacity, algorithmic control with DRL improves energy management and cost savings by a relevant margin. This result is further corroborated by our simulation of a synthetic household. We conclude that prosumer households with optimization potential would profit from DRL, thus benefiting also the full electricity system and its decarbonization.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have shown promising capabilities in a growing range of software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, advancing this field faces two critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to contamination issues.

Abstract: Motion forecasts of road users (i.e., agents) vary in complexity as a function of scene constraints and interactive behavior. We address this with a multi-task learning method for motion forecasting that includes a retrocausal flow of information. The corresponding tasks are to forecast (1) marginal trajectory distributions for all modeled agents and (2) joint trajectory distributions for interacting agents. Using a transformer model, we generate the joint distributions by re-encoding marginal distributions followed by pairwise modeling. This incorporates a retrocausal flow of information from later points in marginal trajectories to earlier points in joint trajectories. Per trajectory point, we model positional uncertainty using compressed exponential power distributions. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art results in the Waymo Interaction Prediction dataset and generalizes well to the Argoverse 2 dataset. Additionally, our method provides an interface for issuing instructions through trajectory modifications. Our experiments show that regular training of motion forecasting leads to the ability to follow goal-based instructions and to adapt basic directional instructions to the scene context.

Abstract: Visual imitation learning enables robotic agents to acquire skills by observing expert demonstration videos. In the one-shot setting, the agent generates a policy after observing a single expert demonstration without additional fine-tuning. Existing approaches typically train and evaluate on the same set of tasks, varying only object configurations, and struggle to generalize to unseen tasks with different semantic or structural requirements. While some recent methods attempt to address this, they exhibit low success rates on hard test tasks that, despite being visually similar to some training tasks, differ in context and require distinct responses. Additionally, most existing methods lack an explicit model of environment dynamics, limiting their ability to reason about future states. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for one-shot visual imitation learning via world-model-guided trajectory generation. Given an expert demonstration video and the agent's initial observation, our method leverages a learned world model to predict a sequence of latent states and actions. This latent trajectory is then decoded into physical waypoints that guide the agent's execution. Our method is evaluated on two simulated benchmarks and three real-world robotic platforms, where it consistently outperforms prior approaches, with over 30% improvement in some cases.

<title>Reconceptualizing Smart Microscopy: From Data Collection to Knowledge Creation by Multi-Agent Integration</title>

Abstract: Smart microscopy represents a paradigm shift in biological imaging, moving from passive observation tools to active collaborators in scientific inquiry. Enabled by advances in automation, computational power, and artificial intelligence, these systems are now capable of adaptive decision-making and real-time experimental control. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework that reconceptualizes smart microscopy as a partner in scientific investigation. Central to our framework is the concept of the 'epistemic-empirical divide' in cellular investigation-the gap between what is observable (empirical domain) and what must be understood (epistemic domain). We propose six core design principles: epistemic-empirical awareness, hierarchical context integration, an evolution from detection to perception, adaptive measurement frameworks, narrative synthesis capabilities, and cross-contextual reasoning. Together, these principles guide a multi-agent architecture designed to align empirical observation with the goals of scientific understanding. Our framework provides a roadmap for building microscopy systems that go beyond automation to actively support hypothesis generation, insight discovery, and theory development, redefining the role of scientific instruments in the process of knowledge creation.

<title>CPathAgent: An Agent-based Foundation Model for Interpretable High-Resolution Pathology Image Analysis Mimicking Pathologists' Diagnostic Logic</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology have led to the emergence of numerous foundation models. However, these approaches fail to replicate the diagnostic process of pathologists, as they either simply rely on general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for classification or directly apply multimodal models to generate reports from images. A significant limitation is their inability to emulate the diagnostic logic employed by pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification for overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based model that mimics pathologists' reasoning processes by autonomously executing zoom-in/out and navigation operations across pathology images based on observed visual features. To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy unifying patch-level, region-level, and whole-slide capabilities within a single model, which is essential for mimicking pathologists, who require understanding and reasoning capabilities across all three scales. This approach generates substantially more detailed and interpretable diagnostic reports compared to existing methods, particularly for huge region understanding. Additionally, we construct an expert-validated PathMMU-HR$^{2}$, the first benchmark for huge region analysis, a critical intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, as diagnosticians typically examine several key regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across three scales of benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for the future development of computational pathology.

<title>Project Riley: Multimodal Multi-Agent LLM Collaboration with Emotional Reasoning and Voting</title>

Abstract: This paper presents Project Riley, a novel multimodal and multi-model conversational AI architecture oriented towards the simulation of reasoning influenced by emotional states. Drawing inspiration from Pixar's Inside Out, the system comprises five distinct emotional agents - Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust - that engage in structured multi-round dialogues to generate, criticise, and iteratively refine responses. A final reasoning mechanism synthesises the contributions of these agents into a coherent output that either reflects the dominant emotion or integrates multiple perspectives. The architecture incorporates both textual and visual large language models (LLMs), alongside advanced reasoning and self-refinement processes. A functional prototype was deployed locally in an offline environment, optimised for emotional expressiveness and computational efficiency. From this initial prototype, another one emerged, called Armando, which was developed for use in emergency contexts, delivering emotionally calibrated and factually accurate information through the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and cumulative context tracking. The Project Riley prototype was evaluated through user testing, in which participants interacted with the chatbot and completed a structured questionnaire assessing three dimensions: Emotional Appropriateness, Clarity and Utility, and Naturalness and Human-likeness. The results indicate strong performance in structured scenarios, particularly with respect to emotional alignment and communicative clarity.

<title>Learning a Pessimistic Reward Model in RLHF</title>

Abstract: This work proposes `PET', a novel pessimistic reward fine-tuning method, to learn a pessimistic reward model robust against reward hacking in offline reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Traditional reward modeling techniques in RLHF train an imperfect reward model, on which a KL regularization plays a pivotal role in mitigating reward hacking when optimizing a policy. Such an intuition-based method still suffers from reward hacking, and the policies with large KL divergence from the dataset distribution are excluded during learning. In contrast, we show that when optimizing a policy on a pessimistic reward model fine-tuned through PET, reward hacking can be prevented without relying on any regularization. We test our methods on the standard TL;DR summarization dataset. We find that one can learn a high-quality policy on our pessimistic reward without using any regularization. Such a policy has a high KL divergence from the dataset distribution while having high performance in practice. In summary, our work shows the feasibility of learning a pessimistic reward model against reward hacking. The agent can greedily search for the policy with a high pessimistic reward without suffering from reward hacking.

<title>Byzantine-Resilient Distributed P2P Energy Trading via Spatial-Temporal Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading mandates an escalating coupling between the physical power network and communication network, necessitating high-frequency sharing of real-time data among prosumers. However, this data-sharing scheme renders the system vulnerable to various malicious behaviors, as Byzantine agents can initiate cyberattacks by injecting sophisticated false data. To better investigate the impacts of malicious Byzantine faults, this paper develops a fully distributed P2P energy trading model by accounting for the high-fidelity physical network constraints. To further detect Byzantine faults and mitigate their impacts on distributed P2P energy trading problem, we propose an online spatial-temporal anomaly detection approach by leveraging the tensor learning method, which is informed by the domain knowledge to enable awesome detection performance. Moreover, to enhance its computational efficiency, we further develop closed-form solutions for the proposed detection approach. Subsequently, we derive theoretical conditions for guaranteeing optimality and convergence of the distributed P2P energy trading problem with anomaly detection mechanisms. Results from numerical simulations validate the effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal graph neural networks has demonstrated that augmenting atomic XYZ geometries with textual chemical descriptors can enhance predictive accuracy across a range of electronic and thermodynamic properties. However, naively appending large sets of heterogeneous descriptors often degrades performance on tasks sensitive to molecular shape or symmetry, and undermines interpretability. xChemAgents proposes a cooperative agent framework that injects physics-aware reasoning into multimodal property prediction. xChemAgents comprises two language-model-based agents: a Selector, which adaptively identifies a sparse, weighted subset of descriptors relevant to each target, and provides a natural language rationale; and a Validator, which enforces physical constraints such as unit consistency and scaling laws through iterative dialogue. On standard benchmark datasets, xChemAgents achieves up to a 22\% reduction in mean absolute error over strong baselines, while producing faithful, human-interpretable explanations. Experiment results highlight the potential of cooperative, self-verifying agents to enhance both accuracy and transparency in foundation-model-driven materials science. The implementation and accompanying dataset are available anonymously at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/xChemAgents.

<title>Synergising Hierarchical Data Centers and Power Networks: A Privacy-Preserving Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20575</link>

Abstract: In the era of digitization, data centers have emerged as integral contributors sustaining our interlinked world, bearing responsibility for an increasing proportion of the world's energy consumption. To facilitate the their fast rollout while progressing towards net-zero energy systems, the synergy of hierarchical data centers (cloud-fog-edge) and power networks can play a pivotal role. However, existing centralized co-dispatch manners encroach on the privacy of different agents within the integrated systems, meanwhile suffering from the combinatorial explosion. In this research, we propose a near-optimal distributed privacy-preserving approach to solve the non-convex synergy (day-ahead co-dispatch) problem. The synergy problem is formulated as a mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming considering both communication and energy conservation, where Lyapunov optimization is introduced to balance operating costs and uncertain communication delays. To mitigate impacts of the highly non-convex nature, the normalized multi-parametric disaggregation technique is leveraged to reformulate the problem into a mixed integer non-linear programming. To further overcome non-smoothness of the reformulated problem, the customized $\ell_1-$surrogate Lagrangian relaxation method with convergence guarantees is proposed to solve the problem in a distributed privacy-preserving manner. {The effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed methodologies for the synergy problem are validated via numerical simulations. Simulation results also indicate that computing tasks can be delayed and migrated within the hierarchical data centers, demonstrating the flexible resource allocation capabilities of the hierarchical data center architecture, further facilitating peak load balancing in the power network.

<title>The challenge of hidden gifts in multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>

Abstract: Sometimes we benefit from actions that others have taken even when we are unaware that they took those actions. For example, if your neighbor chooses not to take a parking spot in front of your house when you are not there, you can benefit, even without being aware that they took this action. These "hidden gifts" represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others are hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a very simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have individual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if all the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward. However, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective reward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they use it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents have dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a "hidden gift". We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including MARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this simple task. Interestingly, we find that independent model-free policy gradient agents can solve the task when we provide them with information about their own action history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action history. Finally, we derive a correction term for these independent agents, inspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning and helps them to converge to collective success more reliably. These results show that credit assignment in multi-agent settings can be particularly challenging in the presence of "hidden gifts", and demonstrate that learning awareness in independent agents can benefit these settings.

<title>Long Context Scaling: Divide and Conquer via Multi-Agent Question-driven Collaboration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Processing long contexts has become a critical capability for modern large language models (LLMs). Existing works leverage agent-based divide-and-conquer methods for processing long contexts. But these methods face crucial limitations, including prohibitive accumulated latency and amplified information loss from excessive agent invocations, and the disruption of inherent textual dependencies by immoderate partitioning. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent framework XpandA (Expand-Agent) coupled with question-driven workflow and dynamic partitioning for robust long-context processing. XpandA overcomes these limitations through: 1) dynamic partitioning of long texts, which adaptively modulates the filling rate of context windows for input sequences of vastly varying lengths; 2) question-guided protocol to update flat information ensembles within centralized shared memory, constructing consistent inter-agent knowledge across partitions; and 3) selectively replaying specific partitions based on the state-tracking of question-information couples to promote the resolution of inverted-order structures across partitions (e.g., flashbacks). We perform a comprehensive evaluation of XpandA on multiple long-context benchmarks with length varying from 1k to 1M, demonstrating XpandA's feasibility for processing ultra-long sequences and its significant effectiveness in enhancing the long-context capabilities of various LLMs by achieving 20\% improvements and 1.5x inference speedup over baselines of full-context, RAG and previous agent-based methods.

Abstract: Existing Embodied Question Answering (EQA) benchmarks primarily focus on household environments, often overlooking safety-critical aspects and reasoning processes pertinent to industrial settings. This drawback limits the evaluation of agent readiness for real-world industrial applications. To bridge this, we introduce IndustryEQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating embodied agent capabilities within safety-critical warehouse scenarios. Built upon the NVIDIA Isaac Sim platform, IndustryEQA provides high-fidelity episodic memory videos featuring diverse industrial assets, dynamic human agents, and carefully designed hazardous situations inspired by real-world safety guidelines. The benchmark includes rich annotations covering six categories: equipment safety, human safety, object recognition, attribute recognition, temporal understanding, and spatial understanding. Besides, it also provides extra reasoning evaluation based on these categories. Specifically, it comprises 971 question-answer pairs generated from small warehouse and 373 pairs from large ones, incorporating scenarios with and without human. We further propose a comprehensive evaluation framework, including various baseline models, to assess their general perception and reasoning abilities in industrial environments. IndustryEQA aims to steer EQA research towards developing more robust, safety-aware, and practically applicable embodied agents for complex industrial environments. Benchmark and codes are available.

<title>CoderAgent: Simulating Student Behavior for Personalized Programming Learning with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Personalized programming tutoring, such as exercise recommendation, can enhance learners' efficiency, motivation, and outcomes, which is increasingly important in modern digital education. However, the lack of sufficient and high-quality programming data, combined with the mismatch between offline evaluation and real-world learning, hinders the practical deployment of such systems. To address this challenge, many approaches attempt to simulate learner practice data, yet they often overlook the fine-grained, iterative nature of programming learning, resulting in a lack of interpretability and granularity. To fill this gap, we propose a LLM-based agent, CoderAgent, to simulate students' programming processes in a fine-grained manner without relying on real data. Specifically, we equip each human learner with an intelligent agent, the core of which lies in capturing the cognitive states of the human programming practice process. Inspired by ACT-R, a cognitive architecture framework, we design the structure of CoderAgent to align with human cognitive architecture by focusing on the mastery of programming knowledge and the application of coding ability. Recognizing the inherent patterns in multi-layered cognitive reasoning, we introduce the Programming Tree of Thought (PTOT), which breaks down the process into four steps: why, how, where, and what. This approach enables a detailed analysis of iterative problem-solving strategies. Finally, experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that CoderAgent provides interpretable insights into learning trajectories and achieves accurate simulations, paving the way for personalized programming education.

Abstract: For reinforcement learning agents to be deployed in high-risk settings, they must achieve a high level of robustness to unfamiliar scenarios. One method for improving robustness is unsupervised environment design (UED), a suite of methods aiming to maximise an agent's generalisability across configurations of an environment. In this work, we study UED from an optimisation perspective, providing stronger theoretical guarantees for practical settings than prior work. Whereas previous methods relied on guarantees if they reach convergence, our framework employs a nonconvex-strongly-concave objective for which we provide a provably convergent algorithm in the zero-sum setting. We empirically verify the efficacy of our method, outperforming prior methods in a number of environments with varying difficulties.

arXiv:2505.20660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have gained substantial attention due to their impressive capabilities to complete tasks through multiple interactions within GUI environments. However, existing agents primarily focus on enhancing the accuracy of individual actions and often lack effective mechanisms for detecting and recovering from errors. To address these shortcomings, we propose the BacktrackAgent, a robust framework that incorporates a backtracking mechanism to improve task completion efficiency. BacktrackAgent includes verifier, judger, and reflector components as modules for error detection and recovery, while also applying judgment rewards to further enhance the agent's performance. Additionally, we develop a training dataset specifically designed for the backtracking mechanism, which considers the outcome pages after action executions. Experimental results show that BacktrackAgent has achieved performance improvements in both task success rate and step accuracy on Mobile3M and Auto-UI benchmarks. Our data and code will be released upon acceptance.

arXiv:2505.20662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient experiment reproduction is critical to accelerating progress in artificial intelligence. However, the inherent complexity of method design and training procedures presents substantial challenges for automation. Notably, reproducing experiments often requires implicit domain-specific knowledge not explicitly documented in the original papers. To address this, we introduce the paper lineage algorithm, which identifies and extracts implicit knowledge from the relevant references cited by the target paper. Building on this idea, we propose AutoReproduce, a multi-agent framework capable of automatically reproducing experiments described in research papers in an end-to-end manner. AutoReproduce enhances code executability by generating unit tests alongside the reproduction process. To evaluate the reproduction capability, we construct ReproduceBench, a benchmark annotated with verified implementations, and introduce novel evaluation metrics to assess both the reproduction and execution fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoReproduce outperforms the existing strong agent baselines on all five evaluation metrics by a peak margin of over $70\%$. In particular, compared to the official implementations, AutoReproduce achieves an average performance gap of $22.1\%$ on $89.74\%$ of the executable experiment runs. The code will be available at https://github.com/AI9Stars/AutoReproduce.

<title>MIRROR: Multi-agent Intra- and Inter-Reflection for Optimized Reasoning in Tool Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex tasks involving tool integration pose significant challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to the emergence of multi-agent workflows as a promising solution. Reflection has emerged as an effective strategy for correcting erroneous trajectories in agentic workflows. However, existing approaches only exploit such capability in the post-action stage, where the agent observes the execution outcomes. We argue that, like humans, LLMs can also engage in reflection before action execution: the agent can anticipate undesirable outcomes from its own decisions, which not only provides a necessarily complementary perspective to evaluate the decision but also prevents the propagation of errors throughout the trajectory. In this paper, we propose MIRROR, a framework that consists of both intra-reflection, which critically assesses intended actions before execution, and inter-reflection, which further adjusts the trajectory based on observations. This design systematically leverages LLM reflection capabilities to eliminate and rectify erroneous actions on a more comprehensive scope. Evaluations on both the StableToolBench and TravelPlanner benchmarks demonstrate MIRROR's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results compared to existing approaches.

<title>LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning: Addressing Training Bottlenecks through Policy Modulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved notable success in various domains, training effective policies for complex tasks remains challenging. Agents often converge to local optima and fail to maximize long-term rewards. Existing approaches to mitigate training bottlenecks typically fall into two categories: (i) Automated policy refinement, which identifies critical states from past trajectories to guide policy updates, but suffers from costly and uncertain model training; and (ii) Human-in-the-loop refinement, where human feedback is used to correct agent behavior, but this does not scale well to environments with large or continuous action spaces. In this work, we design a large language model-guided policy modulation framework that leverages LLMs to improve RL training without additional model training or human intervention. We first prompt an LLM to identify critical states from a sub-optimal agent's trajectories. Based on these states, the LLM then provides action suggestions and assigns implicit rewards to guide policy refinement. Experiments across standard RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based explanations in addressing RL training bottlenecks.

<title>GIFARC: Synthetic Dataset for Leveraging Human-Intuitive Analogies to Elevate AI Reasoning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) poses a stringent test of general AI capabilities, requiring solvers to infer abstract patterns from only a handful of examples. Despite substantial progress in deep learning, state-of-the-art models still achieve accuracy rates of merely 40-55% on 2024 ARC Competition, indicative of a significant gap between their performance and human-level reasoning. In this work, we seek to bridge that gap by introducing an analogy-inspired ARC dataset, GIFARC. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), we synthesize new ARC-style tasks from a variety of GIF images that include analogies. Each new task is paired with ground-truth analogy, providing an explicit mapping between visual transformations and everyday concepts. By embedding robust human-intuitive analogies into ARC-style tasks, GIFARC guides AI agents to evaluate the task analogically before engaging in brute-force pattern search, thus efficiently reducing problem complexity and build a more concise and human-understandable solution. We empirically validate that guiding LLM with analogic approach with GIFARC affects task-solving approaches of LLMs to align with analogic approach of human.

Abstract: User-Centric Embodied Visual Tracking (UC-EVT) presents a novel challenge for reinforcement learning-based models due to the substantial gap between high-level user instructions and low-level agent actions. While recent advancements in language models (e.g., LLMs, VLMs, VLAs) have improved instruction comprehension, these models face critical limitations in either inference speed (LLMs, VLMs) or generalizability (VLAs) for UC-EVT tasks. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Hierarchical Instruction-aware Embodied Visual Tracking (HIEVT)} agent, which bridges instruction comprehension and action generation using \textit{spatial goals} as intermediaries. HIEVT first introduces \textit{LLM-based Semantic-Spatial Goal Aligner} to translate diverse human instructions into spatial goals that directly annotate the desired spatial position. Then the \textit{RL-based Adaptive Goal-Aligned Policy}, a general offline policy, enables the tracker to position the target as specified by the spatial goal. To benchmark UC-EVT tasks, we collect over ten million trajectories for training and evaluate across one seen environment and nine unseen challenging environments. Extensive experiments and real-world deployments demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of HIEVT across diverse environments, varying target dynamics, and complex instruction combinations.

Abstract: We introduce a novel self-improving framework that enhances Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address the limitations of current active visual tracking systems in recovering from tracking failure. Our approach combines the off-the-shelf active tracking methods with VLMs' reasoning capabilities, deploying a fast visual policy for normal tracking and activating VLM reasoning only upon failure detection. The framework features a memory-augmented self-reflection mechanism that enables the VLM to progressively improve by learning from past experiences, effectively addressing VLMs' limitations in 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements, with our framework boosting success rates by $72\%$ with state-of-the-art RL-based approaches and $220\%$ with PID-based methods in challenging environments. This work represents the first integration of VLM-based reasoning to assist EVT agents in proactive failure recovery, offering substantial advances for real-world robotic applications that require continuous target monitoring in dynamic, unstructured environments.

Abstract: Efficient maintenance has always been essential for the successful application of engineering systems. However, the challenges to be overcome in the implementation of Industry 4.0 necessitate new paradigms of maintenance optimization. Machine learning techniques are becoming increasingly used in engineering and maintenance, with reinforcement learning being one of the most promising. In this paper, we propose a gamma degradation process together with a novel maintenance model in which repairs are increasingly imperfect, i.e., the beneficial effect of system repairs decreases as more repairs are performed, reflecting the degradational behavior of real-world systems. To generate maintenance policies for this system, we developed a reinforcement-learning-based agent using a Double Deep Q-Network architecture. This agent presents two important advantages: it works without a predefined preventive threshold, and it can operate in a continuous degradation state space. Our agent learns to behave in different scenarios, showing great flexibility. In addition, we performed an analysis of how changes in the main parameters of the environment affect the maintenance policy proposed by the agent. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be appropriate and to significatively improve long-run cost as compared with other common maintenance strategies.

Abstract: Building embodied agents capable of accomplishing arbitrary tasks is a core objective towards achieving embodied artificial general intelligence (E-AGI). While recent work has advanced such general robot policies, their training and evaluation are often limited to tasks within specific scenes, involving restricted instructions and scenarios. Existing benchmarks also typically rely on manual annotation of limited tasks in a few scenes. We argue that exploring the full spectrum of feasible tasks within any given scene is crucial, as they provide both extensive benchmarks for evaluation and valuable resources for agent improvement. Towards this end, we introduce ManiTaskGen, a novel system that automatically generates comprehensive, diverse, feasible mobile manipulation tasks for any given scene. The generated tasks encompass both process-based, specific instructions (e.g., "move object from X to Y") and outcome-based, abstract instructions (e.g., "clear the table"). We apply ManiTaskGen to both simulated and real-world scenes, demonstrating the validity and diversity of the generated tasks. We then leverage these tasks to automatically construct benchmarks, thoroughly evaluating the embodied decision-making capabilities of agents built upon existing vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method that utilizes ManiTaskGen tasks to enhance embodied decision-making. Overall, this work presents a universal task generation framework for arbitrary scenes, facilitating both benchmarking and improvement of embodied decision-making agents.

<title>SPA-RL: Reinforcing LLM Agents via Stepwise Progress Attribution</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) holds significant promise for training LLM agents to handle complex, goal-oriented tasks that require multi-step interactions with external environments. However, a critical challenge when applying RL to these agentic tasks arises from delayed rewards: feedback signals are typically available only after the entire task is completed. This makes it non-trivial to assign delayed rewards to earlier actions, providing insufficient guidance regarding environmental constraints and hindering agent training. In this work, we draw on the insight that the ultimate completion of a task emerges from the cumulative progress an agent makes across individual steps. We propose Stepwise Progress Attribution (SPA), a general reward redistribution framework that decomposes the final reward into stepwise contributions, each reflecting its incremental progress toward overall task completion. To achieve this, we train a progress estimator that accumulates stepwise contributions over a trajectory to match the task completion. During policy optimization, we combine the estimated per-step contribution with a grounding signal for actions executed in the environment as the fine-grained, intermediate reward for effective agent training. Extensive experiments on common agent benchmarks (including Webshop, ALFWorld, and VirtualHome) demonstrate that SPA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method in both success rate (+2.5\% on average) and grounding accuracy (+1.9\% on average). Further analyses demonstrate that our method remarkably provides more effective intermediate rewards for RL training. Our code is available at https://github.com/WangHanLinHenry/SPA-RL-Agent.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited extraordinary performance in a variety of tasks while it remains challenging for them to solve complex multi-step tasks as agents. In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO). Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.

Abstract: LLM-based agent systems are emerging as a new software paradigm and have been widely adopted across diverse domains such as medicine, robotics, and programming. However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e., bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AGENTISSUE-BENCH, a reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate state-of-the-art SE agents on AGENTISSUE-BENCH and reveal their limited effectiveness (i.e., with only 3.33% - 12.67% resolution rates). These results underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues.

<title>Rethinking Information Synthesis in Multimodal Question Answering A Multi-Agent Perspective</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal question answering have primarily focused on combining heterogeneous modalities or fine-tuning multimodal large language models. While these approaches have shown strong performance, they often rely on a single, generalized reasoning strategy, overlooking the unique characteristics of each modality ultimately limiting both accuracy and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose MAMMQA, a multi-agent QA framework for multimodal inputs spanning text, tables, and images. Our system includes two Visual Language Model (VLM) agents and one text-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The first VLM decomposes the user query into sub-questions and sequentially retrieves partial answers from each modality. The second VLM synthesizes and refines these results through cross-modal reasoning. Finally, the LLM integrates the insights into a cohesive answer. This modular design enhances interpretability by making the reasoning process transparent and allows each agent to operate within its domain of expertise. Experiments on diverse multimodal QA benchmarks demonstrate that our cooperative, multi-agent framework consistently outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have large potential for molecular optimization, as they can gather external chemistry tools and enable collaborative interactions to iteratively refine molecular candidates. However, this potential remains underexplored, particularly in the context of structured reasoning, interpretability, and comprehensive tool-grounded molecular optimization. To address this gap, we introduce MT-Mol, a multi-agent framework for molecular optimization that leverages tool-guided reasoning and role-specialized LLM agents. Our system incorporates comprehensive RDKit tools, categorized into five distinct domains: structural descriptors, electronic and topological features, fragment-based functional groups, molecular representations, and miscellaneous chemical properties. Each category is managed by an expert analyst agent, responsible for extracting task-relevant tools and enabling interpretable, chemically grounded feedback. MT-Mol produces molecules with tool-aligned and stepwise reasoning through the interaction between the analyst agents, a molecule-generating scientist, a reasoning-output verifier, and a reviewer agent. As a result, we show that our framework shows the state-of-the-art performance of the PMO-1K benchmark on 17 out of 23 tasks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in healthcare, ensuring their safety, particularly within collaborative multi-agent configurations, is paramount. In this paper we introduce MedSentry, a benchmark comprising 5 000 adversarial medical prompts spanning 25 threat categories with 100 subthemes. Coupled with this dataset, we develop an end-to-end attack-defense evaluation pipeline to systematically analyze how four representative multi-agent topologies (Layers, SharedPool, Centralized, and Decentralized) withstand attacks from 'dark-personality' agents. Our findings reveal critical differences in how these architectures handle information contamination and maintain robust decision-making, exposing their underlying vulnerability mechanisms. For instance, SharedPool's open information sharing makes it highly susceptible, whereas Decentralized architectures exhibit greater resilience thanks to inherent redundancy and isolation. To mitigate these risks, we propose a personality-scale detection and correction mechanism that identifies and rehabilitates malicious agents, restoring system safety to near-baseline levels. MedSentry thus furnishes both a rigorous evaluation framework and practical defense strategies that guide the design of safer LLM-based multi-agent systems in medical domains.

Abstract: Modern navigation systems and shared mobility platforms increasingly rely on personalized route recommendations to improve individual travel experience and operational efficiency. However, a key question remains: can such sequential, personalized routing decisions collectively lead to system-optimal (SO) traffic assignment? This paper addresses this question by proposing a learning-based framework that reformulates the static SO traffic assignment problem as a single-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) task. A central agent sequentially recommends routes to travelers as origin-destination (OD) demands arrive, to minimize total system travel time. To enhance learning efficiency and solution quality, we develop an MSA-guided deep Q-learning algorithm that integrates the iterative structure of traditional traffic assignment methods into the RL training process. The proposed approach is evaluated on both the Braess and Ortuzar-Willumsen (OW) networks. Results show that the RL agent converges to the theoretical SO solution in the Braess network and achieves only a 0.35% deviation in the OW network. Further ablation studies demonstrate that the route action set's design significantly impacts convergence speed and final performance, with SO-informed route sets leading to faster learning and better outcomes. This work provides a theoretically grounded and practically relevant approach to bridging individual routing behavior with system-level efficiency through learning-based sequential assignment.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires the agent to navigate by following natural instructions under partial observability, making it difficult to align perception with language. Recent methods mitigate this by imagining future scenes, yet they rely on vision-based synthesis, leading to high computational cost and redundant details. To this end, we propose to adaptively imagine key environmental semantics via \textit{language} form, enabling a more reliable and efficient strategy. Specifically, we introduce a novel Adaptive Text Dreamer (ATD), a dual-branch self-guided imagination policy built upon a large language model (LLM). ATD is designed with a human-like left-right brain architecture, where the left brain focuses on logical integration, and the right brain is responsible for imaginative prediction of future scenes. To achieve this, we fine-tune only the Q-former within both brains to efficiently activate domain-specific knowledge in the LLM, enabling dynamic updates of logical reasoning and imagination during navigation. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject them into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the reasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model. We conduct extensive experiments on the R2R benchmark, where ATD achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. The code is \href{https://github.com/zhangpingrui/Adaptive-Text-Dreamer}{here}.

Abstract: World models have recently attracted growing interest in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) due to their ability to improve sample efficiency for policy learning. However, accurately modeling environments in MARL is challenging due to the exponentially large joint action space and highly uncertain dynamics inherent in multi-agent systems. To address this, we reduce modeling complexity by shifting from jointly modeling the entire state-action transition dynamics to focusing on the state space alone at each timestep through sequential agent modeling. Specifically, our approach enables the model to progressively resolve uncertainty while capturing the structured dependencies among agents, providing a more accurate representation of how agents influence the state. Interestingly, this sequential revelation of agents' actions in a multi-agent system aligns with the reverse process in diffusion models--a class of powerful generative models known for their expressiveness and training stability compared to autoregressive or latent variable models. Leveraging this insight, we develop a flexible and robust world model for MARL using diffusion models. Our method, Diffusion-Inspired Multi-Agent world model (DIMA), achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple multi-agent control benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior world models in terms of final return and sample efficiency, including MAMuJoCo and Bi-DexHands. DIMA establishes a new paradigm for constructing multi-agent world models, advancing the frontier of MARL research.

Abstract: The trajectories of 6G and AI are set for a creative collision. However, current visions for 6G remain largely incremental evolutions of 5G, while progress in AI is hampered by brittle, data-hungry models that lack robust reasoning capabilities. This paper argues for a foundational paradigm shift, moving beyond the purely technical level of communication toward systems capable of semantic understanding and effective, goal-oriented interaction. We propose a unified research vision rooted in the principles of System-2 cognition, built upon three pillars: Abstraction, enabling agents to learn meaningful world models from raw sensorimotor data; Compositionality, providing the algebraic tools to combine learned concepts and subsystems; and Emergent Communication, allowing intelligent agents to create their own adaptive and grounded languages. By integrating these principles, we lay the groundwork for truly intelligent systems that can reason, adapt, and collaborate, unifying advances in wireless communications, machine learning, and robotics under a single coherent framework.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various natural language tasks. However, their ability to accurately capture stakeholder requirements remains a significant challenge for using FMs for software development. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages an FM-powered multi-agent system called AlignMind to address this issue. By having a cognitive architecture that enhances FMs with Theory-of-Mind capabilities, our approach considers the mental states and perspectives of software makers. This allows our solution to iteratively clarify the beliefs, desires, and intentions of stakeholders, translating these into a set of refined requirements and a corresponding actionable natural language workflow in the often-overlooked requirements refinement phase of software engineering, which is crucial after initial elicitation. Through a multifaceted evaluation covering 150 diverse use cases, we demonstrate that our approach can accurately capture the intents and requirements of stakeholders, articulating them as both specifications and a step-by-step plan of action. Our findings suggest that the potential for significant improvements in the software development process justifies these investments. Our work lays the groundwork for future innovation in building intent-first development environments, where software makers can seamlessly collaborate with AIs to create software that truly meets their needs.

Abstract: Identifying super-spreaders can be framed as a subtask of the influence maximisation problem. It seeks to pinpoint agents within a network that, if selected as single diffusion seeds, disseminate information most effectively. Multilayer networks, a specific class of heterogeneous graphs, can capture diverse types of interactions (e.g., physical-virtual or professional-social), and thus offer a more accurate representation of complex relational structures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to identifying super-spreaders in such networks by leveraging graph neural networks. To this end, we construct a dataset by simulating information diffusion across hundreds of networks - to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind tailored specifically to multilayer networks. We further formulate the task as a variation of the ranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies each agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the duration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and (iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model, TopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom aggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data and adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our model against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning methods. The results, obtained across a broad spectrum of real-world and synthetic multilayer networks, demonstrate that TopSpreadersNetwork achieves superior performance in identifying high-impact nodes, while also offering improved interpretability through its structured output.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) collect and pseudo-label terabytes of multi-modal data localized to HD maps during normal fleet testing. However, identifying interesting and safety-critical scenarios from uncurated driving logs remains a significant challenge. Traditional scenario mining techniques are error-prone and prohibitively time-consuming, often relying on hand-crafted structured queries. In this work, we revisit spatio-temporal scenario mining through the lens of recent vision-language models (VLMs) to detect whether a described scenario occurs in a driving log and, if so, precisely localize it in both time and space. To address this problem, we introduce RefAV, a large-scale dataset of 10,000 diverse natural language queries that describe complex multi-agent interactions relevant to motion planning derived from 1000 driving logs in the Argoverse 2 Sensor dataset. We evaluate several referential multi-object trackers and present an empirical analysis of our baselines. Notably, we find that naively repurposing off-the-shelf VLMs yields poor performance, suggesting that scenario mining presents unique challenges. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/CainanD/RefAV/ and https://argoverse.github.io/user-guide/tasks/scenario_mining.html

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown impressive reasoning capabilities in interactive decision-making tasks. These agents interact with environment through intermediate interfaces, such as predefined action spaces and interaction rules, which mediate the perception and action. However, mismatches often happen between the internal expectations of the agent regarding the influence of its issued actions and the actual state transitions in the environment, a phenomenon referred to as \textbf{agent-environment misalignment}. While prior work has invested substantially in improving agent strategies and environment design, the critical role of the interface still remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that agent-environment misalignment poses a significant bottleneck to agent performance. To mitigate this issue, we propose \textbf{ALIGN}, an \underline{A}uto-A\underline{l}igned \underline{I}nterface \underline{G}e\underline{n}eration framework that alleviates the misalignment by enriching the interface. Specifically, the ALIGN-generated interface enhances both the static information of the environment and the step-wise observations returned to the agent. Implemented as a lightweight wrapper, this interface achieves the alignment without modifying either the agent logic or the environment code. Experiments across multiple domains including embodied tasks, web navigation and tool-use, show consistent performance improvements, with up to a 45.67\% success rate improvement observed in ALFWorld. Meanwhile, ALIGN-generated interface can generalize across different agent architectures and LLM backbones without interface regeneration. Code and experimental results are available at https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/ALIGN.

Abstract: Project building is pivotal to support various program analysis tasks, such as generating intermediate rep- resentation code for static analysis and preparing binary code for vulnerability reproduction. However, automating the building process for C/C++ projects is a highly complex endeavor, involving tremendous technical challenges, such as intricate dependency management, diverse build systems, varied toolchains, and multifaceted error handling mechanisms. Consequently, building C/C++ projects often proves to be difficult in practice, hindering the progress of downstream applications. Unfortunately, research on facilitating the building of C/C++ projects remains to be inadequate. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers promising solutions to automated software building. Trained on extensive corpora, LLMs can help unify diverse build systems through their comprehension capabilities and address complex errors by leveraging tacit knowledge storage. Moreover, LLM-based agents can be systematically designed to dynamically interact with the environment, effectively managing dynamic building issues. Motivated by these opportunities, we first conduct an empirical study to systematically analyze the current challenges in the C/C++ project building process. Particularly, we observe that most popular C/C++ projects encounter an average of five errors when relying solely on the default build systems. Based on our study, we develop an automated build system called CXXCrafter to specifically address the above-mentioned challenges, such as dependency resolution. Our evaluation on open-source software demonstrates that CXXCrafter achieves a success rate of 78% in project building. Specifically, among the Top100 dataset, 72 projects are built successfully by both CXXCrafter and manual efforts, 3 by CXXCrafter only, and 14 manually only. ...

Abstract: This paper introduces ADEPT, a system using Large Language Model (LLM) personas to simulate multi-perspective ethical debates. ADEPT assembles panels of 'AI personas', each embodying a distinct ethical framework or stakeholder perspective (like a deontologist, consequentialist, or disability rights advocate), to deliberate on complex moral issues. Its application is demonstrated through a scenario about prioritizing patients for a limited number of ventilators inspired by real-world challenges in allocating scarce medical resources. Two debates, each with six LLM personas, were conducted; they only differed in the moral viewpoints represented: one included a Catholic bioethicist and a care theorist, the other substituted a rule-based Kantian philosopher and a legal adviser. Both panels ultimately favoured the same policy -- a lottery system weighted for clinical need and fairness, crucially avoiding the withdrawal of ventilators for reallocation. However, each panel reached that conclusion through different lines of argument, and their voting coalitions shifted once duty- and rights-based voices were present. Examination of the debate transcripts shows that the altered membership redirected attention toward moral injury, legal risk and public trust, which in turn changed four continuing personas' final positions. The work offers three contributions: (i) a transparent, replicable workflow for running and analysing multi-agent AI debates in bioethics; (ii) evidence that the moral perspectives included in such panels can materially change the outcome even when the factual inputs remain constant; and (iii) an analysis of the implications and future directions for such AI-mediated approaches to ethical deliberation and policy.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems (MAS) are transforming how humans and AIs collaboratively generate ideas and artifacts. While existing surveys provide comprehensive overviews of MAS infrastructures, they largely overlook the dimension of \emph{creativity}, including how novel outputs are generated and evaluated, how creativity informs agent personas, and how creative workflows are coordinated. This is the first survey dedicated to creativity in MAS. We focus on text and image generation tasks, and present: (1) a taxonomy of agent proactivity and persona design; (2) an overview of generation techniques, including divergent exploration, iterative refinement, and collaborative synthesis, as well as relevant datasets and evaluation metrics; and (3) a discussion of key challenges, such as inconsistent evaluation standards, insufficient bias mitigation, coordination conflicts, and the lack of unified benchmarks. This survey offers a structured framework and roadmap for advancing the development, evaluation, and standardization of creative MAS.

<title>IKMo: Image-Keyframed Motion Generation with Trajectory-Pose Conditioned Motion Diffusion Model</title>

Abstract: Existing human motion generation methods with trajectory and pose inputs operate global processing on both modalities, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this paper, we propose IKMo, an image-keyframed motion generation method based on the diffusion model with trajectory and pose being decoupled. The trajectory and pose inputs go through a two-stage conditioning framework. In the first stage, the dedicated optimization module is applied to refine inputs. In the second stage, trajectory and pose are encoded via a Trajectory Encoder and a Pose Encoder in parallel. Then, motion with high spatial and semantic fidelity is guided by a motion ControlNet, which processes the fused trajectory and pose data. Experiment results based on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on all metrics under trajectory-keyframe constraints. In addition, MLLM-based agents are implemented to pre-process model inputs. Given texts and keyframe images from users, the agents extract motion descriptions, keyframe poses, and trajectories as the optimized inputs into the motion generation model. We conducts a user study with 10 participants. The experiment results prove that the MLLM-based agents pre-processing makes generated motion more in line with users' expectation. We believe that the proposed method improves both the fidelity and controllability of motion generation by the diffusion model.

Abstract: Current personalized recommender systems predominantly rely on static offline data for algorithm design and evaluation, significantly limiting their ability to capture long-term user preference evolution and social influence dynamics in real-world scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a high-fidelity social simulation platform integrating human-like cognitive agents and dynamic social interactions to realistically simulate user behavior evolution under recommendation interventions. Specifically, the system comprises a population of Sim-User Agents, each equipped with a five-layer cognitive architecture that encapsulates key psychological mechanisms, including episodic memory, affective state transitions, adaptive preference learning, and dynamic trust-risk assessments. In particular, we innovatively introduce the Intimacy--Curiosity--Reciprocity--Risk (ICR2) motivational engine grounded in psychological and sociological theories, enabling more realistic user decision-making processes. Furthermore, we construct a multilayer heterogeneous social graph (GGBond Graph) supporting dynamic relational evolution, effectively modeling users' evolving social ties and trust dynamics based on interest similarity, personality alignment, and structural homophily. During system operation, agents autonomously respond to recommendations generated by typical recommender algorithms (e.g., Matrix Factorization, MultVAE, LightGCN), deciding whether to consume, rate, and share content while dynamically updating their internal states and social connections, thereby forming a stable, multi-round feedback loop. This innovative design transcends the limitations of traditional static datasets, providing a controlled, observable environment for evaluating long-term recommender effects.

<title>Breaking the Performance Ceiling in Complex Reinforcement Learning requires Inference Strategies</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) systems have countless applications, from energy-grid management to protein design. However, such real-world scenarios are often extremely difficult, combinatorial in nature, and require complex coordination between multiple agents. This level of complexity can cause even state-of-the-art RL systems, trained until convergence, to hit a performance ceiling which they are unable to break out of with zero-shot inference. Meanwhile, many digital or simulation-based applications allow for an inference phase that utilises a specific time and compute budget to explore multiple attempts before outputting a final solution. In this work, we show that such an inference phase employed at execution time, and the choice of a corresponding inference strategy, are key to breaking the performance ceiling observed in complex multi-agent RL problems. Our main result is striking: we can obtain up to a 126% and, on average, a 45% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art across 17 tasks, using only a couple seconds of extra wall-clock time during execution. We also demonstrate promising compute scaling properties, supported by over 60k experiments, making it the largest study on inference strategies for complex RL to date.

<title>Data-Driven Cellular Mobility Management via Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Mobility management in cellular networks faces increasing complexity due to network densification and heterogeneous user mobility characteristics. Traditional handover (HO) mechanisms, which rely on predefined parameters such as A3-offset and time-to-trigger (TTT), often fail to optimize mobility performance across varying speeds and deployment conditions. Fixed A3-offset and TTT configurations either delay HOs, increasing radio link failures (RLFs), or accelerate them, leading to excessive ping-pong effects. To address these challenges, we propose two data-driven mobility management approaches leveraging high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HD-BO) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). HD-BO optimizes HO parameters such as A3-offset and TTT, striking a desired trade-off between ping-pongs vs. RLF. DRL provides a non-parameter-based approach, allowing an agent to select serving cells based on real-time network conditions. We validate our approach using a real-world cellular deployment scenario, and employing Sionna ray tracing for site-specific channel propagation modeling. Results show that both HD-BO and DRL outperform 3GPP set-1 (TTT of 480 ms and A3-offset of 3 dB) and set-5 (TTT of 40 ms and A3-offset of -1 dB) benchmarks. We augment HD-BO with transfer learning so it can generalize across a range of user speeds. Applying the same transfer-learning strategy to the DRL method reduces its training time by a factor of 2.5 while preserving optimal HO performance, showing that it adapts efficiently to the mobility of aerial users such as UAVs. Simulations further reveal that HD-BO remains more sample-efficient than DRL, making it more suitable for scenarios with limited training data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have spurred increased interest in Device-Control Agents (DC agents), such as utilizing in-the-wild device control to manage graphical user interfaces. Conventional methods for assessing the capabilities of DC agents, such as computing step-wise action accuracy and overall task success rates, provide a macroscopic view of DC agents' performance; however, they fail to offer microscopic insights into potential errors that may occur in real-world applications. Conducting a finer-grained performance evaluation of DC agents presents significant challenges. This study introduces a new perspective on evaluation methods for DC agents by proposing the XBOUND evaluation method, which employs the calculation of a novel Explore Metric to delineate the capability boundaries of DC agents. Compared to previous evaluation methods, XBOUND focuses on individual states to assess the proficiency of DC agents in mastering these states. Furthermore, we have developed a ``pseudo'' episode tree dataset derived from Android Control test data. Utilizing this dataset and XBOUND, we comprehensively evaluate the OS-Atlas and UI-TARS series, examining both the overall and specific performance across five common tasks. Additionally, we select representative cases to highlight the current deficiencies and limitations inherent in both series. Code is available at https://github.com/sqzhang-lazy/XBOUND.

<title>PACT: A Contract-Theoretic Framework for Pricing Agentic AI Services Powered by Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Agentic AI, often powered by large language models (LLMs), is becoming increasingly popular and adopted to support autonomous reasoning, decision-making, and task execution across various domains. While agentic AI holds great promise, its deployment as services for easy access raises critical challenges in pricing, due to high infrastructure and computation costs, multi-dimensional and task-dependent Quality of Service (QoS), and growing concerns around liability in high-stakes applications. In this work, we propose PACT, a Pricing framework for cloud-based Agentic AI services through a Contract-Theoretic approach, which models QoS along both objective (e.g., response time) and subjective (e.g., user satisfaction) dimensions. PACT accounts for computational, infrastructure, and potential liability costs for the service provider, while ensuring incentive compatibility and individual rationality for the user under information asymmetry. Through contract-based selection, users receive tailored service offerings aligned with their needs. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that PACT improves QoS alignment between users and providers and offers a scalable, liable approach to pricing agentic AI services in the future.

<title>Complex System Diagnostics Using a Knowledge Graph-Informed and Large Language Model-Enhanced Framework</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21291</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diagnostic framework that integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support system diagnostics in high-reliability systems such as nuclear power plants. Traditional diagnostic modeling struggles when systems become too complex, making functional modeling a more attractive approach. Our approach introduces a diagnostic framework grounded in the functional modeling principles of the Dynamic Master Logic (DML) model. It incorporates two coordinated LLM components, including an LLM-based workflow for automated construction of DML logic from system documentation and an LLM agent that facilitates interactive diagnostics. The generated logic is encoded into a structured KG, referred to as KG-DML, which supports hierarchical fault reasoning. Expert knowledge or operational data can also be incorporated to refine the model's precision and diagnostic depth. In the interaction phase, users submit natural language queries, which are interpreted by the LLM agent. The agent selects appropriate tools for structured reasoning, including upward and downward propagation across the KG-DML. Rather than embedding KG content into every prompt, the LLM agent distinguishes between diagnostic and interpretive tasks. For diagnostics, the agent selects and executes external tools that perform structured KG reasoning. For general queries, a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) approach is used, retrieving relevant KG segments and embedding them into the prompt to generate natural explanations. A case study on an auxiliary feedwater system demonstrated the framework's effectiveness, with over 90% accuracy in key elements and consistent tool and argument extraction, supporting its use in safety-critical diagnostics.

<title>Large Language Models Miss the Multi-Agent Mark</title>

Abstract: Recent interest in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models (MAS LLMs) has led to an increase in frameworks leveraging multiple LLMs to tackle complex tasks. However, much of this literature appropriates the terminology of MAS without engaging with its foundational principles. In this position paper, we highlight critical discrepancies between MAS theory and current MAS LLMs implementations, focusing on four key areas: the social aspect of agency, environment design, coordination and communication protocols, and measuring emergent behaviours. Our position is that many MAS LLMs lack multi-agent characteristics such as autonomy, social interaction, and structured environments, and often rely on oversimplified, LLM-centric architectures. The field may slow down and lose traction by revisiting problems the MAS literature has already addressed. Therefore, we systematically analyse this issue and outline associated research opportunities; we advocate for better integrating established MAS concepts and more precise terminology to avoid mischaracterisation and missed opportunities.

<title>PEDANTIC: A Dataset for the Automatic Examination of Definiteness in Patent Claims</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21342</link>

Abstract: Patent claims define the scope of protection for an invention. If there are ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office. In the US, this is referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C {\S} 112(b)) and is among the most frequent reasons for patent application rejection. The development of automatic methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent drafting and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been published to date. We introduce PEDANTIC (Patent Definiteness Examination Corpus), a novel dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent applications relating to Natural Language Processing (NLP), annotated with reasons for indefiniteness. We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness. A human validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality annotations. To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every model-cited reason with every examiner-cited reason. We show that LLM agents based on Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression baselines on definiteness prediction, even though they often correctly identify the underlying reasons. PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI researchers, enabling the development of advanced examination models. We will publicly release the dataset and code.

<title>Evaluating LLM Adaptation to Sociodemographic Factors: User Profile vs. Dialogue History</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21362</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Effective engagement by large language models (LLMs) requires adapting responses to users' sociodemographic characteristics, such as age, occupation, and education level. While many real-world applications leverage dialogue history for contextualization, existing evaluations of LLMs' behavioral adaptation often focus on single-turn prompts. In this paper, we propose a framework to evaluate LLM adaptation when attributes are introduced either (1) explicitly via user profiles in the prompt or (2) implicitly through multi-turn dialogue history. We assess the consistency of model behavior across these modalities. Using a multi-agent pipeline, we construct a synthetic dataset pairing dialogue histories with distinct user profiles and employ questions from the Value Survey Module (VSM 2013) (Hofstede and Hofstede, 2016) to probe value expression. Our findings indicate that most models adjust their expressed values in response to demographic changes, particularly in age and education level, but consistency varies. Models with stronger reasoning capabilities demonstrate greater alignment, indicating the importance of reasoning in robust sociodemographic adaptation.
