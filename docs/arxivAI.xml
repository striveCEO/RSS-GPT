Abstract: Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic understanding, exposing a key gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable epistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI research asking "what is intelligence?" (ontological), SCL asks "under what conditions does cognition emerge?" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of mind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and extended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a performed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action, and regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling "executable epistemology" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it shows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems, supported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic state through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of mind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not as truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a phenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real progress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive principles structurally.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in the biosciences is transforming biotechnology, medicine, and synthetic biology. Yet this advancement is intrinsically linked to new vulnerabilities, as GenAI lowers the barrier to misuse and introduces novel biosecurity threats, such as generating synthetic viral proteins or toxins. These dual-use risks are often overlooked, as existing safety guardrails remain fragile and can be circumvented through deceptive prompts or jailbreak techniques. In this Perspective, we first outline the current state of GenAI in the biosciences and emerging threat vectors ranging from jailbreak attacks and privacy risks to the dual-use challenges posed by autonomous AI agents. We then examine urgent gaps in regulation and oversight, drawing on insights from 130 expert interviews across academia, government, industry, and policy. A large majority ($\approx 76$\%) expressed concern over AI misuse in biology, and 74\% called for the development of new governance frameworks. Finally, we explore technical pathways to mitigation, advocating a multi-layered approach to GenAI safety. These defenses include rigorous data filtering, alignment with ethical principles during development, and real-time monitoring to block harmful requests. Together, these strategies provide a blueprint for embedding security throughout the GenAI lifecycle. As GenAI becomes integrated into the biosciences, safeguarding this frontier requires an immediate commitment to both adaptive governance and secure-by-design technologies.

<title>CudaForge: An Agent Framework with Hardware Feedback for CUDA Kernel Optimization</title>

Abstract: Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI applications such as large-scale LLM training. However, manual kernel design is both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation, however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3, achieves 97.6\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$ speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed, CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090, 3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4, QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \$ 0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that costs 6 H100 hours and \$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable, and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization.

<title>EvoMem: Improving Multi-Agent Planning with Dual-Evolving Memory</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01912</link>

Abstract: Planning has been a cornerstone of artificial intelligence for solving complex problems, and recent progress in LLM-based multi-agent frameworks have begun to extend this capability. However, the role of human-like memory within these frameworks remains largely unexplored. Understanding how agents coordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where iterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the success. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present EvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The framework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor) and two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries by storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a query, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by accumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory modules are reset at the end of each query session. Evaluations on trip planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of EvoMem. This success underscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning.

<title>Vortex: Hosting ML Inference and Knowledge Retrieval Services With Tight Latency and Throughput Requirements</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02062</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.02062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing interest in deploying ML inference and knowledge retrieval as services that could support both interactive queries by end users and more demanding request flows that arise from AIs integrated into a end-user applications and deployed as agents. Our central premise is that these latter cases will bring service level latency objectives (SLOs). Existing ML serving platforms use batching to optimize for high throughput, exposing them to unpredictable tail latencies. Vortex enables an SLO-first approach. For identical tasks, Vortex's pipelines achieve significantly lower and more stable latencies than TorchServe and Ray Serve over a wide range of workloads, often enabling a given SLO target at more than twice the request rate. When RDMA is available, the Vortex advantage is even more significant.

<title>Human-AI Co-Embodied Intelligence for Scientific Experimentation and Manufacturing</title>

Abstract: Scientific experiment and manufacture rely on complex, multi-step procedures that demand continuous human expertise for precise execution and decision-making. Despite advances in machine learning and automation, conventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world experiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This gap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility, scalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows. Here, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI that unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated system for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm, humans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes memory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The wearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture processes, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for corrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we present Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic reasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and interprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures, provides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a cleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large language models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to beginners. These results establish a new class of agentic-physical-human intelligence that extends agentic reasoning beyond computation into the physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.

Abstract: When designing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, a designer communicates the desired agent behavior through the definition of reward functions - numerical feedback given to the agent as reward or punishment for its actions. However, mapping desired behaviors to reward functions can be a difficult process, especially in complex environments such as autonomous racing. In this paper, we demonstrate how current foundation models can effectively search over a space of reward functions to produce desirable RL agents for the Gran Turismo 7 racing game, given only text-based instructions. Through a combination of LLM-based reward generation, VLM preference-based evaluation, and human feedback we demonstrate how our system can be used to produce racing agents competitive with GT Sophy, a champion-level RL racing agent, as well as generate novel behaviors, paving the way for practical automated reward design in real world applications.

<title>A Step Toward World Models: A Survey on Robotic Manipulation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02097</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Autonomous agents are increasingly expected to operate in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments, performing tasks such as manipulation, navigation, and decision-making. Achieving these capabilities requires agents to understand the underlying mechanisms and dynamics of the world, moving beyond purely reactive control or simple replication of observed states. This motivates the development of world models as internal representations that encode environmental states, capture dynamics, and enable prediction, planning, and reasoning. Despite growing interest, the definition, scope, architectures, and essential capabilities of world models remain ambiguous. In this survey, rather than directly imposing a fixed definition and limiting our scope to methods explicitly labeled as world models, we examine approaches that exhibit the core capabilities of world models through a review of methods in robotic manipulation. We analyze their roles across perception, prediction, and control, identify key challenges and solutions, and distill the core components, capabilities, and functions that a real world model should possess. Building on this analysis, we aim to outline a roadmap for developing generalizable and practical world models for robotics.

<title>InsurAgent: A Large Language Model-Empowered Agent for Simulating Individual Behavior in Purchasing Flood Insurance</title>

Abstract: Flood insurance is an effective strategy for individuals to mitigate disaster-related losses. However, participation rates among at-risk populations in the United States remain strikingly low. This gap underscores the need to understand and model the behavioral mechanisms underlying insurance decisions. Large language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited human-like intelligence across wide-ranging tasks, offering promising tools for simulating human decision-making. This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance purchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs is evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they fall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this limitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules including perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed. The retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground decisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal and bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to extrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is intractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation of temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life trajectory. Overall, InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral modeling and policy analysis.

<title>Online Distributed Zeroth-Order Optimization With Non-Zero-Mean Adverse Noises</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.02183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of online distributed zeroth-order optimization subject to a set constraint is studied via a multi-agent network, where each agent can communicate with its immediate neighbors via a time-varying directed graph. Different from the existing works on online distributed zeroth- order optimization, we consider the case where the estimate on the gradients are influenced by some non-zero-mean adverse noises. To handle this problem, we propose a new online dis- tributed zeroth-order mirror descent algorithm involving a kernel function-based estimator and a clipped strategy. Particularly, in the estimator, the kernel function-based strategy is provided to deal with the adverse noises, and eliminate the low-order terms in the Taylor expansions of the objective functions. Furthermore, the performance of the presented algorithm is measured by employing the dynamic regrets, where the offline benchmarks are to find the optimal point at each time. Under the mild assumptions on the graph and the objective functions, we prove that if the variation in the optimal point sequence grows at a certain rate, then the high probability bound of the dynamic regrets increases sublinearly. Finally, a simulation experiment is worked out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

<title>A Quantitative Comparison of Centralised and Distributed Reinforcement Learning-Based Control for Soft Robotic Arms</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02192</link>

arXiv:2511.02192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative comparison between centralised and distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) architectures for controlling a soft robotic arm modelled as a Cosserat rod in simulation. Using PyElastica and the OpenAI Gym interface, we train both a global Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) controller and a Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO) under identical budgets. Both approaches are based on the arm having $n$ number of controlled sections. The study systematically varies $n$ and evaluates the performance of the arm to reach a fixed target in three scenarios: default baseline condition, recovery from external disturbance, and adaptation to actuator failure. Quantitative metrics used for the evaluation are mean action magnitude, mean final distance, mean episode length, and success rate. The results show that there are no significant benefits of the distributed policy when the number of controlled sections $n\le4$. In very simple systems, when $n\le2$, the centralised policy outperforms the distributed one. When $n$ increases to $4< n\le 12$, the distributed policy shows a high sample efficiency. In these systems, distributed policy promotes a stronger success rate, resilience, and robustness under local observability and yields faster convergence given the same sample size. However, centralised policies achieve much higher time efficiency during training as it takes much less time to train the same size of samples. These findings highlight the trade-offs between centralised and distributed policy in reinforcement learning-based control for soft robotic systems and provide actionable design guidance for future sim-to-real transfer in soft rod-like manipulators.

<title>Optimal-Agent-Selection: State-Aware Routing Framework for Efficient Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>

Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) has unlocked new frontiers in complex task-solving, enabling diverse agents to integrate unique expertise, collaborate flexibly, and address challenges unattainable for individual models. However, the full potential of such systems is hindered by rigid agent scheduling and inefficient coordination strategies that fail to adapt to evolving task requirements. In this paper, we propose STRMAC, a state-aware routing framework designed for efficient collaboration in multi-agent systems. Our method separately encodes interaction history and agent knowledge to power the router, which adaptively selects the most suitable single agent at each step for efficient and effective collaboration. Furthermore, we introduce a self-evolving data generation approach that accelerates the collection of high-quality execution paths for efficient system training. Experiments on challenging collaborative reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 23.8% improvement over baselines and reducing data collection overhead by up to 90.1% compared to exhaustive search.

Abstract: While existing work focuses primarily on task success, we argue that effective real-world agents require optimizing three dimensions: productivity (task completion), proactivity (asking essential questions), and personalization (adapting to diverse user preferences). We introduce UserVille, an interactive environment with LLM-based user simulators enabling diverse, configurable user preferences. Leveraging UserVille, we introduce PPP, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes all three dimensions: Productivity, Proactivity, and Personalization. Experiments on software engineering and deep research tasks show that agents trained with PPP achieve substantial improvements over strong baselines such as GPT-5 (+21.6 on average), demonstrating the ability to ask strategic clarifying questions, adapt to unseen user preferences, and improve task success through better interaction. This work demonstrates that explicitly optimizing for user-centered interaction is critical for building practical and effective AI agents.

Abstract: Next-generation wireless communication systems must support ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) service for mission-critical applications. Meeting stringent URLLC requirements is challenging, especially for two-hop cooperative communication. In this paper, we develop an adaptive transmission design for a two-hop relaying communication system. Each hop transmission adaptively configures its transmission parameters separately, including numerology, mini-slot size, and modulation and coding scheme, for reliable packet transmission within a strict latency constraint. We formulate the hop-specific transceiver configuration as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a dual-agent reinforcement learning-based cooperative latency-aware transmission (DRL-CoLA) algorithm to learn latency-aware transmission policies in a distributed manner. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm achieves the near-optimal reliability while satisfying strict latency requirements.

<title>Continuum: Efficient and Robust Multi-Turn LLM Agent Scheduling with KV Cache Time-to-Live</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.02230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic LLM applications interleave LLM generation requests with tool calls. These tool calls break the continuity of the workflow by creating pauses between LLM requests, bringing many challenges for the serving system, especially under multi-turn scenarios. Each pause potentially causes KV cache eviction and extra waiting time before entering the continuous batch for the following LLM request. Since these pauses happen for each call, this problem becomes increasingly severe as turn number grow for agentic programs. Previous works either fail to incorporate information from the tool call, evicting KV cache that leads to repetitive prefill or loading, or ignore the continuity of a multi-turn program, creating waiting time between turns that increases per-request latency.
  We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for multi-turn agent workloads by combining tool-aware KV cache timeout with program-level scheduling. By predicting tool call durations in agentic workflows, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a time-to-live value based on total turn number. When combined with program-level first-come-first-serve, Continuum prevents scheduling bubbles, preserves multi-turn continuity, and optimizes for throughput for complex agentic workflows. By modeling the variability of tool call and agent program continuity, Continuum outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation on real-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B models shows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times, and remains performant across different hardware setups and DRAM offloading schemes.

<title>LACY: A Vision-Language Model-based Language-Action Cycle for Self-Improving Robotic Manipulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.02239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning generalizable policies for robotic manipulation increasingly relies on large-scale models that map language instructions to actions (L2A). However, this one-way paradigm often produces policies that execute tasks without deeper contextual understanding, limiting their ability to generalize or explain their behavior. We argue that the complementary skill of mapping actions back to language (A2L) is essential for developing more holistic grounding. An agent capable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal representations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We introduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such bidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly trained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from language (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying semantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a self-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data through an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby improving the model without additional human labels. Experiments on pick-and-place tasks in both simulation and the real world show that LACY improves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust language-action grounding for robotic manipulation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.02241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible learning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that hallucinations, omissions, and biases are prevalent in everyday use-cases of LLMs. However, chatbots used in medical contexts must provide consistent advice in situations where non-medical factors are involved, such as when demographic information is present. In order to understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code and dataset are available here: https://github.com/BBN-E/medic-neurips-2025-demo.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning and verifiable rewards have achieved strong results on complex reasoning tasks. Recent work extends this paradigm to a multi-agent setting, where a meta-thinking agent proposes plans and monitors progress while a reasoning agent executes subtasks through sequential conversational turns. Despite promising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior, in which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining collaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior naturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and efficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue. Finally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost in multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter this, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by allowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate instructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and unlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning multi-task, multi-agent policies for cooperative, temporal objectives, under centralized training, decentralized execution. In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the decomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to agents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited to the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for learning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main challenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove the correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of learned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time. Experiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents, e.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and short-circuiting tasks.

<title>Large-scale automatic carbon ion treatment planning for head and neck cancers via parallel multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>

Abstract: Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) planning is difficult because multiple critical organs-at-risk (OARs) are close to complex targets. Intensity-modulated carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but remains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading to laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many treatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are limited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We propose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45 TPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE) QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for stable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance efficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2) apply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to uniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed piecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker system interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and accelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10 testing), the method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans comparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score: RL $85.93\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\pm6.92%$), with significant (p-value $<$ 0.05) improvements for five OARs. The framework efficiently explores high-dimensional TPP spaces and generates clinically competitive IMCT plans through direct TPS interaction, notably improving OAR sparing.

Abstract: AI coding agents have shown great progress on Python software engineering benchmarks like SWE-Bench, and for other languages like Java and C in benchmarks like Multi-SWE-Bench. However, C# -- a prominent enterprise language ranking #5 in the TIOBE index -- remains absent from such benchmarks. We introduce SWE-Sharp-Bench, a reproducible software engineering benchmark for C\# featuring 150 instances from 17 repositories. Evaluating identical model-agent configurations across languages reveals a significant performance gap: while 70% of Python tasks in SWE-Bench Verified are solved, $only 40% of our C\# tasks are resolved. We open-source SWE-Sharp-Bench and our entire curation pipeline.

<title>LUMA-RAG: Lifelong Multimodal Agents with Provably Stable Streaming Alignment</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for grounding large language model outputs in verifiable evidence. However, as modern AI agents transition from static knowledge bases to continuous multimodal streams encompassing text, images, video, and audio, two critical challenges arise: maintaining index freshness without prohibitive re-indexing costs, and preserving cross-modal semantic consistency across heterogeneous embedding spaces. We present LUMA-RAG, a lifelong multimodal agent architecture featuring three key innovations: (i) a streaming, multi-tier memory system that dynamically spills embeddings from a hot HNSW tier to a compressed IVFPQ tier under strict memory budgets; (ii) a streaming CLAP->CLIP alignment bridge that maintains cross-modal consistency through incremental orthogonal Procrustes updates; and (iii) stability-aware retrieval telemetry providing Safe@k guarantees by jointly bounding alignment drift and quantization error. Experiments demonstrate robust text-to-image retrieval (Recall@10 = 0.94), graceful performance degradation under product quantization offloading, and provably stable audio-to-image rankings (Safe@1 = 1.0), establishing LUMA-RAG as a practical framework for production multimodal RAG systems.

<title>Revisiting put-that-there, context aware window interactions via LLMs</title>

Abstract: We revisit Bolt's classic "Put-That-There" concept for modern head-mounted displays by pairing Large Language Models (LLMs) with XR sensor and tech stack. The agent fuses (i) a semantically segmented 3-D environment, (ii) live application metadata, and (iii) users' verbal, pointing, and head-gaze cues to issue JSON window-placement actions. As a result, users can manage a panoramic workspace through: (1) explicit commands ("Place Google Maps on the coffee table"), (2) deictic speech plus gestures ("Put that there"), or (3) high-level goals ("I need to send a message"). Unlike traditional explicit interfaces, our system supports one-to-many action mappings and goal-centric reasoning, allowing the LLM to dynamically infer relevant applications and layout decisions, including interrelationships across tools. This enables seamless, intent-driven interaction without manual window juggling in immersive XR environments.

<title>A Spatially Informed Gaussian Process UCB Method for Decentralized Coverage Control</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02398</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.02398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel decentralized algorithm for coverage control in unknown spatial environments modeled by Gaussian Processes (GPs). To trade-off between exploration and exploitation, each agent autonomously determines its trajectory by minimizing a local cost function. Inspired by the GP-UCB (Upper Confidence Bound for GPs) acquisition function, the proposed cost combines the expected locational cost with a variance-based exploration term, guiding agents toward regions that are both high in predicted density and model uncertainty. Compared to previous work, our algorithm operates in a fully decentralized fashion, relying only on local observations and communication with neighboring agents. In particular, agents periodically update their inducing points using a greedy selection strategy, enabling scalable online GP updates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in simulation.

<title>EvoDev: An Iterative Feature-Driven Framework for End-to-End Software Development with LLM-based Agents</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model agents offer the promise of automating end-to-end software development from natural language requirements. However, existing approaches largely adopt linear, waterfall-style pipelines, which oversimplify the iterative nature of real-world development and struggle with complex, large-scale projects. To address these limitations, we propose EvoDev, an iterative software development framework inspired by feature-driven development. EvoDev decomposes user requirements into a set of user-valued features and constructs a Feature Map, a directed acyclic graph that explicitly models dependencies between features. Each node in the feature map maintains multi-level information, including business logic, design, and code, which is propagated along dependencies to provide context for subsequent development iterations. We evaluate EvoDev on challenging Android development tasks and show that it outperforms the best-performing baseline, Claude Code, by a substantial margin of 56.8%, while improving single-agent performance by 16.0%-76.6% across different base LLMs, highlighting the importance of dependency modeling, context propagation, and workflow-aware agent design for complex software projects. Our work summarizes practical insights for designing iterative, LLM-driven development frameworks and informs future training of base LLMs to better support iterative software development.

<title>ReAcTree: Hierarchical LLM Agent Trees with Control Flow for Long-Horizon Task Planning</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled significant progress in decision-making and task planning for embodied autonomous agents. However, most existing methods still struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks because they rely on a monolithic trajectory that entangles all past decisions and observations, attempting to solve the entire task in a single unified process. To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical task-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the tree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent nodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent node retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and shares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on the WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently outperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs. Notably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5 72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.

Abstract: Video Understanding, Scene Interpretation and Commonsense Reasoning are highly challenging tasks enabling the interpretation of visual information, allowing agents to perceive, interact with and make rational decisions in its environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks, combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity poses challenges for their application on edge devices and in the context of Mobile Robotics, especially considering the trade-off between accuracy and inference time. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of state-of-the-art VLMs for the task of Scene Interpretation and Action Recognition, with special regard to small VLMs capable of being deployed to edge devices in the context of Mobile Robotics. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on a diverse dataset consisting of various real-world cityscape, on-campus and indoor scenarios. The experimental evaluation discusses the potential of these small models on edge devices, with particular emphasis on challenges, weaknesses, inherent model biases and the application of the gained information.

<title>Adapting General-Purpose Foundation Models for X-ray Ptychography in Low-Data Regimes</title>

Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of 0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for developing more effective science-based agentic systems.

Abstract: Endowing robot hands with human-level dexterity has been a long-standing goal in robotics. Bimanual robotic piano playing represents a particularly challenging task: it is high-dimensional, contact-rich, and requires fast, precise control. We present OmniPianist, the first agent capable of performing nearly one thousand music pieces via scalable, human-demonstration-free learning. Our approach is built on three core components. First, we introduce an automatic fingering strategy based on Optimal Transport (OT), allowing the agent to autonomously discover efficient piano-playing strategies from scratch without demonstrations. Second, we conduct large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) by training more than 2,000 agents, each specialized in distinct music pieces, and aggregate their experience into a dataset named RP1M++, consisting of over one million trajectories for robotic piano playing. Finally, we employ a Flow Matching Transformer to leverage RP1M++ through large-scale imitation learning, resulting in the OmniPianist agent capable of performing a wide range of musical pieces. Extensive experiments and ablation studies highlight the effectiveness and scalability of our approach, advancing dexterous robotic piano playing at scale.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a new paradigm for automating complex systems by using Large AI Models (LAMs) to provide human-level cognitive abilities with multimodal perception, planning, memory, and reasoning capabilities. This will lead to a new generation of AI systems that autonomously decompose goals, retain context over time, learn continuously, operate across tools and environments, and adapt dynamically. The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G networks renders manual optimization ineffective, pointing to Agentic AI as a method for automating decisions in dynamic RAN environments. However, despite its rapid advances, there is no established framework outlining the foundational components and operational principles of Agentic AI systems nor a universally accepted definition.
  This paper contributes to ongoing research on Agentic AI in 5G and 6G networks by outlining its core concepts and then proposing a practical use case that applies Agentic principles to RAN optimization. We first introduce Agentic AI, tracing its evolution from classical agents and discussing the progress from workflows and simple AI agents to Agentic AI. Core design patterns-reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration-are then described to illustrate how intelligent behaviors are orchestrated. These theorical concepts are grounded in the context of mobile networks, with a focus on RAN management and optimization. A practical 5G RAN case study shows how time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents collaborate for KPI-based autonomous decision-making.

Abstract: We introduce SigmaCollab, a dataset enabling research on physically situated human-AI collaboration. The dataset consists of a set of 85 sessions in which untrained participants were guided by a mixed-reality assistive AI agent in performing procedural tasks in the physical world. SigmaCollab includes a set of rich, multimodal data streams, such as the participant and system audio, egocentric camera views from the head-mounted device, depth maps, head, hand and gaze tracking information, as well as additional annotations performed post-hoc. While the dataset is relatively small in size (~ 14 hours), its application-driven and interactive nature brings to the fore novel research challenges for human-AI collaboration, and provides more realistic testing grounds for various AI models operating in this space. In future work, we plan to use the dataset to construct a set of benchmarks for physically situated collaboration in mixed-reality task assistive scenarios. SigmaCollab is available at https://github.com/microsoft/SigmaCollab.

<title>Adaptive GR(1) Specification Repair for Liveness-Preserving Shielding in Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Shielding is widely used to enforce safety in reinforcement learning (RL), ensuring that an agent's actions remain compliant with formal specifications. Classical shielding approaches, however, are often static, in the sense that they assume fixed logical specifications and hand-crafted abstractions. While these static shields provide safety under nominal assumptions, they fail to adapt when environment assumptions are violated. In this paper, we develop the first adaptive shielding framework - to the best of our knowledge - based on Generalized Reactivity of rank 1 (GR(1)) specifications, a tractable and expressive fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that captures both safety and liveness properties. Our method detects environment assumption violations at runtime and employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to automatically repair GR(1) specifications online, in a systematic and interpretable way. This ensures that the shield evolves gracefully, ensuring liveness is achievable and weakening goals only when necessary. We consider two case studies: Minepump and Atari Seaquest; showing that (i) static symbolic controllers are often severely suboptimal when optimizing for auxiliary rewards, and (ii) RL agents equipped with our adaptive shield maintain near-optimal reward and perfect logical compliance compared with static shields.

Abstract: Training and education in human-centered fields require authentic practice, yet realistic simulations of human behavior have remained limited. We present a multi-agent psychological simulation system that models internal cognitive-affective processes to generate believable human behaviors. In contrast to black-box neural models, this system is grounded in established psychological theories (e.g., self-efficacy, mindset, social constructivism) and explicitly simulates an ``inner parliament'' of agents corresponding to key psychological factors. These agents deliberate and interact to determine the system's output behavior, enabling unprecedented transparency and alignment with human psychology. We describe the system's architecture and theoretical foundations, illustrate its use in teacher training and research, and discuss how it embodies principles of social learning, cognitive apprenticeship, deliberate practice, and meta-cognition.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable reasoning capabilities through transformer architectures with attention mechanisms. However, transformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention module (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which severely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is critical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under high request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.
  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with linear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent computation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we introduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer attention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size. These models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained reasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing less critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.
  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with different SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as more Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant of Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces, achieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the production-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning performance. This shows that distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures can deliver substantial efficiency gains over the pretrained transformer equivalent without substantially compromising the reasoning quality.

Abstract: While conventional multinational firms (MNFs) often avoid taxes by transferring their profits to low-tax regions through markup on tangible asset costs, high-tech MNFs may avoid taxes by transferring royalty fees to intangible assets (i.e., royalty-based transfer prices). This study investigates the effects of tax differences, markups, and royalties on decision-making. We also compare the different effects of markups and royalties on the improvement of MNFs' after-tax profit under two main business structures: the commissionaire operational structure (C) with complete information, and the limited-risk operational structure (R) in the principal-agent setting. We find that the tax difference always improves MNFs' profits under the C structure, whereas non-monotonic behavior exists under the R structure. More interestingly, when the order quantity is relatively small, the markup improves MNFs' profits faster than the royalty; conversely, the royalty improves MNFs' profits faster than the markup.

Abstract: The trajectory of AI development suggests that we will increasingly rely on agent-based systems composed of independently developed agents with different information, privileges, and tools. The success of these systems will critically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents, even under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical studies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a collaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative capabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable automated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving ecological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and closed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our results reveal a "collaboration gap": models that perform well solo often degrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break down dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting with the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a "relay inference" approach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one, closing much of the gap. Our findings argue for (1) collaboration-aware evaluation, (2) training strategies developed to enhance collaborative capabilities, and (3) interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent skills, guidance that applies to AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Training agents to operate under strict constraints during deployment, such as limited resource budgets or stringent safety requirements, presents significant challenges, especially when these constraints render the task complex. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks. These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for resource-constrained deployment.

<title>CostBench: Evaluating Multi-Turn Cost-Optimal Planning and Adaptation in Dynamic Environments for LLM Tool-Use Agents</title>

Abstract: Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily emphasize task completion, often overlooking resource efficiency and adaptability. This neglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust cost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to adapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on CostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5 achieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. By diagnosing these weaknesses, CostBench lays the groundwork for developing future agents that are both economically rational and robust.

<title>Agentic World Modeling for 6G: Near-Real-Time Generative State-Space Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2511.02748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that sixth-generation (6G) intelligence is not fluent token prediction but the capacity to imagine and choose -- to simulate future scenarios, weigh trade-offs, and act with calibrated uncertainty. We reframe open radio access network (O-RAN) near-real-time (Near-RT) control via counterfactual dynamics and a world modeling (WM) paradigm that learns an action-conditioned generative state space. This enables quantitative "what-if" forecasting beyond large language models (LLMs) as the primary modeling primitive. Actions such as physical resource blocks (PRBs) are treated as first-class control inputs in a causal world model, and both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty are modeled for prediction and what-if analysis. An agentic, model predictive control (MPC)-based cross-entropy method (CEM) planner operates over short horizons, using prior-mean rollouts within data-driven PRB bounds to maximize a deterministic reward. The model couples multi-scale structured state-space mixtures (MS3M) with a compact stochastic latent to form WM-MS3M, summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs) histories and predicting next-step KPIs under hypothetical PRB sequences. On realistic O-RAN traces, WM-MS3M cuts mean absolute error (MAE) by 1.69% versus MS3M with 32% fewer parameters and similar latency, and achieves 35-80% lower root mean squared error (RMSE) than attention/hybrid baselines with 2.3-4.1x faster inference, enabling rare-event simulation and offline policy screening.

Abstract: Clients are evolving beyond chat completion, and now include a variety of innovative inference-time scaling and deep reasoning techniques. At the same time, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior work has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if inference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer solutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we introduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server. We demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads can all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that had been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter -- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper introduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked together with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and semantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache locality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can enable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we demonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two distinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be optimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called lost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span query on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock inference server using an 8b model.

<title>Controlling Performance and Budget of a Centralized Multi-agent LLM System with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths across domains and come with varying inference costs, motivating the design of multi-agent LLM systems where specialized models collaborate efficiently. Existing approaches predominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for every input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In this work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller LLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and cost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while minimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent system to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during inference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget setting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a single system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while maintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes, highlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.

<title>From Solo to Symphony: Orchestrating Multi-Agent Collaboration with Single-Agent Demos</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02762</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training a team of agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is highly inefficient, much like asking beginners to play a symphony together without first practicing solo. Existing methods, such as offline or transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g., collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data, making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.

<title>VCode: a Multimodal Coding Benchmark with SVG as Symbolic Visual Representation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02778</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.02778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically, frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i) Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual representation. The benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/CSU-JPG/VCode.

<title>1 PoCo: Agentic Proof-of-Concept Exploit Generation for Smart Contracts</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02780</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.02780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart contracts operate in a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, smart contracts are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security community.

Abstract: Despite rapid growth in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their reasoning traces remain opaque: it is often unclear which modality drives a prediction, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates. In this paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations. More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing possible interventions.

<title>MemSearcher: Training LLMs to Reason, Search and Manage Memory via End-to-End Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2511.02805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts, resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge, we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and lower computational overhead. The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/icip-cas/MemSearcher

Abstract: As AI deployments become more complex and high-stakes, it becomes increasingly important to be able to estimate their risk. AI control is one framework for doing so. However, good control evaluations require eliciting strong attack policies. This can be challenging in complex agentic environments where compute constraints leave us data-poor. In this work, we show how to optimize attack policies in SHADE-Arena, a dataset of diverse realistic control environments. We do this by decomposing attack capability into five constituent skills -- suspicion modeling, attack selection, plan synthesis, execution and subtlety -- and optimizing each component individually. To get around the constraint of limited data, we develop a probabilistic model of attack dynamics, optimize our attack hyperparameters using this simulation, and then show that the results transfer to SHADE-Arena. This results in a substantial improvement in attack strength, reducing safety score from a baseline of 0.87 to 0.41 using our scaffold.

Abstract: Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature search, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been made towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such agents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing coherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos, an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended objective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before synthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos uses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis agent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to coherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively executing an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run. Kosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature, ensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of statements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own research time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number of valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles (tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that span metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics. Three discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or unpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four make novel contributions to the scientific literature.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models become available. %We release an open-source implementation to support continued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Bond markets respond differently to macroeconomic news compared to equity markets, yet most sentiment models, including FinBERT, are trained primarily on general financial or equity news data. This mismatch is important because bond prices often move in the opposite direction to economic optimism, making general or equity-based sentiment tools potentially misleading. In this paper, we introduce BondBERT, a transformer-based language model fine-tuned on bond-specific news. BondBERT can act as the perception and reasoning component of a financial decision-support agent, providing sentiment signals that integrate with forecasting models. It is a generalisable framework for adapting transformers to low-volatility, domain-inverse sentiment tasks by compiling and cleaning 30,000 UK bond market articles (2018--2025) for training, validation, and testing. We compare BondBERT's sentiment predictions against FinBERT, FinGPT, and Instruct-FinGPT using event-based correlation, up/down accuracy analyses, and LSTM forecasting across ten UK sovereign bonds. We find that BondBERT consistently produces positive correlations with bond returns, achieves higher alignment and forecasting accuracy than the three baseline models, with lower normalised RMSE and higher information coefficient. These results demonstrate that domain-specific sentiment adaptation better captures fixed income dynamics, bridging a gap between NLP advances and bond market analytics.

Abstract: We present ABIDES-MARL, a framework that combines a new multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methodology with a new realistic limit-order-book (LOB) simulation system to study equilibrium behavior in complex financial market games. The system extends ABIDES-Gym by decoupling state collection from kernel interruption, enabling synchronized learning and decision-making for multiple adaptive agents while maintaining compatibility with standard RL libraries. It preserves key market features such as price-time priority and discrete tick sizes. Methodologically, we use MARL to approximate equilibrium-like behavior in multi-period trading games with a finite number of heterogeneous agents-an informed trader, a liquidity trader, noise traders, and competing market makers-all with individual price impacts. This setting bridges optimal execution and market microstructure by embedding the liquidity trader's optimization problem within a strategic trading environment. We validate the approach by solving an extended Kyle model within the simulation system, recovering the gradual price discovery phenomenon. We then extend the analysis to a liquidity trader's problem where market liquidity arises endogenously and show that, at equilibrium, execution strategies shape market-maker behavior and price dynamics. ABIDES-MARL provides a reproducible foundation for analyzing equilibrium and strategic adaptation in realistic markets and contributes toward building economically interpretable agentic AI systems for finance.

arXiv:2511.02136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based modelling (ABM) approaches for high-frequency financial markets are difficult to calibrate and validate, partly due to the large parameter space created by defining fixed agent policies. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) enables more realistic agent behaviour and reduces the number of free parameters, but the heavy computational cost has so far limited research efforts. To address this, we introduce JaxMARL-HFT (JAX-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for High-Frequency Trading), the first GPU-accelerated open-source multi-agent reinforcement learning environment for high-frequency trading (HFT) on market-by-order (MBO) data. Extending the JaxMARL framework and building on the JAX-LOB implementation, JaxMARL-HFT is designed to handle a heterogeneous set of agents, enabling diverse observation/action spaces and reward functions. It is designed flexibly, so it can also be used for single-agent RL, or extended to act as an ABM with fixed-policy agents. Leveraging JAX enables up to a 240x reduction in end-to-end training time, compared with state-of-the-art reference implementations on the same hardware. This significant speed-up makes it feasible to exploit the large, granular datasets available in high-frequency trading, and to perform the extensive hyperparameter sweeps required for robust and efficient MARL research in trading. We demonstrate the use of JaxMARL-HFT with independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) for a two-player environment, with an order execution and a market making agent, using one year of LOB data (400 million orders), and show that these agents learn to outperform standard benchmarks. The code for the JaxMARL-HFT framework is available on GitHub.

<title>Modeling Hawkish-Dovish Latent Beliefs in Multi-Agent Debate-Based LLMs for Monetary Policy Decision Classification</title>

arXiv:2511.02469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting central bank policy decisions, particularly those of the Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC) has become increasingly important amid heightened economic uncertainty. While prior studies have used monetary policy texts to predict rate changes, most rely on static classification models that overlook the deliberative nature of policymaking. This study proposes a novel framework that structurally imitates the FOMC's collective decision-making process by modeling multiple large language models(LLMs) as interacting agents. Each agent begins with a distinct initial belief and produces a prediction based on both qualitative policy texts and quantitative macroeconomic indicators. Through iterative rounds, agents revise their predictions by observing the outputs of others, simulating deliberation and consensus formation. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a latent variable representing each agent's underlying belief(e.g., hawkish or dovish), and we theoretically demonstrate how this belief mediates the perception of input information and interaction dynamics. Empirical results show that this debate-based approach significantly outperforms standard LLMs-based baselines in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the explicit modeling of beliefs provides insights into how individual perspectives and social influence shape collective policy forecasts.

Abstract: This paper presents a discrete-event stochastic model for the redistribution of indistinguishable personal items, exemplified by socks, among multiple cohabitants sharing a communal laundry system. Drawing on concepts from ecological population dynamics, diffusion processes, and stochastic exchange theory, the model captures the probabilistic mechanisms underlying item mixing, recovery, and loss. Each cohabitant is represented as an autonomous agent whose belongings interact through iterative cycles of collective washing, sorting, and partial correction. The system's evolution is characterized by random mixing events, selective recollection, and attrition over time. Implemented using the SimPy discrete-event simulation framework, the model demonstrates that even minimal exchange probabilities can generate emergent asymmetries, quasi-equilibrium distributions, and long-term disorder. The findings illustrate how stochastic processes inherent to shared domestic systems can produce persistent imbalances, offering a quantitative perspective on an everyday social phenomenon.

Abstract: We argue that the negative transfer problem occurring when the new task to learn arrives is an important problem that needs not be overlooked when developing effective Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) algorithms. Through comprehensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that such issue frequently exists in CRL and cannot be effectively addressed by several recent work on either mitigating plasticity loss of RL agents or enhancing the positive transfer in CRL scenario. To that end, we develop Reset & Distill (R&amp;D), a simple yet highly effective baseline method, to overcome the negative transfer problem in CRL. R&amp;D combines a strategy of resetting the agent's online actor and critic networks to learn a new task and an offline learning step for distilling the knowledge from the online actor and previous expert's action probabilities. We carried out extensive experiments on long sequence of Meta World tasks and show that our simple baseline method consistently outperforms recent approaches, achieving significantly higher success rates across a range of tasks. Our findings highlight the importance of considering negative transfer in CRL and emphasize the need for robust strategies like R&amp;D to mitigate its detrimental effects.

Abstract: As LLM-based agents become increasingly autonomous and will more freely interact with each other, studying the interplay among them becomes crucial to anticipate emergent phenomena and potential risks. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of the interactions among agents within a simulated hierarchical social environment, drawing inspiration from the Stanford Prison Experiment. Leveraging 2,400 conversations across six LLMs (i.e., LLama3, Orca2, Command-r, Mixtral, Mistral2, and gpt4.1) and 240 experimental scenarios, we analyze persuasion and anti-social behavior between a guard and a prisoner agent with differing objectives. We first document model-specific conversational failures in this multi-agent power dynamic context, thereby narrowing our analytic sample to 1,600 conversations. Among models demonstrating successful interaction, we find that goal setting significantly influences persuasiveness but not anti-social behavior. Moreover, agent personas, especially the guard's, substantially impact both successful persuasion by the prisoner and the manifestation of anti-social actions. Notably, we observe the emergence of anti-social conduct even in absence of explicit negative personality prompts. These results have important implications for the development of interactive LLM agents and the ongoing discussion of their societal impact.

Abstract: Humanoid robotics faces significant challenges in achieving stable locomotion and recovering from falls in dynamic environments. Traditional methods, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Key Frame Based (KFB) routines, either require extensive fine-tuning or lack real-time adaptability. This paper introduces FRASA, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent that integrates fall recovery and stand up strategies into a unified framework. Leveraging the Cross-Q algorithm, FRASA significantly reduces training time and offers a versatile recovery strategy that adapts to unpredictable disturbances. Comparative tests on Sigmaban humanoid robots demonstrate FRASA superior performance against the KFB method deployed in the RoboCup 2023 by the Rhoban Team, world champion of the KidSize League.

<title>Scaffolded Language Models with Language Supervision for Mixed-Autonomy: A Survey</title>

Abstract: This survey organizes the intricate literature on the design and optimization of emerging structures around post-trained LMs. We refer to this overarching structure as scaffolded LMs and focus on LMs that are integrated into multi-step processes with tools. We view scaffolded LMs as semi-parametric models wherein we train non-parametric variables, including the prompt, tools, and scaffold's code. In particular, they interpret instructions, use tools, and receive feedback all in language. Recent works use an LM as an optimizer to interpret language supervision and update non-parametric variables according to intricate objectives. In this survey, we refer to this paradigm as training of scaffolded LMs with language supervision. A key feature of non-parametric training is the ability to learn from language. Parametric training excels in learning from demonstration (supervised learning), exploration (reinforcement learning), or observations (unsupervised learning), using well-defined loss functions. Language-based optimization enables rich, interpretable, and expressive objectives, while mitigating issues like catastrophic forgetting and supporting compatibility with closed-source models. Furthermore, agents are increasingly deployed as co-workers in real-world applications such as Copilot in Office tools or software development. In these mixed-autonomy settings, where control and decision-making are shared between human and AI, users point out errors or suggest corrections. Accordingly, we discuss agents that continuously improve by learning from this real-time, language-based feedback and refer to this setting as streaming learning from language supervision.

<title>Constant Approximation for Weighted Nash Social Welfare with Submodular Valuations</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of assigning items to agents so as to maximize the \emph{weighted} Nash Social Welfare (NSW) under submodular valuations. The best-known result for the problem is an $O(nw_{\max})$-approximation due to Garg, Husic, Li, V\'egh, and Vondr\'ak~[STOC 2023], where $w_{\max}$ is the maximum weight over all agents. Obtaining a constant approximation algorithm is an open problem in the field that has recently attracted considerable attention.
  We give the first such algorithm for the problem, thus solving the open problem in the affirmative. Our algorithm is based on the natural Configuration LP for the problem, which was introduced recently by Feng and Li~[ICALP 2024] for the additive valuation case. Our rounding algorithm is similar to that of Li~[SODA 2025] developed for the unrelated machine scheduling problem to minimize weighted completion time. Roughly speaking, we designate the largest item in each configuration as a large item and the remaining items as small items. So, every agent gets precisely 1 fractional large item in the configuration LP solution. With the rounding algorithm in Li~[SODA 2025], we can ensure that in the obtained solution, every agent gets precisely 1 large item, and the assignments of small items are negatively correlated.

Abstract: Agentic workflows have become the dominant paradigm for building complex AI systems, orchestrating specialized components, such as planning, reasoning, action execution, and reflection, to tackle sophisticated real-world tasks. However, systematically analyzing and optimizing these workflows remains challenging due to intricate component interdependencies and the lack of principled attribution methods. In this work, we introduce ShapleyFlow, the first framework that employs cooperative game theory to analyze and optimize agentic workflows. By applying the Shapley value to evaluate all possible component configurations, ShapleyFlow enables fine-grained attribution of each component's contribution and facilitates the identification of task-specific optimal configurations. Through a constructed dataset evaluated across 7 scenarios, such as navigation, math and OS, we demonstrate 3 key contributions: (1) Theoretical Framework: a principled game-theoretic approach for the attribution of contributions in agentic workflows. (2) Optimal Workflow Discovery: ShapleyFlow identifies task-specific component configurations that consistently outperform workflows relying on a single LLM across all tested tasks. (3) Comprehensive Analysis: we construct and analyze over 1,500 tasks, providing actionable insights and design guidelines for optimizing workflows across multiple domains.

<title>Multi-Objective Planning with Contextual Lexicographic Reward Preferences</title>

Abstract: Autonomous agents are often required to plan under multiple objectives whose preference ordering varies based on context. The agent may encounter multiple contexts during its course of operation, each imposing a distinct lexicographic ordering over the objectives, with potentially different reward functions associated with each context. Existing approaches to multi-objective planning typically consider a single preference ordering over the objectives, across the state space, and do not support planning under multiple objective orderings within an environment. We present Contextual Lexicographic Markov Decision Process (CLMDP), a framework that enables planning under varying lexicographic objective orderings, depending on the context. In a CLMDP, both the objective ordering at a state and the associated reward functions are determined by the context. We employ a Bayesian approach to infer a state-context mapping from expert trajectories. Our algorithm to solve a CLMDP first computes a policy for each objective ordering and then combines them into a single context-aware policy that is valid and cycle-free. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in simulation and using a mobile robot.

Abstract: Many real-world eligibility problems, ranging from medical diagnosis to tax planning, can be mapped to decision problems expressed in natural language, wherein a model must make a binary choice based on user features. Large-scale domains such as legal codes or frequently updated funding opportunities render human annotation (e.g., web forms or decision trees) impractical, highlighting the need for agents that can automatically assist in decision-making. Since relevant information is often only known to the user, it is crucial that these agents ask the right questions. As agents determine when to terminate a conversation, they face a trade-off between accuracy and the number of questions asked, a key metric for both user experience and cost. To evaluate this task, we propose BeNYfits, a new benchmark for determining user eligibility for multiple overlapping social benefits opportunities through interactive decision-making. Our experiments show that current language models struggle with frequent hallucinations, with GPT-4o scoring only 35.7 F1 using a ReAct-style chain-of-thought. To address this, we introduce ProADA, a novel approach that leverages program synthesis to assist in decision-making by mapping dialog planning to a code generation problem and using gaps in structured data to determine the best next action. Our agent, ProADA, improves the F1 score to 55.6 while maintaining nearly the same number of dialog turns.

<title>Rethinking Bimanual Robotic Manipulation: Learning with Decoupled Interaction Framework</title>

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation is an emerging and critical topic in the robotics community. Previous works primarily rely on integrated control models that take the perceptions and states of both arms as inputs to directly predict their actions. However, we think bimanual manipulation involves not only coordinated tasks but also various uncoordinated tasks that do not require explicit cooperation during execution, such as grasping objects with the closest hand, which integrated control frameworks ignore to consider due to their enforced cooperation in the early inputs. In this paper, we propose a novel decoupled interaction framework that considers the characteristics of different tasks in bimanual manipulation. The key insight of our framework is to assign an independent model to each arm to enhance the learning of uncoordinated tasks, while introducing a selective interaction module that adaptively learns weights from its own arm to improve the learning of coordinated tasks. Extensive experiments on seven tasks in the RoboTwin dataset demonstrate that: (1) Our framework achieves outstanding performance, with a 23.5% boost over the SOTA method. (2) Our framework is flexible and can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods. (3) Our framework can be effectively extended to multi-agent manipulation tasks, achieving a 28% boost over the integrated control SOTA. (4) The performance boost stems from the decoupled design itself, surpassing the SOTA by 16.5% in success rate with only 1/6 of the model size.

Abstract: Recent advances in operating system (OS) agents have enabled vision-language models (VLMs) to directly control a user's computer. Unlike conventional VLMs that passively output text, OS agents autonomously perform computer-based tasks in response to a single user prompt. OS agents do so by capturing, parsing, and analysing screenshots and executing low-level actions via application programming interfaces (APIs), such as mouse clicks and keyboard inputs. This direct interaction with the OS significantly raises the stakes, as failures or manipulations can have immediate and tangible consequences. In this work, we uncover a novel attack vector against these OS agents: Malicious Image Patches (MIPs), adversarially perturbed screen regions that, when captured by an OS agent, induce it to perform harmful actions by exploiting specific APIs. For instance, a MIP can be embedded in a desktop wallpaper or shared on social media to cause an OS agent to exfiltrate sensitive user data. We show that MIPs generalise across user prompts and screen configurations, and that they can hijack multiple OS agents even during the execution of benign instructions. These findings expose critical security vulnerabilities in OS agents that have to be carefully addressed before their widespread deployment.

Abstract: Data scarcity is a long-standing challenge in the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) field, which extremely hinders the generalization of agents to unseen environments. Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or web-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the simulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data often requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a Rewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates the unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training data. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction pairs can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via Text-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast Instruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten instructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and new observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy with a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data distribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during training. Experiments on both the discrete environments (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R datasets) and continuous environments (R2R-CE dataset) show the superior performance and impressive generalization ability of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/SaDil13/VLN-RAM.

Abstract: This work investigates the challenge of ensuring safety guarantees under uncontrollable agents whose behaviors are stochastic and depend on both their own and the system's states. We present a neural model predictive control (MPC) framework that predicts the trajectory of the uncontrollable agent using a predictor learned from offline data. To provide probabilistic guarantees on prediction errors, we employ split conformal prediction to construct region-specific, time-dependent uncertainty bounds, which are integrated into the MPC formulation. To solve the resulting non-convex, discontinuous optimization problem, we propose a two-loop iterative sequential convex programming algorithm. The inner loop solves convexified subproblems with fixed error bounds, while the outer loop refines these bounds based on updated control sequences. We establish convergence guarantees under mild regularity conditions and demonstrate the optimality of the algorithm. We illustrate our method with an autonomous driving scenario involving interactive pedestrians. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior safety and efficiency compared to baseline methods, with success rates exceeding 99.5\% while maintaining higher average speeds in multi-pedestrian scenarios.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) depends on how they are prompted, with choices spanning both the high-level prompting pattern (e.g., Zero-Shot, CoT, ReAct, ReWOO) and the specific prompt content (instructions and few-shot demonstrations). Manually tuning this combination is tedious, error-prone, and specific to a given LLM and task. Therefore, this paper proposes AutoPDL, an automated approach to discovering good LLM agent configurations. Our approach frames this as a structured AutoML problem over a combinatorial space of agentic and non-agentic prompting patterns and demonstrations, using successive halving to efficiently navigate this space. We introduce a library implementing common prompting patterns using the PDL prompt programming language. AutoPDL solutions are human-readable, editable, and executable PDL programs that use this library. This approach also enables source-to-source optimization, allowing human-in-the-loop refinement and reuse. Evaluations across three tasks and seven LLMs (ranging from 3B to 70B parameters) show consistent accuracy gains ($9.21\pm15.46$ percentage points), up to 67.5pp, and reveal that selected prompting strategies vary across models and tasks.

Abstract: We study the problem of allocating items to agents with submodular valuations with the goal of maximizing the weighted Nash social welfare (NSW). The best-known results for unweighted and weighted objectives are the $(4+\epsilon)$ approximation given by Garg, Husic, Li, V\'egh, and Vondr\'ak~[STOC 2023] and the $(233+\epsilon)$ approximation given by Feng, Hu, Li, and Zhang~[STOC 2025], respectively.
  In this work, we present a $(3.56+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for weighted NSW maximization with submodular valuations, simultaneously improving the previous approximation ratios of both the weighted and unweighted NSW problems. Our algorithm solves the configuration LP of Feng, Hu, Li, and Zhang~[STOC 2025] via a stronger separation oracle that loses an $e/(e-1)$ factor only on small items, and then rounds the solution via a new bipartite multigraph construction. Some key technical ingredients of our analysis include a greedy proxy function, additive within each configuration, that preserves the LP value while lower-bounding the rounded solution, together with refined concentration bounds and a series of mathematical programs analyzed partly by computer assistance.
  On the hardness side, we prove that the configuration LP for weighted NSW with submodular valuations has an integrality gap of at least $(2^{\ln 2}-\epsilon) \approx 1.617 - \epsilon$, which is larger than the current best-known $e/(e-1)-\epsilon \approx 1.582-\epsilon$ hardness~[SODA 2020]. For additive valuations, we show an integrality gap of $(e^{1/e}-\epsilon)$, which proves the tightness of the approximation ratio in~[ICALP 2024] for algorithms based on the configuration LP. For unweighted NSW with additive valuations, we show an integrality gap of $(2^{1/4}-\epsilon) \approx 1.189-\epsilon$, again larger than the current best-known $\sqrt{8/7} \approx 1.069$-hardness for the problem~[Math. Oper. Res. 2024].

Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM previously used to investigate in vitro vasculogenesis. The surrogate model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps, MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater spatial and temporal scales.

Abstract: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) enables agents to autonomously acquire diverse behaviors, but faces major challenges in visual environments due to high-dimensional, semantically sparse observations. In the online setting, where agents learn representations while exploring, the latent space evolves with the agent's policy, to capture newly discovered areas of the environment. However, without incentivization to maximize state coverage in the representation, classical approaches based on auto-encoders may converge to latent spaces that over-represent a restricted set of states frequently visited by the agent. This is exacerbated in an intrinsic motivation setting, where the agent uses the distribution encoded in the latent space to sample the goals it learns to master. To address this issue, we propose to progressively enforce distributional shifts towards a uniform distribution over the full state space, to ensure a full coverage of skills that can be learned in the environment. We introduce DRAG (Distributionally Robust Auto-Encoding for GCRL), a method that combines the $\beta$-VAE framework with Distributionally Robust Optimization. DRAG leverages an adversarial neural weighter of training states of the VAE, to account for the mismatch between the current data distribution and unseen parts of the environment. This allows the agent to construct semantically meaningful latent spaces beyond its immediate experience. Our approach improves state space coverage and downstream control performance on hard exploration environments such as mazes and robotic control involving walls to bypass, without pre-training nor prior environment knowledge.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have shown promising capabilities in a growing range of software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, advancing this field faces two critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to contamination issues.

Abstract: The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing on multi-agent task allocation problems, we study this question from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$ task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneity Gain Parameter Search (HetGPS), a gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous. Across different environments, we show that HetGPS rediscovers the reward regimes predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both validating HetGPS and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity delivers a measurable benefit.

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is essential for validating the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, such testing is limited by the scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic adversarial traffic interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions, which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input, and reconstructs the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions. Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce episode collision rates by 20%.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is redefining the frontiers of scientific domains, ranging from drug discovery to meteorological modeling, yet its integration within industrial manufacturing remains nascent and fraught with operational challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce Aethorix v1.0, an AI agent framework designed to overcome key industrial bottlenecks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in materials design innovation and process parameter optimization. Our tool is built upon three pillars: a scientific corpus reasoning engine that streamlines knowledge retrieval and validation, a diffusion-based generative model for zero-shot inverse design, and specialized interatomic potentials that enable faster screening with ab initio fidelity. We demonstrate Aethorix's utility through a real-world cement production case study, confirming its capacity for integration into industrial workflows and its role in revolutionizing the design-make-test-analyze loop while ensuring rigorous manufacturing standards are met.

Abstract: AI research agents are demonstrating great potential to accelerate scientific progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine learning models. We focus on methods for improving agents' performance on MLE-bench, a challenging benchmark where agents compete in Kaggle competitions to solve real-world machine learning problems. We formalize AI research agents as search policies that navigate a space of candidate solutions, iteratively modifying them using operators. By designing and systematically varying different operator sets and search policies (Greedy, MCTS, Evolutionary), we show that their interplay is critical for achieving high performance. Our best pairing of search strategy and operator set achieves a state-of-the-art result on MLE-bench lite, increasing the success rate of achieving a Kaggle medal from 39.6% to 47.7%. Our investigation underscores the importance of jointly considering the search strategy, operator design, and evaluation methodology in advancing automated machine learning.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems introduce security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional content generation to system-level compromises. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs security used as reasoning engines within autonomous agents, highlighting how they can be exploited as attack vectors capable of achieving computer takeovers. We focus on how different attack surfaces and trust boundaries can be leveraged to orchestrate such takeovers. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively coerce popular LLMs into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming scenario: 94.4% of models succumb to Direct Prompt Injection, and 83.3% are vulnerable to the more stealthy and evasive RAG Backdoor Attack. Notably, we tested trust boundaries within multi-agent systems, where LLM agents interact and influence each other, and we revealed that LLMs which successfully resist direct injection or RAG backdoor attacks will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents. We found that 100.0% of tested LLMs can be compromised through Inter-Agent Trust Exploitation attacks, and that every model exhibits context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots.

Abstract: Policy as Code (PaC) is a paradigm that encodes security and compliance policies into machine-readable formats, enabling automated enforcement in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) environments. However, its adoption is hindered by the complexity of policy languages and the risk of misconfigurations. In this work, we present ARPaCCino, an agentic system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and tool-based validation to automate the generation and verification of PaC rules. Given natural language descriptions of the desired policies, ARPaCCino generates formal Rego rules, assesses IaC compliance, and iteratively refines the IaC configurations to ensure conformance. Thanks to its modular agentic architecture and integration with external tools and knowledge bases, ARPaCCino supports policy validation across a wide range of technologies, including niche or emerging IaC frameworks. Experimental evaluation involving a Terraform-based case study demonstrates ARPaCCino's effectiveness in generating syntactically and semantically correct policies, identifying non-compliant infrastructures, and applying corrective modifications, even when using smaller, open-weight LLMs. Our results highlight the potential of agentic RAG architectures to enhance the automation, reliability, and accessibility of PaC workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in multi-agent scenarios where coordination is crucial but not always assured. Research shows that the way strategic scenarios are framed linguistically can affect cooperation. This paper explores whether allowing agents to communicate amplifies these language-driven effects. Leveraging FAIRGAME, we simulate one-shot and repeated games across different languages and models, both with and without communication. Our experiments, conducted with two advanced LLMs-GPT-4o and Llama 4 Maverick-reveal that communication significantly influences agent behavior, though its impact varies by language, personality, and game structure. These findings underscore the dual role of communication in fostering coordination and reinforcing biases.

<title>Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models</title>

Abstract: Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), which uses the agent's own policy to simulate future states. A Message Generation Network (MGN) then compresses this plan into a message. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems, while scaling environmental complexity. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.

Abstract: Coordinating workflows across complex systems remains a central challenge in safety-critical environments such as scientific facilities. Language-model-driven agents offer a natural interface for these tasks, but existing approaches often lack scalability, reliability, and human oversight. We introduce the Osprey Framework, a domain-agnostic, production-ready architecture for scalable agentic systems that integrate conversational context with robust tool orchestration across safety-critical domains. Our framework provides: (i) dynamic capability classification to select only relevant tools; (ii) plan-first orchestration with explicit dependencies and optional human approval; (iii) context-aware task extraction that combines dialogue history with external memory and domain resources; and (iv) production-ready execution with checkpointing, artifact management, and modular deployment. We demonstrate its versatility through two case studies: a deployment at the Advanced Light Source particle accelerator and a tutorial-style wind farm monitoring example. These results establish Osprey as a reliable and transparent framework for agentic systems across diverse high-stakes domains.

Abstract: The advancement of general-purpose intelligent agents is intrinsically linked to the environments in which they are trained. While scaling models and datasets has yielded remarkable capabilities, scaling the complexity, diversity, and interactivity of environments remains a crucial bottleneck. Hand-crafted environments are finite and often contain implicit biases, limiting the potential for agents to develop truly generalizable and robust skills. In this work, we propose a paradigm for generating a boundless and adaptive curriculum of challenges by framing the environment generation process as an adversarial game. We introduce a system where a team of cooperative multi-agent defenders learns to survive against a procedurally generative attacker. The attacker agent learns to produce increasingly challenging configurations of enemy units, dynamically creating novel worlds tailored to exploit the defenders' current weaknesses. Concurrently, the defender team learns cooperative strategies to overcome these generated threats. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates a self-scaling environment where complexity arises organically from the adversarial interaction, providing an effectively infinite stream of novel and relevant training data. We demonstrate that with minimal training, this approach leads to the emergence of complex, intelligent behaviors, such as flanking and shielding by the attacker, and focus-fire and spreading by the defenders. Our findings suggest that adversarial co-evolution is a powerful mechanism for automatically scaling environmental complexity, driving agents towards greater robustness and strategic depth.

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10 items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles, taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Abstract: The capacity of an embodied agent to understand, predict, and interact with its environment is fundamentally contingent on an internal world model. This paper introduces a novel framework for investigating the formation and adaptation of such world models within a biological substrate: human neural organoids. We present a curriculum of three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train these biological agents and probe the underlying synaptic mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments that demand progressively more sophisticated world models for successful decision-making: (1) a conditional avoidance task for learning static state-action contingencies, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario for goal-directed interaction, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game for modeling dynamic, continuous-time systems. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation, which serve to drive model refinement. In a significant methodological advance, we propose a meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model automates the generative design and optimization of experimental protocols, thereby scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal evaluation strategy that moves beyond task performance to directly measure the physical correlates of the learned world model by quantifying synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between model-based reinforcement learning and computational neuroscience, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, decision-making, and the physical basis of intelligence.

Abstract: Recent advances in agent development have focused on scaling model size and raw interaction data, mirroring successes in large language models. However, for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks such as robotic soccer, this end-to-end approach often fails due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. We propose that an effective world model for decision-making must model the world's physics and also its task semantics. A systematic review of 2024 research in low-resource multi-agent soccer reveals a clear trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods, such as Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and Bayesian Strategy Networks (BSNs), with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These methods decompose complex goals into manageable subgoals, creating an intrinsic curriculum that shapes agent learning. We formalize this trend into a framework for Hierarchical Task Environments (HTEs), which are essential for bridging the gap between simple, reactive behaviors and sophisticated, strategic team play. Our framework incorporates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as generative world models of tasks, capable of dynamically generating this scaffolding. We argue that HTEs provide a mechanism to guide exploration, generate meaningful learning signals, and train agents to internalize hierarchical structure, enabling the development of more capable and general-purpose agents with greater sample efficiency than purely end-to-end approaches.

<title>LLMs as Layout Designers: Enhanced Spatial Reasoning for Content-Aware Layout Generation</title>

arXiv:2509.16891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning and planning abilities in textual domains and can effectively follow instructions for complex tasks, their ability to understand and manipulate spatial relationships remains limited. Such capabilities are crucial for content-aware graphic layout design, where the goal is to arrange heterogeneous elements onto a canvas so that final design remains visually balanced and structurally feasible. This problem requires precise coordination of placement, alignment, and structural organization of multiple elements within a constrained visual space. To address this limitation, we introduce LaySPA, a reinforcement learning-based framework that augments LLM-based agents with explicit spatial reasoning capabilities for layout design. LaySPA employs hybrid reward signals that jointly capture geometric constraints, structural fidelity, and visual quality, enabling agents to navigate the canvas, model inter-element relationships, and optimize spatial arrangements. Through group-relative policy optimization, the agent generates content-aware layouts that reflect salient regions, respect spatial constraints, and produces an interpretable reasoning trace explaining placement decisions and a structured layout specification. Experimental results show that LaySPA substantially improves the generation of structurally valid and visually appealing layouts, outperforming larger general-purpose LLMs and achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art specialized layout models.

Abstract: Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and generation, but their use as autonomous agents introduces architectural challenges for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often mix cognition, memory, and control in a single prompt, reducing coherence and predictability. The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is proposed as an alternative architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model handles cognition, memory is stored externally, and execution is guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design allows intermediate results to be recorded and verified before actions are taken, improving traceability and evaluation. SCL is evaluated against prompt-based baselines such as ReAct and LangChain agents across three tasks: travel planning, conditional email drafting, and constraint-guided image generation. Under matched settings, SCL achieves an average task success rate of 86.3 percent, compared with 70.5 to 76.8 percent for baselines. It also shows higher goal fidelity, fewer redundant calls, and reduced unsupported assertions. These results indicate that separating cognition, memory, and control can enhance reliability and interpretability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The findings should be regarded as preliminary evidence, with broader tests across model families and task domains planned for future work.

<title>Deterministic Legal Agents: A Canonical Primitive API for Auditable Reasoning over Temporal Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: For autonomous legal agents to operate safely in high-stakes domains, they require a foundation of absolute determinism and auditability-guarantees that standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks cannot provide. When interacting with temporal knowledge graphs that model the complex evolution of legal norms, agents must navigate versioning, causality, and hierarchical structures with precision, a task for which black-box vector search is ill-suited. This paper introduces a new architectural pattern to solve this: a formal Primitive API designed as a secure execution layer for reasoning over such graphs. Instead of a monolithic query engine, our framework provides a library of canonical primitives-atomic, composable, and auditable primitives. This design empowers planner-guided agents to decompose complex legal questions into transparent execution plans, enabling critical tasks with full verifiability, including: (i) precise point-in-time version retrieval, (ii) robust causal lineage tracing, and (iii) context-aware hybrid search. Ultimately, this architecture transforms opaque retrieval into auditable reasoning, turning the agent's internal process from a black box into a verifiable log of deterministic primitives and providing a blueprint for building the next generation of trustworthy legal AI.

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in aligning large language model (LLM) with human preferences. As real-world applications increasingly involve long history trajectories, e.g., LLM agent, it becomes indispensable to evaluate whether a model's responses are not only high-quality but also grounded in and consistent with the provided context. Yet, current RMs remain confined to short-context settings and primarily focus on response-level attributes (e.g., safety or helpfulness), while largely neglecting the critical dimension of long context-response consistency. In this work, we introduce Long-RewardBench, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context RM evaluation, featuring both Pairwise Comparison and Best-of-N tasks. Our preliminary study reveals that even state-of-the-art generative RMs exhibit significant fragility in long-context scenarios, failing to maintain context-aware preference judgments. Motivated by the analysis of failure patterns observed in model outputs, we propose a general multi-stage training strategy that effectively scales arbitrary models into robust Long-context RMs (LongRMs). Experiments show that our approach not only substantially improves performance on long-context evaluation but also preserves strong short-context capability. Notably, our 8B LongRM outperforms much larger 70B-scale baselines and matches the performance of the proprietary Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains, they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands, collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone, planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing confidence intervals by 40% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance (e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and identify opportunities for better agent designs.

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of AI systems remains a fundamental challenge when ground truth labels are unavailable, particularly for systems generating natural language outputs like AI chat and agent systems. Many of these AI agents and systems focus on entity-centric tasks. In enterprise contexts, organizations deploy AI systems for entity linking, data integration, and information retrieval where verification against gold standards is often infeasible due to proprietary data constraints. Academic deployments face similar challenges when evaluating AI systems on specialized datasets with ambiguous criteria. Conventional evaluation frameworks, rooted in supervised learning paradigms, fail in such scenarios where single correct answers cannot be defined. We introduce VB-Score, a variance-bounded evaluation framework for entity-centric AI systems that operates without ground truth by jointly measuring effectiveness and robustness. Given system inputs, VB-Score enumerates plausible interpretations through constraint relaxation and Monte Carlo sampling, assigning probabilities that reflect their likelihood. It then evaluates system outputs by their expected success across interpretations, penalized by variance to assess robustness of the system. We provide formal theoretical analysis establishing key properties including range, monotonicity, and stability along with concentration bounds for Monte Carlo estimation. Through case studies on AI systems with ambiguous inputs, we demonstrate that VB-Score reveals robustness differences hidden by conventional evaluation frameworks, offering a principled measurement framework for assessing AI system reliability in label-scarce domains.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has rapidly become a mainstream platform for gaming and interactive experiences, yet ensuring the quality, safety, and appropriateness of VR content remains a pressing challenge. Traditional human-based quality assurance is labor-intensive and cannot scale with the industry's rapid growth. While automated testing has been applied to traditional 2D and 3D games, extending it to VR introduces unique difficulties due to high-dimensional sensory inputs and strict real-time performance requirements. We present VRScout, a deep learning-based agent capable of autonomously navigating VR environments and interacting with virtual objects in a human-like and real-time manner. VRScout learns from human demonstrations using an enhanced Action Chunking Transformer that predicts multi-step action sequences. This enables our agent to capture higher-level strategies and generalize across diverse environments. To balance responsiveness and precision, we introduce a dynamically adjustable sliding horizon that adapts the agent's temporal context at runtime. We evaluate VRScout on commercial VR titles and show that it achieves expert-level performance with only limited training data, while maintaining real-time inference at 60 FPS on consumer-grade hardware. These results position VRScout as a practical and scalable framework for automated VR game testing, with direct applications in both quality assurance and safety auditing.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable profi- ciency in code generation. However, their ability to create complex visualiza- tions for scaled and structured data remains largely unevaluated and underdevel- oped. To address this gap, we introduce PlotCraft, a new benchmark featuring 1k challenging visualization tasks that cover a wide range of topics, such as fi- nance, scientific research, and sociology. The benchmark is structured around seven high-level visualization tasks and encompasses 48 distinct chart types. Cru- cially, it is the first to systematically evaluate both single-turn generation and multi-turn refinement across a diverse spectrum of task complexities. Our com- prehensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs on PlotCraft reveals obvious per- formance deficiencies in handling sophisticated visualization tasks. To bridge this performance gap, we develope SynthVis-30K, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of complex visualization code synthesized via a collaborative agent frame- work. Building upon this dataset, we develope PlotCraftor, a novel code gener- ation model that achieves strong capabilities in complex data visualization with a remarkably small size. Across VisEval, PandasPlotBench, and our proposed PlotCraft, PlotCraftor shows performance comparable to that of leading propri- etary approaches. Especially, on hard task, Our model achieves over 50% per- formance improvement. We will release the benchmark, dataset, and code at https://github.com/Speakn0w/PlotCraft-Benchmark.

Abstract: In the current digital commerce landscape, user-generated reviews play a critical role in shaping consumer behavior, product reputation, and platform credibility. However, the proliferation of fake or misleading reviews often generated by bots, paid agents, or AI models poses a significant threat to trust and transparency within review ecosystems. Existing detection models primarily rely on unimodal, typically textual, data and therefore fail to capture semantic inconsistencies across different modalities. To address this gap, a robust multimodal fake review detection framework is proposed, integrating textual features encoded with BERT and visual features extracted using ResNet-50. These representations are fused through a classification head to jointly predict review authenticity. To support this approach, a curated dataset comprising 21,142 user-uploaded images across food delivery, hospitality, and e-commerce domains was utilized. Experimental results indicate that the multimodal model outperforms unimodal baselines, achieving an F1-score of 0.934 on the test set. Additionally, the confusion matrix and qualitative analysis highlight the model's ability to detect subtle inconsistencies, such as exaggerated textual praise paired with unrelated or low-quality images, commonly found in deceptive content. This study demonstrates the critical role of multimodal learning in safeguarding digital trust and offers a scalable solution for content moderation across various online platforms.

<title>STRIDER: Navigation via Instruction-Aligned Structural Decision Space Optimization</title>

Abstract: The Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) task requires agents to navigate previously unseen 3D environments using natural language instructions, without any scene-specific training. A critical challenge in this setting lies in ensuring agents' actions align with both spatial structure and task intent over long-horizon execution. Existing methods often fail to achieve robust navigation due to a lack of structured decision-making and insufficient integration of feedback from previous actions. To address these challenges, we propose STRIDER (Instruction-Aligned Structural Decision Space Optimization), a novel framework that systematically optimizes the agent's decision space by integrating spatial layout priors and dynamic task feedback. Our approach introduces two key innovations: 1) a Structured Waypoint Generator that constrains the action space through spatial structure, and 2) a Task-Alignment Regulator that adjusts behavior based on task progress, ensuring semantic alignment throughout navigation. Extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate that STRIDER significantly outperforms strong SOTA across key metrics; in particular, it improves Success Rate (SR) from 29% to 35%, a relative gain of 20.7%. Such results highlight the importance of spatially constrained decision-making and feedback-guided execution in improving navigation fidelity for zero-shot VLN-CE.

<title>On the Fundamental Limitations of Decentralized Learnable Reward Shaping in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in learnable reward shaping have shown promise in single-agent reinforcement learning by automatically discovering effective feedback signals. However, the effectiveness of decentralized learnable reward shaping in cooperative multi-agent settings remains poorly understood. We propose DMARL-RSA, a fully decentralized system where each agent learns individual reward shaping, and evaluate it on cooperative navigation tasks in the simple_spread_v3 environment. Despite sophisticated reward learning, DMARL-RSA achieves only -24.20 +/- 0.09 average reward, compared to MAPPO with centralized training at 1.92 +/- 0.87--a 26.12-point gap. DMARL-RSA performs similarly to simple independent learning (IPPO: -23.19 +/- 0.96), indicating that advanced reward shaping cannot overcome fundamental decentralized coordination limitations. Interestingly, decentralized methods achieve higher landmark coverage (0.888 +/- 0.029 for DMARL-RSA, 0.960 +/- 0.045 for IPPO out of 3 total) but worse overall performance than centralized MAPPO (0.273 +/- 0.008 landmark coverage)--revealing a coordination paradox between local optimization and global performance. Analysis identifies three critical barriers: (1) non-stationarity from concurrent policy updates, (2) exponential credit assignment complexity, and (3) misalignment between individual reward optimization and global objectives. These results establish empirical limits for decentralized reward learning and underscore the necessity of centralized coordination for effective multi-agent cooperation.

Abstract: Dynamic pricing in retail requires policies that adapt to shifting demand while coordinating decisions across related products. We present a systematic empirical study of multi-agent reinforcement learning for retail price optimization, comparing a strong MAPPO baseline with a graph-attention-augmented variant (MAPPO+GAT) that leverages learned interactions among products. Using a simulated pricing environment derived from real transaction data, we evaluate profit, stability across random seeds, fairness across products, and training efficiency under a standardized evaluation protocol. The results indicate that MAPPO provides a robust and reproducible foundation for portfolio-level price control, and that MAPPO+GAT further enhances performance by sharing information over the product graph without inducing excessive price volatility. These results indicate that graph-integrated MARL provides a more scalable and stable solution than independent learners for dynamic retail pricing, offering practical advantages in multi-product decision-making.

<title>Endowing GPT-4 with a Humanoid Body: Building the Bridge Between Off-the-Shelf VLMs and the Physical World</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00041</link>

Abstract: Humanoid agents often struggle to handle flexible and diverse interactions in open environments. A common solution is to collect massive datasets to train a highly capable model, but this approach can be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we explore an alternative solution: empowering off-the-shelf Vision-Language Models (VLMs, such as GPT-4) to control humanoid agents, thereby leveraging their strong open-world generalization to mitigate the need for extensive data collection. To this end, we present \textbf{BiBo} (\textbf{B}uilding humano\textbf{I}d agent \textbf{B}y \textbf{O}ff-the-shelf VLMs). It consists of two key components: (1) an \textbf{embodied instruction compiler}, which enables the VLM to perceive the environment and precisely translate high-level user instructions (e.g., {\small\itshape ``have a rest''}) into low-level primitive commands with control parameters (e.g., {\small\itshape ``sit casually, location: (1, 2), facing: 90$^\circ$''}); and (2) a diffusion-based \textbf{motion executor}, which generates human-like motions from these commands, while dynamically adapting to physical feedback from the environment. In this way, BiBo is capable of handling not only basic interactions but also diverse and complex motions. Experiments demonstrate that BiBo achieves an interaction task success rate of 90.2\% in open environments, and improves the precision of text-guided motion execution by 16.3\% over prior methods. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: GEPOC, short for Generic Population Concept, is a collection of models and methods for analysing population-level research questions. For the valid application of the models for a specific country or region, stable and reproducible data processes are necessary, which provide valid and ready-to-use model parameters. This work contains a complete description of the data-processing methods for computation of model parameters for Austria, based exclusively on freely and publicly accessible data. In addition to the description of the source data used, this includes all algorithms used for aggregation, disaggregation, fusion, cleansing or scaling of the data, as well as a description of the resulting parameter files. The document places particular emphasis on the computation of parameters for the most important GEPOC model, GEPOC ABM, a continuous-time agent-based population model. An extensive validation study using this particular model was made and is presented at the end of this work.

<title>Token-Regulated Group Relative Policy Optimization for Stable Reinforcement Learning in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful approach for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among existing algorithms, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated strong performance, yet it suffers from a critical issue: low-probability tokens disproportionately dominate gradient updates due to their inherently large gradient magnitudes. This imbalance leads to unstable training and suppresses the contribution of high-probability tokens that are more reliable for learning. In this work, we introduce Token-Regulated Group Relative Policy Optimization (TR-GRPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that assigns token-level weights positively correlated with the model's predicted probability. By downweighting low-probability tokens and emphasizing high-probability ones, TR-GRPO mitigates gradient over-amplification while preserving informative learning signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TR-GRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across RLVR tasks, including logic, math, and agentic reasoning, highlighting the importance of regulating token contributions during RL training and establishing TR-GRPO as a robust framework for enhancing LLM reasoning.

<title>Generalizing Test-time Compute-optimal Scaling as an Optimizable Graph</title>

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference, typically through parallel, sequential, or hybrid scaling. However, prior studies often assume fixed collaboration architectures (e.g., topologies) and single-model usage, overlooking that optimal architectures and model combinations can vary across tasks. Therefore, we study the novel problem of searching for compute-optimal model combinations and architectures in TTS under a fixed budget. We formalize it as a multi-LLM collaboration graph, where nodes encode roles and LLM model assignments, and edges capture information flow. This problem is challenging because (i) the combinatorial search space is prohibitively large, and (ii) task-specific requirements demand tailored designs. To address these, we reformulate the problem as probabilistic graph optimization and, through pilot experiments, derive three empirical insights into TTS collaboration graphs. Guided by these insights, we propose Agent-REINFORCE, an LLM-agent-augmented framework that mirrors the REINFORCE pipeline by mapping sampling-gradient-update to sampling-feedback-update, where feedback serves as a textual gradient to update the probabilistic graph and efficiently search for optimal multi-LLM collaboration graphs. Experiments show that Agent-REINFORCE outperforms both traditional and LLM-based baselines in sample efficiency and search performance, and effectively identifies optimal graphs under joint objectives of accuracy and inference latency.

Abstract: Urban Artificial Intelligence (Urban AI) has advanced human-centered urban tasks such as perception prediction and human dynamics. Large Language Models (LLMs) can integrate multimodal inputs to address heterogeneous data in complex urban systems but often underperform on domain-specific tasks. Urban-MAS, an LLM-based Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework, is introduced for human- centered urban prediction under zero-shot settings. It includes three agent types: Predictive Factor Guidance Agents, which prioritize key predictive factors to guide knowledge extraction and enhance the effectiveness of compressed urban knowledge in LLMs; Reliable UrbanInfo Extraction Agents, which improve robustness by com- paring multiple outputs, validating consistency, and re-extracting when conflicts occur; and Multi-UrbanInfo Inference Agents, which integrate extracted multi-source information across dimensions for prediction. Experiments on running-amount prediction and ur- ban perception across Tokyo, Milan, and Seattle demonstrate that Urban-MAS substantially reduces errors compared to single-LLM baselines. Ablation studies indicate that Predictive Factor Guidance Agents are most critical for enhancing predictive performance, po- sitioning Urban-MAS as a scalable paradigm for human-centered urban AI prediction.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Real-DRL framework for safety-critical autonomous systems, enabling runtime learning of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to develop safe and high-performance action policies in real plants (i.e., real physical systems to be controlled), while prioritizing safety! The Real-DRL consists of three interactive components: a DRL-Student, a PHY-Teacher, and a Trigger. The DRL-Student is a DRL agent that innovates in the dual self-learning and teaching-to-learn paradigm and the real-time safety-informed batch sampling. On the other hand, PHY-Teacher is a physics-model-based design of action policies that focuses solely on safety-critical functions. PHY-Teacher is novel in its real-time patch for two key missions: i) fostering the teaching-to-learn paradigm for DRL-Student and ii) backing up the safety of real plants. The Trigger manages the interaction between the DRL-Student and the PHY-Teacher. Powered by the three interactive components, the Real-DRL can effectively address safety challenges that arise from the unknown unknowns and the Sim2Real gap. Additionally, Real-DRL notably features i) assured safety, ii) automatic hierarchy learning (i.e., safety-first learning and then high-performance learning), and iii) safety-informed batch sampling to address the learning experience imbalance caused by corner cases. Experiments with a real quadruped robot, a quadruped robot in NVIDIA Isaac Gym, and a cart-pole system, along with comparisons and ablation studies, demonstrate the Real-DRL's effectiveness and unique features.

Abstract: Liquid cooling is critical for thermal management in high-density data centers with the rising AI workloads. However, machine learning-based controllers are essential to unlock greater energy efficiency and reliability, promoting sustainability. We present LC-Opt, a Sustainable Liquid Cooling (LC) benchmark environment, for reinforcement learning (RL) control strategies in energy-efficient liquid cooling of high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Built on the baseline of a high-fidelity digital twin of Oak Ridge National Lab's Frontier Supercomputer cooling system, LC-Opt provides detailed Modelica-based end-to-end models spanning site-level cooling towers to data center cabinets and server blade groups. RL agents optimize critical thermal controls like liquid supply temperature, flow rate, and granular valve actuation at the IT cabinet level, as well as cooling tower (CT) setpoints through a Gymnasium interface, with dynamic changes in workloads. This environment creates a multi-objective real-time optimization challenge balancing local thermal regulation and global energy efficiency, and also supports additional components like a heat recovery unit (HRU). We benchmark centralized and decentralized multi-agent RL approaches, demonstrate policy distillation into decision and regression trees for interpretable control, and explore LLM-based methods that explain control actions in natural language through an agentic mesh architecture designed to foster user trust and simplify system management. LC-Opt democratizes access to detailed, customizable liquid cooling models, enabling the ML community, operators, and vendors to develop sustainable data center liquid cooling control solutions.

Abstract: The increasing energy demands and carbon footprint of large-scale AI require intelligent workload management in globally distributed data centers. Yet progress is limited by the absence of benchmarks that realistically capture the interplay of time-varying environmental factors (grid carbon intensity, electricity prices, weather), detailed data center physics (CPUs, GPUs, memory, HVAC energy), and geo-distributed network dynamics (latency and transmission costs). To bridge this gap, we present DCcluster-Opt: an open-source, high-fidelity simulation benchmark for sustainable, geo-temporal task scheduling. DCcluster-Opt combines curated real-world datasets, including AI workload traces, grid carbon intensity, electricity markets, weather across 20 global regions, cloud transmission costs, and empirical network delay parameters with physics-informed models of data center operations, enabling rigorous and reproducible research in sustainable computing. It presents a challenging scheduling problem where a top-level coordinating agent must dynamically reassign or defer tasks that arrive with resource and service-level agreement requirements across a configurable cluster of data centers to optimize multiple objectives. The environment also models advanced components such as heat recovery. A modular reward system enables an explicit study of trade-offs among carbon emissions, energy costs, service level agreements, and water use. It provides a Gymnasium API with baseline controllers, including reinforcement learning and rule-based strategies, to support reproducible ML research and a fair comparison of diverse algorithms. By offering a realistic, configurable, and accessible testbed, DCcluster-Opt accelerates the development and validation of next-generation sustainable computing solutions for geo-distributed data centers.

Abstract: In modern engineering practice, human engineers collaborate in specialized teams to design complex products, with each expert completing their respective tasks while communicating and exchanging results and data with one another. While this division of expertise is essential for managing multidisciplinary complexity, it demands substantial development time and cost. Recently, we introduced OpenFOAMGPT (1.0, 2.0), which functions as an autonomous AI engineer for computational fluid dynamics, and turbulence.ai, which can conduct end-to-end research in fluid mechanics draft publications and PhD theses. Building upon these foundations, we present Engineering.ai, a platform for teams of AI engineers in computational design. The framework employs a hierarchical multi-agent architecture where a Chief Engineer coordinates specialized agents consisting of Aerodynamics, Structural, Acoustic, and Optimization Engineers, each powered by LLM with domain-specific knowledge. Agent-agent collaboration is achieved through file-mediated communication for data provenance and reproducibility, while a comprehensive memory system maintains project context, execution history, and retrieval-augmented domain knowledge to ensure reliable decision-making across the workflow. The system integrates FreeCAD, Gmsh, OpenFOAM, CalculiX, and BPM acoustic analysis, enabling parallel multidisciplinary simulations while maintaining computational accuracy. The framework is validated through UAV wing optimization. This work demonstrates that agentic-AI-enabled AI engineers has the potential to perform complex engineering tasks autonomously. Remarkably, the automated workflow achieved a 100% success rate across over 400 parametric configurations, with zero mesh generation failures, solver convergence issues, or manual interventions required, validating that the framework is trustworthy.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus remains one of the most compelling and challenging benchmarks for tracking progress toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence. In contrast to other evaluation datasets designed to assess an agent's task-specific skills or accumulated knowledge, the ARC-AGI suite is specifically targeted at measuring skill acquisition efficiency, a trait that has (so far) been lacking in even the most sophisticated machine learning systems. For algorithms that require extensive intra-task exemplars, a significant constraint imposed by ARC-AGI is the modest cardinality of its demonstration set, comprising a small number of $\langle$ input, output $\rangle$ grids per task specifying the corresponding transformation. To embellish the space of viable sample pairs, this paper introduces ARC-GEN, an open-source procedural generator aimed at extending the original ARC-AGI training dataset as faithfully as possible. Unlike prior efforts, our generator is both exhaustive (covering all four-hundred tasks) and mimetic (more closely honoring the distributional properties and characteristics embodied in the initial ARC-AGI-1 release). We also discuss the use of this generator in establishing a static benchmark suite to verify the correctness of programs submitted to the 2025 Google Code Golf Championship.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual compliance verification is a critical yet underexplored problem in computer vision, especially in domains such as media, entertainment, and advertising where content must adhere to complex and evolving policy rules. Existing methods often rely on task-specific deep learning models trained on manually labeled datasets, which are costly to build and limited in generalizability. While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) offer broad real-world knowledge and policy understanding, they struggle to reason over fine-grained visual details and apply structured compliance rules effectively on their own. In this paper, we propose CompAgent, the first agentic framework for visual compliance verification. CompAgent augments MLLMs with a suite of visual tools - such as object detectors, face analyzers, NSFW detectors, and captioning models - and introduces a planning agent that dynamically selects appropriate tools based on the compliance policy. A verification agent then integrates image, tool outputs, and policy context to perform multi-modal reasoning. Experiments on public benchmarks show that CompAgent outperforms specialized classifiers, direct MLLM prompting, and curated routing baselines, achieving up to 76% F1 score and a 10% improvement over the state-of-the-art on the UnsafeBench dataset. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of agentic planning and tool-augmented reasoning for scalable, accurate, and adaptable visual compliance verification.

<title>From Evidence to Verdict: An Agent-Based Forensic Framework for AI-Generated Image Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00181</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of AI-generated images poses unprecedented challenges to information integrity and media authenticity. Existing detection approaches suffer from fundamental limitations: traditional classifiers lack interpretability and fail to generalize across evolving generative models, while vision-language models (VLMs), despite their promise, remain constrained to single-shot analysis and pixel-level reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce AIFo (Agent-based Image Forensics), a novel training-free framework that emulates human forensic investigation through multi-agent collaboration. Unlike conventional methods, our framework employs a set of forensic tools, including reverse image search, metadata extraction, pre-trained classifiers, and VLM analysis, coordinated by specialized LLM-based agents that collect, synthesize, and reason over cross-source evidence. When evidence is conflicting or insufficient, a structured multi-agent debate mechanism allows agents to exchange arguments and reach a reliable conclusion. Furthermore, we enhance the framework with a memory-augmented reasoning module that learns from historical cases to improve future detection accuracy. Our comprehensive evaluation spans 6,000 images across both controlled laboratory settings and challenging real-world scenarios, including images from modern generative platforms and diverse online sources. AIFo achieves 97.05% accuracy, substantially outperforming traditional classifiers and state-of-the-art VLMs. These results demonstrate that agent-based procedural reasoning offers a new paradigm for more robust, interpretable, and adaptable AI-generated image detection.

Abstract: We study bicriteria versions of Makespan Minimization on Unrelated Machines and Santa Claus by allowing a constrained number of rejections. Given an instance of Makespan Minimization on Unrelated Machines where the optimal makespan for scheduling $n$ jobs on $m$ unrelated machines is $T$, (Feige and Vondr\'ak, 2006) gave an algorithm that schedules a $(1-1/e+10^{-180})$ fraction of jobs in time $T$. We show the ratio can be improved to $0.6533>1-1/e+0.02$ if we allow makespan $3T/2$. To the best our knowledge, this is the first result examining the tradeoff between makespan and the fraction of scheduled jobs when the makespan is not $T$ or $2T$.
  For the Santa Claus problem (the Max-Min version of Makespan Minimization), the analogous bicriteria objective was studied by (Golovin, 2005), who gave an algorithm providing an allocation so a $(1-1/k)$ fraction of agents receive value at least $T/k$, for any $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ and $T$ being the optimal minimum value every agent can receive. We provide the first hardness result by showing there are constants $\delta,\varepsilon>0$ such that it is NP-hard to find an allocation where a $(1-\delta)$ fraction of agents receive value at least $(1-\varepsilon) T$. To prove this hardness result, we introduce a bicriteria version of Set Packing, which may be of independent interest, and prove some algorithmic and hardness results for it. Overall, we believe these bicriteria scheduling problems warrant further study as they provide an interesting lens to understand how robust the difficulty of the original optimization goal might be.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents for complex software engineering tasks has created a need to understand their problem-solving behaviours beyond simple success metrics. While these agents demonstrate impressive capabilities in automated issue resolution, their decision-making processes remain largely opaque. This paper presents an empirical study of agent trajectories, namely the execution traces capturing the steps agents take when attempting to resolve software issues. We analyse trajectories from three state-of-the-art code agents (OpenHands, SWE-agent, and Prometheus) on the SWE-Bench benchmark, examining both successful and failed attempts. Our investigation reveals several key insights into agent behaviour. First, we identify how distinct problem-solving strategies, such as defensive programming and context gathering, enable success in different scenarios. Second, we find that failed trajectories are consistently longer and exhibit higher variance than successful ones, with failure patterns differing significantly between agents. Third, our fault localisation analysis shows that while most trajectories correctly identify problematic files (72-81\% even in failures), success depends more on achieving approximate rather than exact code modifications. These and other findings unveiled by our study, provide a foundation for understanding agent behaviour through trajectory analysis, contributing to the development of more robust and interpretable autonomous software engineering systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human users in interactive settings such as therapy, education, and social role-play. While these simulations enable scalable training and evaluation of AI agents, off-the-shelf LLMs often drift from their assigned personas, contradict earlier statements, or abandon role-appropriate behavior. We introduce a unified framework for evaluating and improving persona consistency in LLM-generated dialogue. We define three automatic metrics: prompt-to-line consistency, line-to-line consistency, and Q&amp;A consistency, that capture different types of persona drift and validate each against human annotations. Using these metrics as reward signals, we apply multi-turn reinforcement learning to fine-tune LLMs for three user roles: a patient, a student, and a social chat partner. Our method reduces inconsistency by over 55%, resulting in more coherent and faithful simulated users.

Abstract: Humans excel at visual social inference, the ability to infer hidden elements of a scene from subtle behavioral cues such as other people's gaze, pose, and orientation. This ability drives everyday social reasoning in humans and is critical for developing more human-like AI agents. We introduce Spot The Ball, a challenging benchmark for evaluating visual social inference in vision-language models (VLMs) using sports as a test domain. The task is to localize a removed sports ball from soccer, basketball, and volleyball images. We present a curated evaluation set with human baselines and a scalable pipeline for generating additional test items. We evaluate four state-of-the-art VLMs (Gemini, GPT, LLaMA, Qwen) using three prompting strategies, finding that humans are consistently two to three times more accurate (20-34%) than models ($\leq$ 17%) across all sports. Our analyses show that models rely on superficial spatial heuristics--such as guessing near the image center or nearby players--while humans leverage social cues like gaze direction and body pose. These findings reveal a persistent human-model gap in visual social reasoning and underscore the need for architectures that explicitly encode structured behavioral cues to achieve robust, human-like inference.

<title>AgentBnB: A Browser-Based Cybersecurity Tabletop Exercise with Large Language Model Support and Retrieval-Aligned Scaffolding</title>

Abstract: Traditional cybersecurity tabletop exercises (TTXs) provide valuable training but are often scripted, resource-intensive, and difficult to scale. We introduce AgentBnB, a browser-based re-imagining of the Backdoors & Breaches game that integrates large language model teammates with a Bloom-aligned, retrieval-augmented copilot (C2D2). The system expands a curated corpus into factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive snippets, delivering on-demand, cognitively targeted hints. Prompt-engineered agents employ a scaffolding ladder that gradually fades as learner confidence grows. In a solo-player pilot with four graduate students, participants reported greater intention to use the agent-based version compared to the physical card deck and viewed it as more scalable, though a ceiling effect emerged on a simple knowledge quiz. Despite limitations of small sample size, single-player focus, and narrow corpus, these early findings suggest that large language model augmented TTXs can provide lightweight, repeatable practice without the logistical burden of traditional exercises. Planned extensions include multi-player modes, telemetry-driven coaching, and comparative studies with larger cohorts.

<title>Improving the Robustness of Control of Chaotic Convective Flows with Domain-Informed Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00272</link>

Abstract: Chaotic convective flows arise in many real-world systems, such as microfluidic devices and chemical reactors. Stabilizing these flows is highly desirable but remains challenging, particularly in chaotic regimes where conventional control methods often fail. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise for control in laminar flow settings, but its ability to generalize and remain robust under chaotic and turbulent dynamics is not well explored, despite being critical for real-world deployment. In this work, we improve the practical feasibility of RL-based control of such flows focusing on Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection (RBC), a canonical model for convective heat transport. To enhance generalization and sample efficiency, we introduce domain-informed RL agents that are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization across diverse initial conditions and flow regimes. We incorporate domain knowledge in the reward function via a term that encourages B\'enard cell merging, as an example of a desirable macroscopic property. In laminar flow regimes, the domain-informed RL agents reduce convective heat transport by up to 33%, and in chaotic flow regimes, they still achieve a 10% reduction, which is significantly better than the conventional controllers used in practice. We compare the domain-informed to uninformed agents: Our results show that the domain-informed reward design results in steady flows, faster convergence during training, and generalization across flow regimes without retraining. Our work demonstrates that elegant domain-informed priors can greatly enhance the robustness of RL-based control of chaotic flows, bringing real-world deployment closer.

Abstract: Much ethical evaluation treats actions dyadically: one agent acts on one recipient. In networked, platform-mediated environments, this lens misses how public acts diffuse. We introduce a minimal message-passing model in which an initiating act with baseline valence w spreads across a social graph with exposure b, per-hop salience $alpha$, compliance $q$, and depth (horizon) d. The model yields a closed-form \emph{network multiplier} relative to the dyadic baseline and identifies a threshold at r=b.alpha.q=1 separating subcritical (saturating), critical (linear), and supercritical (geometric) regimes. We show how common platform design levers -- reach and fan-out (affecting b), ranking and context (affecting alpha), share mechanics and friction (affecting q), and time-bounds (affecting d) -- systematically change expected downstream responsibility Applications include pandemic mitigation and vaccination externalities, as well as platform amplification of prosocial and harmful norms.

<title>Sherlock: Reliable and Efficient Agentic Workflow Execution</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00330</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLM), agentic workflows, which compose multiple LLM calls with tools, retrieval, and reasoning steps, are increasingly replacing traditional applications. However, such workflows are inherently error-prone: incorrect or partially correct output at one step can propagate or even amplify through subsequent stages, compounding the impact on the final output. Recent work proposes integrating verifiers that validate LLM output or actions, such as self-reflection, debate, or LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms. Yet, verifying every step introduces significant latency and cost overheads.
  In this work, we seek to answer three key questions: which nodes in a workflow are most error-prone and thus deserve costly verification, how to select the most appropriate verifier for each node, and how to use verification with minimal impact to latency? Our solution, Sherlock, addresses these using counterfactual analysis on agentic workflows to identify error-prone nodes and selectively attaching cost-optimal verifiers only where necessary. At runtime, Sherlock speculatively executes downstream tasks to reduce latency overhead, while verification runs in the background. If verification fails, execution is rolled back to the last verified output. Compared to the non-verifying baseline, Sherlock delivers an 18.3% accuracy gain on average across benchmarks. Sherlock reduces workflow execution time by up to 48.7% over non-speculative execution and lowers verification cost by 26.0% compared to the Monte Carlo search-based method, demonstrating that principled, fault-aware verification effectively balances efficiency and reliability in agentic workflows.

<title>U-centrality: A Network Centrality Measure Based on Minimum Energy Control for Laplacian Dynamics</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00339</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network centrality is a foundational concept for quantifying the importance of nodes within a network. Many traditional centrality measures--such as degree and betweenness centrality--are purely structural and often overlook the dynamics that unfold across the network. However, the notion of a node's importance is inherently context-dependent and must reflect both the system's dynamics and the specific objectives guiding its operation. Motivated by this perspective, we propose a dynamic, task-aware centrality framework rooted in optimal control theory. By formulating a problem on minimum energy control of average opinion based on Laplacian dynamics and focusing on the variance of terminal state, we introduce a novel centrality measure--termed U-centrality--that quantifies a node's ability to unify the agents' state. We demonstrate that U-centrality interpolates between known measures: it aligns with degree centrality in the short-time horizon and converges to a new centrality over longer time scales which is closely related to current-flow closeness centrality. This work bridges structural and dynamical approaches to centrality, offering a principled, versatile tool for network analysis in dynamic environments.

<title>Who Can We Trust? Scope-Aware Video Moment Retrieval with Multi-Agent Conflict</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video moment retrieval uses a text query to locate a moment from a given untrimmed video reference. Locating corresponding video moments with text queries helps people interact with videos efficiently. Current solutions for this task have not considered conflict within location results from different models, so various models cannot integrate correctly to produce better results. This study introduces a reinforcement learning-based video moment retrieval model that can scan the whole video once to find the moment's boundary while producing its locational evidence. Moreover, we proposed a multi-agent system framework that can use evidential learning to resolve conflicts between agents' localization output. As a side product of observing and dealing with conflicts between agents, we can decide whether a query has no corresponding moment in a video (out-of-scope) without additional training, which is suitable for real-world applications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed methods compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, the results of our study reveal that modeling competition and conflict of the multi-agent system is an effective way to improve RL performance in moment retrieval and show the new role of evidential learning in the multi-agent framework.

<title>Tree Training: Accelerating Agentic LLMs Training via Shared Prefix Reuse</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00413</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In agentic LLM scenarios, an agent's interaction process during a single rollout often exhibits branching behaviors. Due to memory retrieval and concurrent tool executions at certain decision points, the token trajectory of one task evolves into a tree-like structure rather than a linear sequence. However, current training pipelines decompose such tree-structured trajectories into separate linear segments, treating each branch as an independent sequence. As a result, shared prefixes across these branches are repeatedly recomputed during both forward and backward passes. To address this inefficiency, we propose Tree Training, a paradigm that computes each shared prefix only once and reuses its intermediate results across related branches during both forward and backward passes, substantially improving computation efficiency in large-scale agentic training. This is achieved via (i) Tree Packing, which efficiently reuses shared computations across trajectories, and (ii) Gradient Restoration, which ensures correct gradient propagation across reused prefixes. Experiments on multiple open-source models demonstrate up to 3.9x reduction in total training time, enabling more efficient agentic LLM SFT and RL training.

<title>COHERE - Congestion-aware Offloading and Handover via Empirical RAT Evaluation for Multi-RAT Networks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00439</link>

Abstract: The evolution of wireless networks and radio access technologies (RATs) has transformed communication from user-driven traffic into a dynamic ecosystem of autonomous systems, including IoT devices, edge nodes, autonomous vehicles, AR/XR clients, and AI-powered agents. These systems exhibit diverse traffic patterns, latency requirements, and mobility behaviors, increasingly operating across overlapping heterogeneous RATs such as 5G, WiFi, satellite, NB-IoT, LoRaWAN, Zigbee, etc. This multi-RAT coexistence creates opportunities for intelligent access, mobility, and routing strategies. However, most mobility decisions still rely heavily on RSSI, which neglects RAT-specific features, congestion, queuing delays, and application needs, favoring high-power links over optimal ones. To address this gap, we propose chrome (Congestion-aware Offloading and Handover via Empirical RAT Evaluation), a multi criteria framework for dense multi-RAT networks. chrome enhances RSSI with multiple criteria and applies the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to rank available RATs. Criteria weights are determined using both subjective (operator-driven) and objective (measurement-based) approaches. Based on this ranking, chrome performs intelligent cross-RAT offloading to reduce congestion on over-utilized links. We evaluate chrome in a dense SDN-controlled 5G/WiFi Multi-RAT environment using Mininet WiFi. Compared to RSSI-only handover, COHERE reduces the load on the congested RAT by up to 32%, reduces total handovers by 25%, lowers handovers to the congested RAT by 55%, and improves link delay by up to 166%, while maintaining comparable or up to 11% higher throughput. These results demonstrate that guarded, multi-criteria decision-making can exploit RAT coexistence to deliver robust, congestion-aware performance across heterogeneous deployments.

Abstract: Context: The software maintenance phase involves many activities such as code refactoring, bug fixing, code review or testing. Program comprehension is key to all these activities, as it demands developers to grasp the knowledge (e.g., implementation details) required to modify the codebase. Methods as main building blocks in a program can offer developers this knowledge source for code comprehension. However, reading entire method statements can be challenging, which necessitates precise and up-to-date comments. Objective: We propose a solution as an IntelliJ IDEA plugin, named SmartDoc, that assists developers in generating context-aware method comments. Method: This plugin acts as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that has its own memory and is augmented by target methods' context. When a request is initiated by the end-user, the method content and all its nested method calls are used in the comment generation. At the beginning, these nested methods are visited and a call graph is generated. This graph is then traversed using depth-first search (DFS), enabling the provision of full-context to enrich Large Language Model (LLM) prompts. Result: The product is a software, as a plugin, developed for Java codebase and installable on IntelliJ IDEA. This plugin can serve concurrently for methods whose comments are being updated , and it shares memory across all flows to avoid redundant calls. o measure the accuracy of this solution, a dedicated test case is run to record SmartDoc generated comments and their corresponding ground truth. For each collected result-set, three metrics are computed, BERTScore, BLEU and ROUGE-1. These metrics will determine how accurate the generated comments are in comparison to the ground truth. Result: The obtained accuracy, in terms of the precision, recall and F1, is promising, and lies in the range of 0.80 to 0.90 for BERTScore.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code-related tasks. Despite their advancement, empirical evidence reveals that they still struggle with \emph{deductive code reasoning}, the ability to reason about the program execution process. While prior studies have recognized this limitation, the underlying causes remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we begin by presenting a comprehensive empirical study that reveals three key challenges undermining deductive code reasoning: (1) an intrinsic gap between generation and reasoning abilities, (2) a consistent bias towards code sources, and (3) weak zero-shot generalization on complex benchmarks. In light of these challenges, we propose \texttt{ReMind}, a multi-agent framework composed of \texttt{Mutator}, \texttt{Executor}, and \texttt{Inspector}. The \texttt{Mutator} generates code variants to mitigate bias towards code sources, the \texttt{Executor} traces variable states step-by-step to expose inconsistency, and the \texttt{Inspector} identifies problematic reasoning steps and provides control-flow refinement to bridge the intrinsic reasoning gap. Through their coordinated collaboration, \texttt{ReMind} systematically identifies and refines reasoning flaws, achieving outstanding performance and enabling robust zero-shot generalization. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks with five LLMs demonstrate the superior advantages of \texttt{ReMind} compared to baseline approaches in deductive code reasoning.

Abstract: Conversational agents are increasingly being explored to support healthcare delivery, particularly in resource-constrained settings such as rural Nepal. Large-scale conversational models typically rely on internet connectivity and cloud infrastructure, which may not be accessible in rural areas. In this study, we fine-tuned DialoGPT, a lightweight generative dialogue model that can operate offline, on a synthetically constructed dataset of doctor-patient interactions covering ten common diseases prevalent in rural Nepal, including common cold, seasonal fever, diarrhea, typhoid fever, gastritis, food poisoning, malaria, dengue fever, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. Despite being trained on a limited, domain-specific dataset, the fine-tuned model produced coherent, contextually relevant, and medically appropriate responses, demonstrating an understanding of symptoms, disease context, and empathetic communication. These results highlight the adaptability of compact, offline-capable dialogue models and the effectiveness of targeted datasets for domain adaptation in low-resource healthcare environments, offering promising directions for future rural medical conversational AI.

<title>Issue-Oriented Agent-Based Framework for Automated Review Comment Generation</title>

arXiv:2511.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code review (CR) is a crucial practice for ensuring software quality. Various automated review comment generation techniques have been proposed to streamline the labor-intensive process. However, existing approaches heavily rely on a single model to identify various issues within the code, limiting the model's ability to handle the diverse, issue-specific nature of code changes and leading to non-informative comments, especially in complex scenarios such as bug fixes. To address these limitations, we propose RevAgent, a novel agent-based issue-oriented framework, decomposes the task into three stages: (1) Generation Stage, where five category-specific commentator agents analyze code changes from distinct issue perspectives and generate candidate comments; (2) Discrimination Stage, where a critic agent selects the most appropriate issue-comment pair; and (3) Training Stage, where all agents are fine-tuned on curated, category-specific data to enhance task specialization. Evaluation results show that RevAgent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PLM- and LLM-based baselines, with improvements of 12.90\%, 10.87\%, 6.32\%, and 8.57\% on BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and SBERT, respectively. It also achieves relatively higher accuracy in issue-category identification, particularly for challenging scenarios. Human evaluations further validate the practicality of RevAgent in generating accurate, readable, and context-aware review comments. Moreover, RevAgent delivers a favorable trade-off between performance and efficiency.

<title>On Improvisation and Open-Endedness: Insights for Experiential AI</title>

Abstract: Improvisation-the art of spontaneous creation that unfolds moment-to-moment without a scripted outcome-requires practitioners to continuously sense, adapt, and create anew. It is a fundamental mode of human creativity spanning music, dance, and everyday life. The open-ended nature of improvisation produces a stream of novel, unrepeatable moments-an aspect highly valued in artistic creativity. In parallel, open-endedness (OE)-a system's capacity for unbounded novelty and endless "interestingness"-is exemplified in natural or cultural evolution and has been considered "the last grand challenge" in artificial life (ALife). The rise of generative AI now raises the question in computational creativity (CC) research: What makes a "good" improvisation for AI? Can AI learn to improvise in a genuinely open-ended way? In this work-in-progress paper, we report insights from in-depth interviews with 6 experts in improvisation across dance, music, and contact improvisation. We draw systemic connections between human improvisational arts and the design of future experiential AI agents that could improvise alone or alongside humans-or even with other AI agents-embodying qualities of improvisation drawn from practice: active listening (umwelt and awareness), being in the time (mindfulness and ephemerality), embracing the unknown (source of randomness and serendipity), non-judgmental flow (acceptance and dynamical stability, balancing structure and surprise (unpredictable criticality at edge of chaos), imaginative metaphor (synaesthesia and planning), empathy, trust, boundary, and care (mutual theory of mind), and playfulness and intrinsic motivation (maintaining interestingness).

<title>Robust Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control Under Demand Fluctuations</title>

Abstract: Traffic congestion, primarily driven by intersection queuing, significantly impacts urban living standards, safety, environmental quality, and economic efficiency. While Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems hold potential for congestion mitigation, traditional optimization models often fail to capture real-world traffic complexity and dynamics. This study introduces a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for regional adaptive TSC, circumventing the coordination complexities inherent in multi-agent systems through a centralized decision-making paradigm. The model employs an adjacency matrix to unify the encoding of road network topology, real-time queue states derived from probe vehicle data, and current signal timing parameters. Leveraging the efficient learning capabilities of the DreamerV3 world model, the agent learns control policies where actions sequentially select intersections and adjust their signal phase splits to regulate traffic inflow/outflow, analogous to a feedback control system. Reward design prioritizes queue dissipation, directly linking congestion metrics (queue length) to control actions. Simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate the model's effectiveness: under inference scenarios with multi-level (10%, 20%, 30%) Origin-Destination (OD) demand fluctuations, the framework exhibits robust anti-fluctuation capability and significantly reduces queue lengths. This work establishes a new paradigm for intelligent traffic control compatible with probe vehicle technology. Future research will focus on enhancing practical applicability by incorporating stochastic OD demand fluctuations during training and exploring regional optimization mechanisms for contingency events.

Abstract: Several studies have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of regional adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) and achieved promising results. In this field, existing research predominantly adopts multi-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks presents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC) problem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on centralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic conditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all intersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model compatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design include state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning and manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on queue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length definition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions but is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows for reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With probe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the proposed method's potential for widespread deployment. The method was comprehensively evaluated using the SUMO simulation platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively mitigates large-scale regional congestion levels via coordinated multi-intersection control.

Abstract: Understanding probabilistic relationships among variables is crucial for analyzing complex systems. Traditional structure learning methods often require extensive observational data and incur high computational costs. Recent studies have explored using large language models (LLMs) for structure learning, but most treat LLMs as auxiliary tools for pre-processing or post-processing, leaving the core learning process data-driven. In this work, we propose a unified framework for Bayesian network structure discovery that places LLMs at the center, supporting both data-free and data-aware settings. In the data-free case, we introduce \textbf{PromptBN} to query LLMs with metadata and efficiently uncover valid probabilistic relationships. When observational data are available, we introduce \textbf{ReActBN}, which integrates the ReAct reasoning paradigm with structure scores such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for iterative refinement. Unlike prior methods that offload refinement to external algorithms, our framework maintains the LLM actively in the loop throughout the discovery process. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both existing LLM-based approaches and traditional data-driven algorithms, particularly in the low- or no-data scenario. Code is publicly available at {\texttt{\textcolor{magenta}{https://github.com/sherryzyh/prompt2bn}}}.

Abstract: Automatic code optimization remains a difficult challenge, particularly for complex loop nests on modern hardware. This paper investigates a novel approach to code optimization where Large Language Models (LLMs) guide the process through a closed-loop interaction with a compiler. We present ComPilot, an experimental framework that leverages off-the-shelf LLMs, without any task-specific fine-tuning, as interactive optimization agents. ComPilot establishes a feedback loop where an LLM proposes transformations for a given loop nest to a compiler. The compiler attempts the transformations, reporting back legality status and measured speedup or slowdown. The LLM utilizes this concrete feedback to iteratively refine its optimization strategy. Our extensive evaluation across the PolyBench benchmark suite demonstrates the effectiveness of this zero-shot approach. ComPilot achieves geometric mean speedups of 2.66x (single run) and 3.54x (best-of-5 runs) over the original code. Furthermore, ComPilot demonstrates competitive performance against the state-of-the-art Pluto polyhedral optimizer, outperforming it in many cases. This experimental study demonstrates that general-purpose LLMs can effectively guide the code optimization process when grounded by compiler feedback, opening promising research directions for agentic AI in code optimization.

Abstract: Automating the detection of EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) violations in source code is a critical but underexplored challenge. We introduce \textbf{GDPR-Bench-Android}, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating diverse automated methods for GDPR compliance detection in Android applications. It contains \textbf{1951} manually annotated violation instances from \textbf{15} open-source repositories, covering 23 GDPR articles at file-, module-, and line-level granularities. To enable a multi-paradigm evaluation, we contribute \textbf{Formal-AST}, a novel, source-code-native formal method that serves as a deterministic baseline. We define two tasks: (1) \emph{multi-granularity violation localization}, evaluated via Accuracy@\textit{k}; and (2) \emph{snippet-level multi-label classification}, assessed by macro-F1 and other classification metrics. We benchmark 11 methods, including eight state-of-the-art LLMs, our Formal-AST analyzer, a retrieval-augmented (RAG) method, and an agentic (ReAct) method. Our findings reveal that no single paradigm excels across all tasks. For Task 1, the ReAct agent achieves the highest file-level Accuracy@1 (17.38%), while the Qwen2.5-72B LLM leads at the line level (61.60%), in stark contrast to the Formal-AST method's 1.86%. For the difficult multi-label Task 2, the Claude-Sonnet-4.5 LLM achieves the best Macro-F1 (5.75%), while the RAG method yields the highest Macro-Precision (7.10%). These results highlight the task-dependent strengths of different automated approaches and underscore the value of our benchmark in diagnosing their capabilities.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), LLM-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) are drawing increasing interest across academia and industry. However, many current MAS frameworks struggle with reliability and scalability, especially on complex tasks. We present AgentGit, a framework that brings Git-like rollback and branching to MAS workflows. Built as an infrastructure layer on top of LangGraph, AgentGit supports state commit, revert, and branching, allowing agents to traverse, compare, and explore multiple trajectories efficiently. To evaluate AgentGit, we designed an experiment that optimizes target agents by selecting better prompts. We ran a multi-step A/B test against three baselines -- LangGraph, AutoGen, and Agno -- on a real-world task: retrieving and analyzing paper abstracts. Results show that AgentGit significantly reduces redundant computation, lowers runtime and token usage, and supports parallel exploration across multiple branches, enhancing both reliability and scalability in MAS development. This work offers a practical path to more robust MAS design and enables error recovery, safe exploration, iterative debugging, and A/B testing in collaborative AI systems.

<title>Leveraging Multi-Agent System (MAS) and Fine-Tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) for Automated Telecom Network Troubleshooting</title>

Abstract: Telecom networks are rapidly growing in scale and complexity, making effective management, operation, and optimization increasingly challenging. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been applied to many telecom tasks, existing models are often narrow in scope, require large amounts of labeled data, and struggle to generalize across heterogeneous deployments. Consequently, network troubleshooting continues to rely heavily on Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to manually correlate various data sources to identify root causes and corrective actions. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Agent System (MAS) that employs an agentic workflow, with Large Language Models (LLMs) coordinating multiple specialized tools for fully automated network troubleshooting. Once faults are detected by AI/ML-based monitors, the framework dynamically activates agents such as an orchestrator, solution planner, executor, data retriever, and root-cause analyzer to diagnose issues and recommend remediation strategies within a short time frame. A key component of this system is the solution planner, which generates appropriate remediation plans based on internal documentation. To enable this, we fine-tuned a Small Language Model (SLM) on proprietary troubleshooting documents to produce domain-grounded solution plans. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly accelerates troubleshooting automation across both Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core network domains.

<title>Measuring Machine Companionship: Scale Development and Validation for AI Companions</title>

Abstract: The mainstreaming of companionable machines--customizable artificial agents designed to participate in ongoing, idiosyncratic, socioemotional relationships--is met with relative theoretical and empirical disarray, according to recent systematic reviews. In particular, the conceptualization and measurement of machine companionship (MC) is inconsistent or sometimes altogether missing. This study starts to bridge that gap by developing and initially validating a novel measurement to capture MC experiences--the unfolding, autotelic, positively experienced, coordinated connection between human and machine--with AI companions (AICs). After systematic generation and expert review of an item pool (including items pertaining to dyadism, coordination, autotelicity, temporality, and positive valence), N = 467 people interacting with AICs responded to the item pool and to construct validation measures. Through exploratory factor analysis, two factors were induced: Eudaimonic Exchange and Connective Coordination. Construct validation analyses (confirmed in a second sample; N = 249) indicate the factors function largely as expected. Post-hoc analyses of deviations suggest two different templates for MC with AICs: One socioinstrumental and one autotelic.

<title>Unveiling Uniform Shifted Power Law in Stochastic Human and Autonomous Driving Behavior</title>

Abstract: Accurately simulating rare but safety-critical driving behaviors is essential for the evaluation and certification of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, current models often fail to reproduce realistic collision rates when calibrated on real-world data, largely due to inadequate representation of long-tailed behavioral distributions. Here, we uncover a simple yet unifying shifted power law that robustly characterizes the stochasticity of both human-driven vehicle (HV) and AV behaviors, especially in the long-tail regime. The model adopts a parsimonious analytical form with only one or two parameters, enabling efficient calibration even under data sparsity. Analyzing large-scale, micro-level trajectory data from global HV and AV datasets, the shifted power law achieves an average R2 of 0.97 and a nearly identical tail distribution, uniformly fits both frequent behaviors and rare safety-critical deviations, significantly outperforming existing Gaussian-based baselines. When integrated into an agent-based traffic simulator, it enables forward-rolling simulations that reproduce realistic crash patterns for both HVs and AVs, achieving rates consistent with real-world statistics and improving the fidelity of safety assessment without post hoc correction. This discovery offers a unified and data-efficient foundation for modeling high-risk behavior and improves the fidelity of simulation-based safety assessments for mixed AV/HV traffic. The shifted power law provides a promising path toward simulation-driven validation and global certification of AV technologies.

<title>A CPU-Centric Perspective on Agentic AI</title>

Abstract: Agentic AI frameworks add a decision-making orchestrator embedded with external tools, including web search, Python interpreter, contextual database, and others, on top of monolithic LLMs, turning them from passive text oracles into autonomous problem-solvers that can plan, call tools, remember past steps, and adapt on the fly.
  This paper aims to characterize and understand the system bottlenecks introduced by agentic AI workloads from a largely overlooked CPU-centric perspective. We first systematically characterize Agentic AI on the basis of orchestrator/decision making component, inference path dynamics and repetitiveness of the agentic flow which directly influences the system-level performance. Thereafter, based on the characterization, we choose five representative agentic AI workloads- Haystack RAG, Toolformer, ChemCrow, Langchain and SWE-Agent to profile latency, throughput and energy metrics and demystify the significant impact of CPUs on these metrics relative to GPUs. We observe that - 1. Tool processing on CPUs can take up to 90.6% of the total latency; 2. Agentic throughput gets bottlenecked either by CPU factors - coherence, synchronization and over-subscription of cores or GPU factors - main memory capacity and bandwidth; \circled{3} CPU dynamic energy consumes up to 44% of the total dynamic energy at large batch sizes. Based on the profiling insights, we present two key optimizations- 1. CPU and GPU-Aware Micro-batching (CGAM) and 2. Mixed Agentic Workload Scheduling (MAWS) for homogeneous and heterogeneous agentic workloads respectively to demonstrate the potential to improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of agentic AI. We achieve up to 2.1x and 1.41x P50 latency speedup compared to the multi-processing benchmark for homogeneous and heterogeneous agentic workloads respectively.

<title>Count-Based Approaches Remain Strong: A Benchmark Against Transformer and LLM Pipelines on Structured EHR</title>

Abstract: Structured electronic health records (EHR) are essential for clinical prediction. While count-based learners continue to perform strongly on such data, no benchmarking has directly compared them against more recent mixture-of-agents LLM pipelines, which have been reported to outperform single LLMs in various NLP tasks. In this study, we evaluated three categories of methodologies for EHR prediction using the EHRSHOT dataset: count-based models built from ontology roll-ups with two time bins, based on LightGBM and the tabular foundation model TabPFN; a pretrained sequential transformer (CLMBR); and a mixture-of-agents pipeline that converts tabular histories to natural-language summaries followed by a text classifier. We assessed eight outcomes using the EHRSHOT dataset. Across the eight evaluation tasks, head-to-head wins were largely split between the count-based and the mixture-of-agents methods. Given their simplicity and interpretability, count-based models remain a strong candidate for structured EHR benchmarking.

Abstract: With the software industry shifting toward a data-driven culture, online A/B testing is a key tool for evaluating new technologies. However, deploying such experiments requires substantial resources, may negatively impact users, and involves long data collection periods. To address this, \textit{off-policy evaluation (OPE)}, or offline A/B testing, uses logged data to assess technologies and is fundamental in Reinforcement Learning, making it crucial in domains where online testing is costly or risky, such as healthcare, recommender systems, education, dialog systems, and robotics. Despite advances in coding LLMs and agentic AI, little is known about leveraging them to optimize OPE results. We investigate whether LLMs and LLM-based agents can improve OPE performance via code optimization. We propose \textit{GrowthHacker}, a benchmark with agent and baseline methods on large-scale real-world datasets, which iteratively optimizes code, evaluates results, and begins new optimization cycles. We collected datasets, established protocols, implemented baselines for OPE on the Open Bandit Pipeline (OBP)~\cite{saito2021openbanditdatasetpipeline} and Scope-RL~\cite{kiyohara2023scope}, and developed the \textit{two_agent} framework, which reduces system complexity while preserving optimization effectiveness. Results show the two_agent framework achieves 100% reliability and the highest average improvement of 106.7% among positive outcomes. Both two_agent and CrewAI reach 45% success rates, outperforming AutoGen's 34%. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of LLM-based agents as automated "growth hackers" to enhance OPE systems, with implications for scaling data-driven decision-making in production.

arXiv:2511.00807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-increasing computation and energy demand for LLM and AI agents call for holistic and efficient optimization of LLM serving systems. In practice, heterogeneous GPU clusters can be deployed in a geographically distributed manner, while LLM load also observes diversity in terms of both query traffic and serving patterns. LLM queries running on advanced GPUs during a high-emission hour at one location can lead to significantly higher carbon footprints versus same queries running on mid-level GPUs at a low-emission time and location. By observing LLM serving requirements and leveraging spatiotemporal computation flexibility, we consider the joint routing and scheduling problem, and propose FREESH to cooperatively run a group of data centers while minimizing user-specified carbon or energy objectives. FREESH identifies the optimal configurations of balanced load serving by matching distinct GPU instance's power-throughput characteristics with predictable LLM query length and workloads. To ensure both latency and fairness requirements, FREESH identifies optimized parallelism and query routing schedules together with dynamic GPU frequency scaling for power saving, and Least-Laxity-First (LLF) serving strategy for query scheduling. During the 1-hour serving on production workloads, FREESH reduces energy by 28.6% and emissions by 45.45% together with improvements in SLO attainment and fairness.

<title>GUI-AIMA: Aligning Intrinsic Multimodal Attention with a Context Anchor for GUI Grounding</title>

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a key function of computer-use agents, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable screen regions. Existing approaches based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically formulate it as a text-based coordinate generation task, yet directly generating precise coordinates from visual inputs remains challenging and computationally intensive. An intuitive way to implement GUI grounding is to first select visual patches relevant to the instructions and then determine the precise click location within those patches. Based on the observations that general MLLMs have some native grounding capability, nested within their attentions, we propose GUI-AIMA, an attention-based and coordinate-free supervised fine-tuning framework for efficient GUI grounding. GUI-AIMA aligns the intrinsic multimodal attention of MLLMs with patch-wise grounding signals. These signals are calculated adaptively for diverse user instructions by multi-head aggregation on simplified query-visual attention matrices. Besides, its coordinate-free manner can easily integrate a plug-and-play zoom-in stage. GUI-AIMA-3B was trained with only 85k screenshots, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency and verifying that light training can trigger the native grounding capability of MLLMs. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among 3B models, attaining an average accuracy of 58.6% on ScreenSpot-Pro and 62.2% on OSWorld-G.

Abstract: Autonomous systems often must predict the motions of nearby agents from partial and noisy data. This paper asks and answers the question: "can we learn, in real-time, a nonlinear predictive model of another agent's motions?" Our online framework denoises and forecasts such dynamics using a modified sliding-window Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (Hankel-DMD). Partial noisy measurements are embedded into a Hankel matrix, while an associated Page matrix enables singular-value hard thresholding (SVHT) to estimate the effective rank. A Cadzow projection enforces structured low-rank consistency, yielding a denoised trajectory and local noise variance estimates. From this representation, a time-varying Hankel-DMD lifted linear predictor is constructed for multi-step forecasts. The residual analysis provides variance-tracking signals that can support downstream estimators and risk-aware planning. We validate the approach in simulation under Gaussian and heavy-tailed noise, and experimentally on a dynamic crane testbed. Results show that the method achieves stable variance-aware denoising and short-horizon prediction suitable for integration into real-time control frameworks.

Abstract: We investigate optimal social welfare allocations of $m$ items to $n$ agents with binary additive or submodular valuations. For binary additive valuations, we prove that the set of optimal allocations coincides with the set of so-called \emph{stable allocations}, as long as the employed criterion for evaluating social welfare is strongly Pigou-Dalton (SPD) and symmetric. Many common criteria are SPD and symmetric, such as Nash social welfare, leximax, leximin, Gini index, entropy, and envy sum. We also design efficient algorithms for finding a stable allocation, including an $O(m^2n)$ time algorithm for the case of indivisible items, and an $O(m^2n^5)$ time one for the case of divisible items. The first is faster than the existing algorithms or has a simpler analysis. The latter is the first combinatorial algorithm for that problem. It utilizes a hidden layer partition of items and agents admitted by all stable allocations, and cleverly reduces the case of divisible items to the case of indivisible items.
  In addition, we show that the profiles of different optimal allocations have a small Chebyshev distance, which is 0 for the case of divisible items under binary additive valuations, and is at most 1 for the case of indivisible items under binary submodular valuations.

Abstract: Current benchmarks for coding evaluate language models (LMs) on concrete, well-specified tasks such as fixing specific bugs or writing targeted tests. However, human programmers do not spend all day incessantly addressing isolated tasks. Instead, real-world software development is grounded in the pursuit of high-level goals, like improving user retention or reducing costs. Evaluating whether LMs can also iteratively develop code to better accomplish open-ended objectives without any explicit guidance remains an open challenge. To address this, we introduce CodeClash, a benchmark where LMs compete in multi-round tournaments to build the best codebase for achieving a competitive objective. Each round proceeds in two phases: agents edit their code, then their codebases compete head-to-head in a code arena that determines winners based on objectives like score maximization, resource acquisition, or survival. Whether it's writing notes, scrutinizing documentation, analyzing competition logs, or creating test suites, models must decide for themselves how to improve their codebases both absolutely and against their opponents. We run 1680 tournaments (25,200 rounds total) to evaluate 8 LMs across 6 arenas. Our results reveal that while models exhibit diverse development styles, they share fundamental limitations in strategic reasoning. Models also struggle with long-term codebase maintenance, as repositories become progressively messy and redundant. These limitations are stark: top models lose every round against expert human programmers. We open-source CodeClash to advance the study of autonomous, goal-oriented code development.

<title>Portal UX Agent - A Plug-and-Play Engine for Rendering UIs from Natural Language Specifications</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid appearance of large language models (LLMs) has led to systems that turn natural-language intent into real user interfaces (UIs). Free-form code generation maximizes expressiveness but often hurts reliability, security, and design-system compliance. In contrast, fully static UIs are easy to govern but lack adaptability. We present the Portal UX Agent, a practical middle way that makes bounded generation work: an LLM plans the UI at a high level, and a deterministic renderer assembles the final interface from a vetted set of components and layout templates. The agent maps intents to a typed composition-template and component specifications-constrained by a schema. This enables auditability, reuse, and safety while preserving flexibility. We also introduce a mixed-methods evaluation framework that combines automatic checks (coverage, property fidelity, layout, accessibility, performance) with an LLM-as-a-Judge rubric to assess semantic alignment and visual polish. Experiments on multi-domain portal scenarios show that the Portal UX Agent reliably turns intent into coherent, usable UIs and performs well on compositionality and clarity. This work advances agentic UI design by combining model-driven representations, plug-and-play rendering, and structured evaluation, paving the way for controllable and trustworthy UI generation.

Abstract: Unlike traditional automation tools or static LLM-based systems, agents combine decision-making and tool utilization to accomplish complex tasks, showing great potential in software engineering. However, existing studies largely focus on specific tasks or isolated aspects, providing an incomplete picture of agents' practical capabilities. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating seven general-purpose agent frameworks across three representative code-centric tasks: software development, vulnerability detection, and program repair. Each task is assessed using standard, widely adopted benchmarks to ensure objective and comparable evaluation. Agent performance is systematically analyzed from three complementary perspectives: effectiveness (task success), efficiency (execution process), and overhead (token consumption). Our findings reveal distinct capability patterns and trade-offs among the evaluated frameworks. In terms of effectiveness, agents achieve moderate overall performance. Regarding efficiency, AgentOrchestra tends to exhibit the longest trajectories and the most correction attempts due to coordination overhead, whereas OpenHands demonstrate stronger reflective reasoning abilities. For overhead, software development incurs the highest monetary cost, while GPTswarm remains the most cost-efficient. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth cross-analysis of the relationship between effectiveness and efficiency, exploring the underlying reasons behind their interplay. These findings guide both practical adoption and future research toward more efficient software engineering agents.

arXiv:2511.00880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose KFCPO, a novel Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) algorithm that combines scalable Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) based second-order policy optimization with safety-aware gradient manipulation. KFCPO leverages K-FAC to perform efficient and stable natural gradient updates by approximating the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) in a layerwise, closed form manner, avoiding iterative approximation overheads. To address the tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction, we introduce a margin aware gradient manipulation mechanism that adaptively adjusts the influence of reward and cost gradients based on the agent's proximity to safety boundaries. This method blends gradients using a direction sensitive projection, eliminating harmful interference and avoiding abrupt changes caused by fixed hard thresholds. Additionally, a minibatch level KL rollback strategy is adopted to ensure trust region compliance and to prevent destabilizing policy shifts. Experiments on Safety Gymnasium using OmniSafe show that KFCPO achieves 10.3% to 50.2% higher average return across environments compared to the best baseline that respected the safety constraint, demonstrating superior balance of safety and performance.

Abstract: Traditionally, an agent's beliefs would come from what the agent can see, hear, or sense. In the modern world, beliefs are often based on the data available to the agents. In this work, we investigate a dynamic logic of such beliefs that incorporates public announcements of data. The main technical contribution is a sound and complete axiomatisation of the interplay between data-informed beliefs and data announcement modalities. We also describe a non-trivial polynomial model checking algorithm for this logical system.

Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) enable direct location reasoning from image content, yet individual models struggle with diverse geographic regions and complex scenes. Existing multi-agent systems improve performance through model collaboration but treat all agent interactions uniformly. They lack mechanisms to handle conflicting predictions effectively. We propose \textbf{GraphGeo}, a multi-agent debate framework using heterogeneous graph neural networks for visual geo-localization. Our approach models diverse debate relationships through typed edges, distinguishing supportive collaboration, competitive argumentation, and knowledge transfer. We introduce a dual-level debate mechanism combining node-level refinement and edge-level argumentation modeling. A cross-level topology refinement strategy enables co-evolution between graph structure and agent representations. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate GraphGeo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our framework transforms cognitive conflicts between agents into enhanced geo-localization accuracy through structured debate.

Abstract: Today's best-explored routes towards generalist robots center on collecting ever larger "observations-in actions-out" robotics datasets to train large end-to-end models, copying a recipe that has worked for vision-language models (VLMs). We pursue a road less traveled: building generalist policies directly around VLMs by augmenting their general capabilities with specific robot capabilities encapsulated in a carefully curated set of perception, planning, and control modules. In Maestro, a VLM coding agent dynamically composes these modules into a programmatic policy for the current task and scenario. Maestro's architecture benefits from a streamlined closed-loop interface without many manually imposed structural constraints, and a comprehensive and diverse tool repertoire. As a result, it largely surpasses today's VLA models for zero-shot performance on challenging manipulation skills. Further, Maestro is easily extensible to incorporate new modules, easily editable to suit new embodiments such as a quadruped-mounted arm, and even easily adapts from minimal real-world experiences through local code edits.

Abstract: Effective modeling of how human travelers learn and adjust their travel behavior from interacting with transportation systems is critical for system assessment and planning. However, this task is also difficult due to the complex cognition and decision-making involved in such behavior. Recent research has begun to leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents for this task. Building on this, we introduce a novel dual-agent framework that enables continuous learning and alignment between LLM agents and human travelers on learning and adaptation behavior from online data streams. Our approach involves a set of LLM traveler agents, equipped with a memory system and a learnable persona, which serve as simulators for human travelers. To ensure behavioral alignment, we introduce an LLM calibration agent that leverages the reasoning and analytical capabilities of LLMs to train the personas of these traveler agents. Working together, this dual-agent system is designed to track and align the underlying decision-making mechanisms of travelers and produce realistic, adaptive simulations. Using a real-world dataset from a day-to-day route choice experiment, we show our approach significantly outperforms existing LLM-based methods in both individual behavioral alignment and aggregate simulation accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method moves beyond simple behavioral mimicry to capture the evolution of underlying learning processes, a deeper alignment that fosters robust generalization. Overall, our framework provides a new approach for creating adaptive and behaviorally realistic agents to simulate travelers' learning and adaptation that can benefit transportation simulation and policy analysis.

Abstract: Recently, effective coordination in embodied multi-agent systems has remained a fundamental challenge, particularly in scenarios where agents must balance individual perspectives with global environmental awareness. Existing approaches often struggle to balance fine-grained local control with comprehensive scene understanding, resulting in limited scalability and compromised collaboration quality. In this paper, we present GauDP, a novel Gaussian-image synergistic representation that facilitates scalable, perception-aware imitation learning in multi-agent collaborative systems. Specifically, GauDP constructs a globally consistent 3D Gaussian field from decentralized RGB observations, then dynamically redistributes 3D Gaussian attributes to each agent's local perspective. This enables all agents to adaptively query task-critical features from the shared scene representation while maintaining their individual viewpoints. This design facilitates both fine-grained control and globally coherent behavior without requiring additional sensing modalities (e.g., 3D point cloud). We evaluate GauDP on the RoboFactory benchmark, which includes diverse multi-arm manipulation tasks. Our method achieves superior performance over existing image-based methods and approaches the effectiveness of point-cloud-driven methods, while maintaining strong scalability as the number of agents increases.

Abstract: Translating natural language to SQL remains difficult for complex queries. Such queries often need environmental interaction and self-correction. To address this, we introduce MARS-SQL, a novel multi-agent framework that combines principled task decomposition and interactive reinforcement learning (RL). Our system comprises three specialized agents: a Grounding Agent for schema linking, a Generation Agent for query generation, and a Validation Agent for final selection. The core of our framework is the Generation agent, which is trained via a multi-turn RL policy. Adopting a ReAct-style Think-Act-Observe loop, the agent iteratively generates thoughts, executes SQL actions against a live database, and revises its strategy based on execution feedback, enabling dynamic, stateful reasoning and self-correction. At inference time, we generate multiple interaction trajectories to explore diverse reasoning paths. The Validation agent, then selects the optimal trajectory by modeling verification as a next-token prediction task and choosing the solution with the highest generation probability. This structured workflow pipelines specialized agents. It combines interactive RL for generation with generative modeling for verification. The approach proves highly effective for robust and accurate SQL generation. Experiments show that MARS-SQL achieves state-of-the-art Execution Accuracy of 77.84% on the BIRD dev set and 89.75% on the Spider test set. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangHaolin0526/MARS-SQL.

Abstract: The recent surge in AI agents that autonomously communicate, collaborate with humans and use diverse tools has unlocked promising opportunities in various real-world settings. However, a vital aspect remains underexplored: how agents handle data. Scalable autonomy demands agents that continuously acquire, process, and evolve their data. In this paper, we argue that data-savvy capabilities should be a top priority in the design of agentic systems to ensure reliable real-world deployment. Specifically, we propose four key capabilities to realize this vision: (1) Proactive data acquisition: enabling agents to autonomously gather task-critical knowledge or solicit human input to address data gaps; (2) Sophisticated data processing: requiring context-aware and flexible handling of diverse data challenges and inputs; (3) Interactive test data synthesis: shifting from static benchmarks to dynamically generated interactive test data for agent evaluation; and (4) Continual adaptation: empowering agents to iteratively refine their data and background knowledge to adapt to shifting environments. While current agent research predominantly emphasizes reasoning, we hope to inspire a reflection on the role of data-savvy agents as the next frontier in data-centric AI.

<title>HAFixAgent: History-Aware Automated Program Repair Agent</title>

Abstract: Automated program repair (APR) has recently shifted toward large language models and agent-based systems, yet most systems rely on local snapshot context, overlooking repository history. Prior work shows that repository history helps repair single-line bugs, since the last commit touching the buggy line is often the bug-introducing one. In this paper, we investigate whether repository history can also improve agentic APR systems at scale, especially for complex multi-hunk bugs. We present HAFixAgent, a History-Aware Bug-Fixing Agent that injects blame-derived repository heuristics into its repair loop. A preliminary study of all 854 real-world bugs from Defects4J motivates our design, showing that bug-relevant history is both widely available and highly concentrated. Empirical comparison of HAFixAgent with two state-of-the-art baselines shows: (1) Effectiveness: HAFixAgent significantly improves over the agent-based baseline (by 212.3%) and the multi-hunk baseline (by 29.9%). (2) Efficiency: history does not significantly increase agent steps and keeps token costs comparable, with notably lower median costs for complex multi-file-multi-hunk bugs. (3) Practicality: combining different historical heuristics repairs more bugs, offering a clear cost-benefit trade-off. HAFixAgent offers a practical recipe for history-aware agentic APR: ground the agent in version control history, prioritize diff-based historical context, and integrate complementary heuristics when needed.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.01078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in partially observable environments depends on effectively aggregating information from observations, communications, and reward signals. While most existing multi-agent systems primarily rely on rewards as the only feedback for policy training, our research shows that introducing auxiliary predictive tasks can significantly enhance learning efficiency and stability. We propose Belief-based Predictive Auxiliary Learning (BEPAL), a framework that incorporates auxiliary training objectives to support policy optimization. BEPAL follows the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm. Each agent learns a belief model that predicts unobservable state information, such as other agents' rewards or motion directions, alongside its policy model. By enriching hidden state representations with information that does not directly contribute to immediate reward maximization, this auxiliary learning process stabilizes MARL training and improves overall performance. We evaluate BEPAL in the predator-prey environment and Google Research Football, where it achieves an average improvement of about 16 percent in performance metrics and demonstrates more stable convergence compared to baseline methods.

<title>Deployable Vision-driven UAV River Navigation via Human-in-the-loop Preference Alignment</title>

Abstract: Rivers are critical corridors for environmental monitoring and disaster response, where Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) guided by vision-driven policies can provide fast, low-cost coverage. However, deployment exposes simulation-trained policies with distribution shift and safety risks and requires efficient adaptation from limited human interventions. We study human-in-the-loop (HITL) learning with a conservative overseer who vetoes unsafe or inefficient actions and provides statewise preferences by comparing the agent's proposal with a corrective override. We introduce Statewise Hybrid Preference Alignment for Robotics (SPAR-H), which fuses direct preference optimization on policy logits with a reward-based pathway that trains an immediate-reward estimator from the same preferences and updates the policy using a trust-region surrogate. With five HITL rollouts collected from a fixed novice policy, SPAR-H achieves the highest final episodic reward and the lowest variance across initial conditions among tested methods. The learned reward model aligns with human-preferred actions and elevates nearby non-intervened choices, supporting stable propagation of improvements. We benchmark SPAR-H against imitation learning (IL), direct preference variants, and evaluative reinforcement learning (RL) in the HITL setting, and demonstrate real-world feasibility of continual preference alignment for UAV river following. Overall, dual statewise preferences empirically provide a practical route to data-efficient online adaptation in riverine navigation.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) methods have traditionally focused on mitigating catastrophic forgetting through gradient-based retraining, an approach ill-suited for deployed agents that must adapt in real time. We introduce our Adaptive Teaching and Learning System (ATLAS), a dual-agent architecture that decouples reasoning (Teacher) from execution (Student) and incorporates a persistent learning memory that stores distilled guidance from experience. This informs the orchestration layer, enabling the system to dynamically adjust its operational strategies, such as supervision level or initial plan selection, at inference time. In doing so, ATLAS achieves gradient-free continual learning, shifting the locus of adaptation from model parameters to system-level orchestration. We formulate this as a system-centric paradigm for continual learning, where the objective is adaptive efficiency: maximizing task success while minimizing computational cost through inference-time orchestration rather than parameter updates. Evaluated on Microsoft's ExCyTIn-Bench, an open-source benchmark simulating complex cyberthreat investigation, ATLAS achieves 54.1% success with GPT-5-mini as its Student, outperforming the larger GPT-5 (High) by 13% while reducing cost by 86%. Cross-incident validation demonstrates generalization: frozen pamphlets from Incident #5 improve accuracy from 28% to 41% with zero retraining, while shifting output composition from verbose exploration to structured reasoning. Together, these findings establish gradient-free continual learning as a viable path toward adaptive, deployable AI systems and provide causally annotated traces valuable for training explicit world models.

Abstract: Long-horizon decision-making with sparse rewards and continuous states and actions remains a fundamental challenge in AI and robotics. Task and motion planning (TAMP) is a model-based framework that addresses this challenge by planning hierarchically with abstract actions (options). These options are manually defined, limiting the agent to behaviors that we as human engineers know how to program (pick, place, move). In this work, we propose Shortcut Learning for Abstract Planning (SLAP), a method that leverages existing TAMP options to automatically discover new ones. Our key idea is to use model-free reinforcement learning (RL) to learn shortcuts in the abstract planning graph induced by the existing options in TAMP. Without any additional assumptions or inputs, shortcut learning leads to shorter solutions than pure planning, and higher task success rates than flat and hierarchical RL. Qualitatively, SLAP discovers dynamic physical improvisations (e.g., slap, wiggle, wipe) that differ significantly from the manually-defined ones. In experiments in four simulated robotic environments, we show that SLAP solves and generalizes to a wide range of tasks, reducing overall plan lengths by over 50% and consistently outperforming planning and RL baselines.

arXiv:2511.01149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of a single agent in task decomposition and collaboration during complex task execution, and proposes a multi-agent architecture for modular task decomposition and dynamic collaboration based on large language models. The method first converts natural language task descriptions into unified semantic representations through a large language model. On this basis, a modular decomposition mechanism is introduced to break down the overall goal into multiple hierarchical sub-tasks. Then, dynamic scheduling and routing mechanisms enable reasonable division of labor and realtime collaboration among agents, allowing the system to adjust strategies continuously according to environmental feedback, thus maintaining efficiency and stability in complex tasks. Furthermore, a constraint parsing and global consistency mechanism is designed to ensure coherent connections between sub-tasks and balanced workload, preventing performance degradation caused by redundant communication or uneven resource allocation. The experiments validate the architecture across multiple dimensions, including task success rate, decomposition efficiency, sub-task coverage, and collaboration balance. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in both overall performance and robustness, achieving a better balance between task complexity and communication overhead. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness and feasibility of language-driven task decomposition and dynamic collaboration in multi-agent systems, providing a systematic solution for task execution in complex environments.

<title>From Best Responses to Learning: Investment Efficiency in Dynamic Environment</title>

Abstract: We study the welfare of a mechanism in a dynamic environment where a learning investor can make a costly investment to change her value. In many real-world problems, the common assumption that the investor always makes the best responses, i.e., choosing her utility-maximizing investment option, is unrealistic due to incomplete information in a dynamically evolving environment. To address this, we consider an investor who uses a no-regret online learning algorithm to adaptively select investments through repeated interactions with the environment. We analyze how the welfare guarantees of approximation allocation algorithms extend from static to dynamic settings when the investor learns rather than best-responds, by studying the approximation ratio for optimal welfare as a measurement of an algorithm's performance against different benchmarks in the dynamic learning environment. First, we show that the approximation ratio in the static environment remains unchanged in the dynamic environment against the best-in-hindsight benchmark. Second, we provide tight characterizations of the approximation upper and lower bounds relative to a stronger time-varying benchmark. Bridging mechanism design with online learning theory, our work shows how robust welfare guarantees can be maintained even when an agent cannot make best responses but learns their investment strategies in complex, uncertain environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with agent-based reasoning frameworks have recently shown strong potential for autonomous decision-making and system-level operations. One promising yet underexplored direction is microservice remediation, where the goal is to automatically recover faulty microservice systems. Existing approaches, however, still rely on human-crafted prompts from Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), with LLMs merely converting textual instructions into executable code. To advance research in this area, we introduce MicroRemed, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in end-to-end microservice remediation, where models must directly generate executable Ansible playbooks from diagnosis reports to restore system functionality. We further propose ThinkRemed, a multi-agent framework that emulates the reflective and perceptive reasoning of SREs. Experimental results show that MicroRemed presents substantial challenges to current LLMs, while ThinkRemed improves end-to-end remediation performance through iterative reasoning and system reflection. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/LLM4AIOps/MicroRemed.

Abstract: Salespeople frequently face the dynamic screening decision of whether to persist in a conversation or abandon it to pursue the next lead. Yet, little is known about how these decisions are made, whether they are efficient, or how to improve them. We study these decisions in the context of high-volume outbound sales where leads are ample, but time is scarce and failure is common. We formalize the dynamic screening decision as an optimal stopping problem and develop a generative language model-based sequential decision agent - a stopping agent - that learns whether and when to quit conversations by imitating a retrospectively-inferred optimal stopping policy. Our approach handles high-dimensional textual states, scales to large language models, and works with both open-source and proprietary language models. When applied to calls from a large European telecommunications firm, our stopping agent reduces the time spent on failed calls by 54% while preserving nearly all sales; reallocating the time saved increases expected sales by up to 37%. Upon examining the linguistic cues that drive salespeople's quitting decisions, we find that they tend to overweight a few salient expressions of consumer disinterest and mispredict call failure risk, suggesting cognitive bounds on their ability to make real-time conversational decisions. Our findings highlight the potential of artificial intelligence algorithms to correct cognitively-bounded human decisions and improve salesforce efficiency.

Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news threatens social stability and public trust, rendering its detection an imperative research priority. Although large language models (LLMs) excel at numerous natural language processing tasks with their remarkable contextual understanding and extensive prior knowledge, the time-bounded knowledge coverage and tendency for generating hallucination content reduce their reliability when handling fast-evolving news streams. Furthermore, models trained on existing static datasets also often lack the generalization needed for emerging news topics. To address these challenges, we propose ZoFia, a novel two-stage zero-shot fake news detection framework. First, we introduce Hierarchical Salience to quantify the importance of entities in the news content, and propose the SC-MMR algorithm to effectively select an informative and diverse set of keywords that serve as queries for retrieving up-to-date external evidence. Subsequently, a multi LLM interactive system, in which each agent assumes a distinct role, performs multi-view collaborative analysis and adversarial debate over the news text and its related information, and finally produces an interpretable and robust judgment. Comprehensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that ZoFia obviously outperforms existing zero-shot baselines and most of few-shot methods. Our codes will be open-sourced to facilitate related communities.

Abstract: Generative AI is increasingly positioned as a peer in collaborative learning, yet its effects on ethical deliberation remain unclear. We report a between-subjects experiment with university students (N=217) who discussed an autonomous-vehicle dilemma in triads under three conditions: human-only control, supportive AI teammate, or contrarian AI teammate. Using moral foundations lexicons, argumentative coding from the augmentative knowledge construction framework, semantic trajectory modelling with BERTopic and dynamic time warping, and epistemic network analysis, we traced how AI personas reshape moral discourse. Supportive AIs increased grounded/qualified claims relative to control, consolidating integrative reasoning around care/fairness, while contrarian AIs modestly broadened moral framing and sustained value pluralism. Both AI conditions reduced thematic drift compared with human-only groups, indicating more stable topical focus. Post-discussion justification complexity was only weakly predicted by moral framing and reasoning quality, and shifts in final moral decisions were driven primarily by participants' initial stance rather than condition. Overall, AI teammates altered the process, the distribution and connection of moral frames and argument quality, more than the outcome of moral choice, highlighting the potential of generative AI agents as teammates for eliciting reflective, pluralistic moral reasoning in collaborative learning.

Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates the strategic placement of charging stations to optimize resource utilization and minimize user inconvenience. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers an innovative approach to identifying optimal charging station locations; however, existing methods face challenges due to their deterministic reward systems, which limit efficiency. Because real-world conditions are dynamic and uncertain, a deterministic reward structure cannot fully capture the complexities of charging station placement. As a result, evaluation becomes costly and time-consuming, and less reflective of real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates deep RL with agent-based simulations to model EV movement and estimate charging demand in real time. Our approach employs a hybrid RL agent with dual Q-networks to select optimal locations and configure charging ports, guided by a hybrid reward function that combines deterministic factors with simulation-derived feedback. Case studies in Hanoi, Vietnam, show that our method reduces average waiting times by 53.28% compared to the initial state, outperforming static baseline methods. This scalable and adaptive solution enhances EV infrastructure planning, effectively addressing real-world complexities and improving user experience.

<title>Don't Just Search, Understand: Semantic Path Planning Agent for Spherical Tensegrity Robots in Unknown Environments</title>

Abstract: Endowed with inherent dynamical properties that grant them remarkable ruggedness and adaptability, spherical tensegrity robots stand as prototypical examples of hybrid softrigid designs and excellent mobile platforms. However, path planning for these robots in unknown environments presents a significant challenge, requiring a delicate balance between efficient exploration and robust planning. Traditional path planners, which treat the environment as a geometric grid, often suffer from redundant searches and are prone to failure in complex scenarios due to their lack of semantic understanding. To overcome these limitations, we reframe path planning in unknown environments as a semantic reasoning task. We introduce a Semantic Agent for Tensegrity robots (SATPlanner) driven by a Large Language Model (LLM). SATPlanner leverages high-level environmental comprehension to generate efficient and reliable planning strategies.At the core of SATPlanner is an Adaptive Observation Window mechanism, inspired by the "fast" and "slow" thinking paradigms of LLMs. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the perceptual field of the agent: it narrows for rapid traversal of open spaces and expands to reason about complex obstacle configurations. This allows the agent to construct a semantic belief of the environment, enabling the search space to grow only linearly with the path length (O(L)) while maintaining path quality. We extensively evaluate SATPlanner in 1,000 simulation trials, where it achieves a 100% success rate, outperforming other real-time planning algorithms. Critically, SATPlanner reduces the search space by 37.2% compared to the A* algorithm while achieving comparable, near-optimal path lengths. Finally, the practical feasibility of SATPlanner is validated on a physical spherical tensegrity robot prototype.

Abstract: Learning cooperative multi-agent policies directly from high-dimensional, multimodal sensory inputs like pixels and audio (from pixels) is notoriously sample-inefficient. Model-free Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms struggle with the joint challenge of representation learning, partial observability, and credit assignment. To address this, we propose a novel framework based on a shared, generative Multimodal World Model (MWM). Our MWM is trained to learn a compressed latent representation of the environment's dynamics by fusing distributed, multimodal observations from all agents using a scalable attention-based mechanism. Subsequently, we leverage this learned MWM as a fast, "imagined" simulator to train cooperative MARL policies (e.g., MAPPO) entirely within its latent space, decoupling representation learning from policy learning. We introduce a new set of challenging multimodal, multi-agent benchmarks built on a 3D physics simulator. Our experiments demonstrate that our MWM-MARL framework achieves orders-of-magnitude greater sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art model-free MARL baselines. We further show that our proposed multimodal fusion is essential for task success in environments with sensory asymmetry and that our architecture provides superior robustness to sensor-dropout, a critical feature for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Accurate point-wise velocity estimation in 3D is crucial for robot interaction with non-rigid, dynamic agents, such as humans, enabling robust performance in path planning, collision avoidance, and object manipulation in dynamic environments. To this end, this paper proposes a novel RADAR, LiDAR, and camera fusion pipeline for point-wise 3D velocity estimation named CaRLi-V. This pipeline leverages raw RADAR measurements to create a novel RADAR representation, the velocity cube, which densely represents radial velocities within the RADAR's field-of-view. By combining the velocity cube for radial velocity extraction, optical flow for tangential velocity estimation, and LiDAR for point-wise range measurements through a closed-form solution, our approach can produce 3D velocity estimates for a dense array of points. Developed as an open-source ROS2 package, CaRLi-V has been field-tested against a custom dataset and proven to produce low velocity error metrics relative to ground truth, enabling point-wise velocity estimation for robotic applications.

<title>Modulation of temporal decision-making in a deep reinforcement learning agent under the dual-task paradigm</title>

Abstract: This study explores the interference in temporal processing within a dual-task paradigm from an artificial intelligence (AI) perspective. In this context, the dual-task setup is implemented as a simplified version of the Overcooked environment with two variations, single task (T) and dual task (T+N). Both variations involve an embedded time production task, but the dual task (T+N) additionally involves a concurrent number comparison task. Two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents were separately trained for each of these tasks. These agents exhibited emergent behavior consistent with human timing research. Specifically, the dual task (T+N) agent exhibited significant overproduction of time relative to its single task (T) counterpart. This result was consistent across four target durations. Preliminary analysis of neural dynamics in the agents' LSTM layers did not reveal any clear evidence of a dedicated or intrinsic timer. Hence, further investigation is needed to better understand the underlying time-keeping mechanisms of the agents and to provide insights into the observed behavioral patterns. This study is a small step towards exploring parallels between emergent DRL behavior and behavior observed in biological systems in order to facilitate a better understanding of both.

Abstract: Explanations for AI models in high-stakes domains like medicine often lack verifiability, which can hinder trust. To address this, we propose an interactive agent that produces explanations through an auditable sequence of actions. The agent learns a policy to strategically seek external visual evidence to support its diagnostic reasoning. This policy is optimized using reinforcement learning, resulting in a model that is both efficient and generalizable. Our experiments show that this action-based reasoning process significantly improves calibrated accuracy, reducing the Brier score by 18\% compared to a non-interactive baseline. To validate the faithfulness of the agent's explanations, we introduce a causal intervention method. By masking the visual evidence the agent chooses to use, we observe a measurable degradation in its performance ($\Delta$Brier=+0.029), confirming that the evidence is integral to its decision-making process. Our work provides a practical framework for building AI systems with verifiable and faithful reasoning capabilities.

<title>From Passive to Proactive: A Multi-Agent System with Dynamic Task Orchestration for Intelligent Medical Pre-Consultation</title>

Abstract: Global healthcare systems face critical challenges from increasing patient volumes and limited consultation times, with primary care visits averaging under 5 minutes in many countries. While pre-consultation processes encompassing triage and structured history-taking offer potential solutions, they remain limited by passive interaction paradigms and context management challenges in existing AI systems. This study introduces a hierarchical multi-agent framework that transforms passive medical AI systems into proactive inquiry agents through autonomous task orchestration. We developed an eight-agent architecture with centralized control mechanisms that decomposes pre-consultation into four primary tasks: Triage ($T_1$), History of Present Illness collection ($T_2$), Past History collection ($T_3$), and Chief Complaint generation ($T_4$), with $T_1$--$T_3$ further divided into 13 domain-specific subtasks. Evaluated on 1,372 validated electronic health records from a Chinese medical platform across multiple foundation models (GPT-OSS 20B, Qwen3-8B, Phi4-14B), the framework achieved 87.0% accuracy for primary department triage and 80.5% for secondary department classification, with task completion rates reaching 98.2% using agent-driven scheduling versus 93.1% with sequential processing. Clinical quality scores from 18 physicians averaged 4.56 for Chief Complaints, 4.48 for History of Present Illness, and 4.69 for Past History on a 5-point scale, with consultations completed within 12.7 rounds for $T_2$ and 16.9 rounds for $T_3$. The model-agnostic architecture maintained high performance across different foundation models while preserving data privacy through local deployment, demonstrating the potential for autonomous AI systems to enhance pre-consultation efficiency and quality in clinical settings.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit remarkable conversational and reasoning capabilities but remain constrained by limited context windows and the lack of persistent memory. Recent efforts address these limitations via external memory architectures, often employing graph-based representations, yet most adopt flat, entangled structures that intertwine semantics with topology, leading to redundant representations, unstructured retrieval, and degraded efficiency and accuracy. To resolve these issues, we propose LiCoMemory, an end-to-end agentic memory framework for real-time updating and retrieval, which introduces CogniGraph, a lightweight hierarchical graph that utilizes entities and relations as semantic indexing layers, and employs temporal and hierarchy-aware search with integrated reranking for adaptive and coherent knowledge retrieval. Experiments on long-term dialogue benchmarks, LoCoMo and LongMemEval, show that LiCoMemory not only outperforms established baselines in temporal reasoning, multi-session consistency, and retrieval efficiency, but also notably reduces update latency. Our official code and data are available at https://github.com/EverM0re/LiCoMemory.

Abstract: This work presents a requirement analysis for collaborative dialogues among medical experts and an inquiry dialogue game based on this analysis for incorporating explainability into multiagent system design. The game allows experts with different knowledge bases to collaboratively make recommendations while generating rich traces of the reasoning process through combining explanation-based illocutionary forces in an inquiry dialogue. The dialogue game was implemented as a prototype web-application and evaluated against the specification through a formative user study. The user study confirms that the dialogue game meets the needs for collaboration among medical experts. It also provides insights on the real-life value of dialogue-based communication tools for the medical community.

Abstract: Guiding an agent to a specific target in indoor environments based solely on RGB inputs and a floor plan is a promising yet challenging problem. Although existing methods have made significant progress, two challenges remain unresolved. First, the modality gap between egocentric RGB observations and the floor plan hinders the integration of visual and spatial information for both local obstacle avoidance and global planning. Second, accurate localization is critical for navigation performance, but remains challenging at deployment in unseen environments due to the lack of explicit geometric alignment between RGB inputs and floor plans. We propose a novel diffusion-based policy, denoted as GlocDiff, which integrates global path planning from the floor plan with local depth-aware features derived from RGB observations. The floor plan offers explicit global guidance, while the depth features provide implicit geometric cues, collectively enabling precise prediction of optimal navigation directions and robust obstacle avoidance. Moreover, GlocDiff introduces noise perturbation during training to enhance robustness against pose estimation errors, and we find that combining this with a relatively stable VO module during inference results in significantly improved navigation performance. Extensive experiments on the FloNa benchmark demonstrate GlocDiff's efficiency and effectiveness in achieving superior navigation performance, and the success of real-world deployments also highlights its potential for widespread practical applications.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have exhibited strong problem-solving competence across domains like research and coding. Yet, it remains underexplored whether LLM agents can tackle compounding real-world problems that require a diverse set of tools to complete. Given a broad, heterogeneous tool repository, LLM agents must not only select appropriate tools based on task planning analysis but also strategically schedule the execution order to ensure efficiency. This paper introduces TPS-Bench to benchmark the ability of LLM agents in solving such problems that demand Tool Planning and Scheduling. TPS-Bench collects 200 compounding tasks of two difficulty levels, based on a tool repository containing hundreds of model context protocol (MCP) tools. In particular, each task is composed of multiple subtasks, such as web search, map navigation, calendar checking, etc., and each subtask can be completed by a basic tool. Our evaluation emphasizes both task completion rate and efficiency. The empirical studies on popular closed-source and open-source LLMs indicate that most models can perform reasonable tool planning, but differ in scheduling. For example, GLM-4.5 achieves an outperforming task completion rate of 64.72% with extensive sequential tool calls, hence suffering from significantly long execution time. By contrast, GPT-4o prioritizes parallel tool calls but achieves only a 45.08% completion rate. Considering reinforcement learning (RL) can be a viable way to improve the scheduling efficiency without compromising performance, we perform an initial study on Qwen3-1.7B and witness a 14% reduction in execution time alongside a 6% gain in task completion rate based on rarely 100 RL training samples. Our code is available https://github.com/hanwenxu1/mcp-agent.

Abstract: Rare and challenging driving scenarios are critical for autonomous vehicle development. Since they are difficult to encounter, simulating or generating them using generative models is a popular approach. Following previous efforts to structure driving scenario representations in a layer model, we propose a structured five-layer model to improve the evaluation and generation of rare scenarios. We use this model alongside large foundational models to generate new driving scenarios using a data augmentation strategy. Unlike previous representations, our structure introduces subclasses and characteristics for every agent of the scenario, allowing us to compare them using an embedding specific to our layer-model. We study and adapt two metrics to evaluate the relevance of a synthetic dataset in the context of a structured representation: the diversity score estimates how different the scenarios of a dataset are from one another, while the originality score calculates how similar a synthetic dataset is from a real reference set. This paper showcases both metrics in different generation setup, as well as a qualitative evaluation of synthetic videos generated from structured scenario descriptions. The code and extended results can be found at https://github.com/Valgiz/5LMSG.

Abstract: Effective communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is critical for success but constrained by bandwidth, yet past approaches have been limited to complex gating mechanisms that only decide \textit{whether} to communicate, not \textit{how precisely}. Learning to optimize message precision at the bit-level is fundamentally harder, as the required discretization step breaks gradient flow. We address this by generalizing Differentiable Discrete Communication Learning (DDCL), a framework for end-to-end optimization of discrete messages. Our primary contribution is an extension of DDCL to support unbounded signals, transforming it into a universal, plug-and-play layer for any MARL architecture. We verify our approach with three key results. First, through a qualitative analysis in a controlled environment, we demonstrate \textit{how} agents learn to dynamically modulate message precision according to the informational needs of the task. Second, we integrate our variant of DDCL into four state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, showing it reduces bandwidth by over an order of magnitude while matching or exceeding task performance. Finally, we provide direct evidence for the \enquote{Bitter Lesson} in MARL communication: a simple Transformer-based policy leveraging DDCL matches the performance of complex, specialized architectures, questioning the necessity of bespoke communication designs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in cross-modal understanding and reasoning, offering new opportunities for intelligent assistive systems, yet existing systems still struggle with risk-aware planning, user personalization, and grounding language plans into executable skills in cluttered homes. We introduce MARS - a Multi-Agent Robotic System powered by MLLMs for assistive intelligence and designed for smart home robots supporting people with disabilities. The system integrates four agents: a visual perception agent for extracting semantic and spatial features from environment images, a risk assessment agent for identifying and prioritizing hazards, a planning agent for generating executable action sequences, and an evaluation agent for iterative optimization. By combining multimodal perception with hierarchical multi-agent decision-making, the framework enables adaptive, risk-aware, and personalized assistance in dynamic indoor environments. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior overall performance of the proposed system in risk-aware planning and coordinated multi-agent execution compared with state-of-the-art multimodal models. The proposed approach also highlights the potential of collaborative AI for practical assistive scenarios and provides a generalizable methodology for deploying MLLM-enabled multi-agent systems in real-world environments.

Abstract: In the real business world, data is stored in a variety of sources, including structured relational databases, unstructured databases (e.g., NoSQL databases), or even CSV/excel files. The ability to extract reasonable insights across these diverse source is vital for business success. Existing benchmarks, however, are limited in assessing agents' capabilities across these diverse data types. To address this gap, we introduce UniDataBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of data analytics agents in handling diverse data sources. Specifically, UniDataBench is originating from real-life industry analysis report and we then propose a pipeline to remove the privacy and sensitive information. It encompasses a wide array of datasets, including relational databases, CSV files to NoSQL data, reflecting real-world business scenarios, and provides unified framework to assess how effectively agents can explore multiple data formats, extract valuable insights, and generate meaningful summaries and recommendations. Based on UniDataBench, we propose a novel LLM-based agent named ReActInsight, an autonomous agent that performs end-to-end analysis over diverse data sources by automatically discovering cross-source linkages, decomposing goals, and generating robust, self-correcting code to extract actionable insights. Our benchmark and agent together provide a powerful framework for advancing the capabilities of data analytics agents in real-world applications.

arXiv:2511.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Chain-of-Thought (Graph-CoT) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform step-by-step reasoning over graph-structured knowledge, but existing pipelines suffer from low accuracy, excessive token usage, high latency, and low throughput due to single-agent monolithic prompts, repeated context re-encoding, and inefficient serving execution. We present GLM, the first multi-agent Graph-CoT system co-designed with an optimized LLM serving architecture. GLM decomposes reasoning into specialized agents for classification, reasoning, action generation, and graph retrieval, enabling branching and selective context sharing to reduce prompt length and reasoning iterations while preserving reasoning quality, thereby improving accuracy and reducing overall token consumption. To scale inference, we introduce a Graph-CoT-aware LLM inference mechanism with graph-specific KV-cache management, priority-based eviction, and pipelined execution to improve serving efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that GLM improves answer accuracy by up to 38%, reduces token cost by up to 95.7%, lowers inference latency by 90.3%, and achieves up to 15.1x higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art Graph-CoT baselines, enabling efficient adoption for complex real-world reasoning at scale.

<title>Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation Agent for Trustworthy Legal Question Answering in Judicial Forensics</title>

Abstract: As artificial intelligence permeates judicial forensics, ensuring the veracity and traceability of legal question answering (QA) has become critical. Conventional large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, risking misleading guidance in legal consultation, while static knowledge bases struggle to keep pace with frequently updated statutes and case law. We present a hybrid legal QA agent tailored for judicial settings that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-model ensembling to deliver reliable, auditable, and continuously updatable counsel. The system prioritizes retrieval over generation: when a trusted legal repository yields relevant evidence, answers are produced via RAG; otherwise, multiple LLMs generate candidates that are scored by a specialized selector, with the top-ranked answer returned. High-quality outputs then undergo human review before being written back to the repository, enabling dynamic knowledge evolution and provenance tracking. Experiments on the Law\_QA dataset show that our hybrid approach significantly outperforms both a single-model baseline and a vanilla RAG pipeline on F1, ROUGE-L, and an LLM-as-a-Judge metric. Ablations confirm the complementary contributions of retrieval prioritization, model ensembling, and the human-in-the-loop update mechanism. The proposed system demonstrably reduces hallucination while improving answer quality and legal compliance, advancing the practical landing of media forensics technologies in judicial scenarios.

Abstract: The growing demand for on-device large language model (LLM) inference highlights the need for efficient mobile edge computing (MEC) solutions, especially in resource-constrained settings. Speculative decoding offers a promising solution by partitioning token generation between a lightweight draft model on mobile devices and a powerful target model on edge servers, but suffers from communication overhead and asynchronous delays. This paper is the first to propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes user association and resource allocation (UARA) to support efficient parallel speculative decoding. We solve the UARA problem using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. To evaluate our approach under realistic conditions, we conduct experiments using the Sionna simulator. Results show that our method achieves up to 28.0% and an average of 23.7% reduction in end-to-end latency without compromising inference accuracy, enabling scalable and low-latency LLM services in MEC systems.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models aim to understand natural language instructions and visual observations and to execute corresponding actions as an embodied agent. Recent work integrates future images into the understanding-acting loop, yielding unified VLAs that jointly understand, generate, and act -- reading text and images and producing future images and actions. However, these models either rely on external experts for modality unification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate processes, limiting the benefits of direct synergy between these tasks. Our core philosophy is to optimize generation and action jointly through a synchronous denoising process, where the iterative refinement enables actions to evolve from initialization, under constant and sufficient visual guidance. We ground this philosophy in our proposed Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint Discrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P), which is a joint diffusion process that integrates multiple modalities into a single denoising trajectory to serve as the key mechanism enabling understanding, generation, and acting to be intrinsically synergistic. Our model and theory are built on a unified tokenized space of all modalities and a hybrid attention mechanism. We further propose a two-stage training pipeline and several inference-time techniques that optimize performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as CALVIN, LIBERO, and SimplerEnv with 4$\times$ faster inference than autoregressive methods, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through in-depth analysis and real-world evaluations.

Abstract: Visual grounding in 3D is the key for embodied agents to localize language-referred objects in open-world environments. However, existing benchmarks are limited to indoor focus, single-platform constraints, and small scale. We introduce 3EED, a multi-platform, multi-modal 3D grounding benchmark featuring RGB and LiDAR data from vehicle, drone, and quadruped platforms. We provide over 128,000 objects and 22,000 validated referring expressions across diverse outdoor scenes -- 10x larger than existing datasets. We develop a scalable annotation pipeline combining vision-language model prompting with human verification to ensure high-quality spatial grounding. To support cross-platform learning, we propose platform-aware normalization and cross-modal alignment techniques, and establish benchmark protocols for in-domain and cross-platform evaluations. Our findings reveal significant performance gaps, highlighting the challenges and opportunities of generalizable 3D grounding. The 3EED dataset and benchmark toolkit are released to advance future research in language-driven 3D embodied perception.

<title>Accumulating Context Changes the Beliefs of Language Models</title>

Abstract: Language model (LM) assistants are increasingly used in applications such as brainstorming and research. Improvements in memory and context size have allowed these models to become more autonomous, which has also resulted in more text accumulation in their context windows without explicit user intervention. This comes with a latent risk: the belief profiles of models -- their understanding of the world as manifested in their responses or actions -- may silently change as context accumulates. This can lead to subtly inconsistent user experiences, or shifts in behavior that deviate from the original alignment of the models. In this paper, we explore how accumulating context by engaging in interactions and processing text -- talking and reading -- can change the beliefs of language models, as manifested in their responses and behaviors.Our results reveal that models' belief profiles are highly malleable: GPT-5 exhibits a 54.7% shift in its stated beliefs after 10 rounds of discussion about moral dilemmas and queries about safety, while Grok 4 shows a 27.2% shift on political issues after reading texts from the opposing position. We also examine models' behavioral changes by designing tasks that require tool use, where each tool selection corresponds to an implicit belief. We find that these changes align with stated belief shifts, suggesting that belief shifts will be reflected in actual behavior in agentic systems. Our analysis exposes the hidden risk of belief shift as models undergo extended sessions of talking or reading, rendering their opinions and actions unreliable.

Abstract: The ability to connect visual patterns with the processes that form them represents one of the deepest forms of visual understanding. Textures of clouds and waves, the growth of cities and forests, or the formation of materials and landscapes are all examples of patterns emerging from underlying mechanisms. We present the Scitextures dataset, a large-scale collection of textures and visual patterns from all domains of science, tech, and art, along with the models and code that generate these images. Covering over 1,200 different models and 100,000 images of patterns and textures from physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, technology, mathematics, and art, this dataset offers a way to explore the connection between the visual patterns that shape our world and the mechanisms that produce them. Created by an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously collects and implements models in standardized form, we use SciTextures to evaluate the ability of leading AI models to link visual patterns to the models and code that generate them, and to identify different patterns that emerged from the same process. We also test AIs ability to infer and recreate the mechanisms behind visual patterns by providing a natural image of a real-world pattern and asking the AI to identify, model, and code the mechanism that formed the pattern, then run this code to generate a simulated image that is compared to the real image. These benchmarks show that vision-language models (VLMs) can understand and simulate the physical system beyond a visual pattern.

Abstract: LLM agents excel in compact environments requiring deep reasoning but remain brittle when operating in broader, more complex contexts that demand robustness across diverse tools and schemas. Building bespoke environments for training is heavy, brittle, and limits progress. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs can simulate realistic environment feedback without access to actual testbed data or APIs. Inspired by this capability, we propose two frameworks: Simia-SFT, a pipeline that synthesizes SFT data by amplifying small seed sets into diverse trajectories in an environment-agnostic manner, and Simia-RL, a framework that enables RL training without real environment implementations through LLM-simulated feedback. Fine-tuning open models yields consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks, surpassing GPT-4o and approaching o4-mini on $\tau^2$-Bench. Together, Simia-SFT and Simia-RL enable scalable agent training without environment engineering, replacing heavy and brittle implementations with flexible LLM-based simulation.

Abstract: The frontier of visual reasoning is shifting toward models like OpenAI o3, which can intelligently create and operate tools to transform images for problem-solving, also known as thinking-\textit{with}-images in chain-of-thought. Yet existing benchmarks fail to fully capture this advanced capability. Even Visual Search, the most common benchmark for current thinking-\textit{with}-images methods, tests only basic operations such as localization and cropping, offering little insight into more complex, dynamic, and tool-dependent reasoning. We introduce \textbf{TIR-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating agentic thinking-with-images across 13 diverse tasks, each requiring novel tool use for image processing and manipulation in chain-of-thought. We evaluate 22 multimodal large language models (MLLMs), from leading open-sourced and proprietary models to those with explicit tool-use augmentation. Results show that TIR-Bench is universally challenging, and strong performance requires genuine thinking-with-images capabilities. Finally, we present a pilot study comparing direct versus agentic fine-tuning.

<title>Tool-to-Agent Retrieval: Bridging Tools and Agents for Scalable LLM Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM Multi-Agent Systems enable scalable orchestration of sub-agents, each coordinating hundreds or thousands of tools or Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. However, existing retrieval methods typically match queries against coarse agent-level descriptions before routing, which obscures fine-grained tool functionality and often results in suboptimal agent selection. We introduce Tool-to-Agent Retrieval, a unified framework that embeds both tools and their parent agents in a shared vector space and connects them through metadata relationships. By explicitly representing tool capabilities and traversing metadata to the agent level, Tool-to-Agent Retrieval enables granular tool-level or agent-level retrieval, ensuring that agents and their underlying tools or MCP servers are equally represented without the context dilution that arises from chunking many tools together. Evaluating Tool-to-Agent Retrieval across eight embedding models, our approach achieves consistent improvements of 19.4% in Recall@5 and 17.7% in nDCG@5 over previous state-of-the-art agent retrievers on the LiveMCPBench benchmark.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning is a powerful tool to model decision-making processes. However, it relies on an exploration-exploitation trade-off that remains an open challenge for many tasks. In this work, we study neighboring state-based, model-free exploration led by the intuition that, for an early-stage agent, considering actions derived from a bounded region of nearby states may lead to better actions when exploring. We propose two algorithms that choose exploratory actions based on a survey of nearby states, and find that one of our methods, ${\rho}$-explore, consistently outperforms the Double DQN baseline in an discrete environment by 49% in terms of Eval Reward Return.

Abstract: This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of large language models (LLM) architectures and strategies for "complex" question-answering with a focus on hybrid architectures. LLM based chatbot services have allowed anyone to grasp the potential of LLM to solve many common problems, but soon discovered their limitations for complex questions. Addressing more specific, complex questions (e.g., "What is the best mix of power-generation methods to reduce climate change ?") often requires specialized architectures, domain knowledge, new skills, decomposition and multi-step resolution, deep reasoning, sensitive data protection, explainability, and human-in-the-loop processes. Therefore, we review: (1) necessary skills and tasks for handling complex questions and common LLM limits to overcome; (2) dataset, cost functions and evaluation metrics for measuring and improving (e.g. accuracy, explainability, fairness, robustness, groundedness, faithfulness, toxicity...); (3) family of solutions to overcome LLM limitations by (a) training and reinforcement (b) hybridization, (c) prompting, (d) agentic-architectures (agents, tools) and extended reasoning.

Abstract: Inspired by the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM agents have evolved to perform complex tasks. LLM agents are now extensively applied across various domains, handling vast amounts of data to interact with humans and execute tasks. The widespread applications of LLM agents demonstrate their significant commercial value; however, they also expose security and privacy vulnerabilities. At the current stage, comprehensive research on the security and privacy of LLM agents is highly needed. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the newly emerged privacy and security issues faced by LLM agents. We begin by introducing the fundamental knowledge of LLM agents, followed by a categorization and analysis of the threats. We then discuss the impacts of these threats on humans, environment, and other agents. Subsequently, we review existing defensive strategies, and finally explore future trends. Additionally, the survey incorporates diverse case studies to facilitate a more accessible understanding. By highlighting these critical security and privacy issues, the survey seeks to stimulate future research towards enhancing the security and privacy of LLM agents, thereby increasing their reliability and trustworthiness in future applications.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a crucial computational tool for researchers to understand and engineer molecular structure and function in areas such as drug discovery, protein engineering, and material design. Despite their utility, MD simulations are expensive, owing to the high dimensionality of molecular systems. Interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) has recently emerged as a "human-in-the-loop" strategy for efficiently navigating hyper-dimensional molecular systems. By providing an immersive 3D environment that enables visualization and manipulation of real-time molecular simulations running on high-performance computing architectures, iMD-VR enables researchers to reach out and guide molecular conformational dynamics, in order to efficiently explore complex, high-dimensional molecular systems. Moreover, iMD-VR simulations generate rich datasets that capture human experts' spatial insight regarding molecular structure and function. This paper explores the use of researcher-generated iMD-VR datasets to train AI agents via imitation learning (IL). IL enables agents to mimic complex behaviours from expert demonstrations, circumventing the need for explicit programming or intricate reward design. In this article, we review IL across robotics and Multi-agents systems domains which are comparable to iMD-VR, and discuss how iMD-VR recordings could be used to train IL models to interact with MD simulations. We then illustrate the applications of these ideas through a proof-of-principle study where iMD-VR data was used to train a CNN network on a simple molecular manipulation task; namely, threading a small molecule through a nanotube pore. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential challenges of using AI agents to augment human expertise in navigating vast molecular conformational spaces.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or outdated information, especially in low-resource settings or when dealing with private data. To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) uses external knowledge bases (KBs), but these can also suffer from inaccuracies. We introduce STACKFEED, a novel Structured Textual Actor-Critic Knowledge base editing with FEEDback approach that iteratively refines the KB based on expert feedback using a multi-actor, centralized critic reinforcement learning framework. STACKFEED defines a ReACT actor agent on each document to perform structured edits based on document specific targeted instructions. Experimental results showcase that STACKFEED significantly improves KB quality and performance of the RAG system. We evaluate STACKFEED on low-resource programming problems, modified python packaged and factual question-answering tasks.

Abstract: The rapid growth of blockchain technology has driven the widespread adoption of smart contracts. However, their inherent vulnerabilities have led to significant financial losses. Traditional auditing methods, while essential, struggle to keep pace with the increasing complexity and scale of smart contracts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating vulnerability detection, but their adoption is often limited by high computational costs. Although prior work has explored leveraging large models through agents or workflows, relatively little attention has been given to improving the performance of smaller, fine-tuned models--a critical factor for achieving both efficiency and data privacy. In this paper, we introduce HKT-SmartAudit, a framework for developing lightweight models optimized for smart contract auditing. It features a multi-stage knowledge distillation pipeline that integrates classical distillation, external domain knowledge, and reward-guided learning to transfer high-quality insights from large teacher models. A single-task learning strategy is employed to train compact student models that maintain high accuracy and robustness while significantly reducing computational overhead. Experimental results show that our distilled models outperform both commercial tools and larger models in detecting complex vulnerabilities and logical flaws, offering a practical, secure, and scalable solution for smart contract auditing.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents rely on shortcut learning, preventing them from generalizing to slightly different environments. To address this problem, symbolic method, that use object-centric states, have been developed. However, comparing these methods to deep agents is not fair, as these last operate from raw pixel-based states. In this work, we instantiate the symbolic SCoBots framework. SCoBots decompose RL tasks into intermediate, interpretable representations, culminating in action decisions based on a comprehensible set of object-centric relational concepts. This architecture aids in demystifying agent decisions. By explicitly learning to extract object-centric representations from raw states, object-centric RL, and policy distillation via rule extraction, this work places itself within the neurosymbolic AI paradigm, blending the strengths of neural networks with symbolic AI. We present the first implementation of an end-to-end trained SCoBot, separately evaluate of its components, on different Atari games. The results demonstrate the framework's potential to create interpretable and performing RL systems, and pave the way for future research directions in obtaining end-to-end interpretable RL agents.

Abstract: Graphs are widely used for modeling relational data in real-world scenarios, such as social networks and urban computing. Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy. The code and data are available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/GraphTeam.

Abstract: As AI systems are integrated into social networks, there are AI safety concerns that AI-generated content may dominate the web, e.g. in popularity or impact on beliefs. To understand such questions, this paper proposes the Digital Ecosystem of Beliefs (Digico), the first evolutionary framework for controlled experimentation with multi-population interactions in simulated social networks. Following a Universal Darwinism approach, the framework models a population of agents which change their messaging strategies due to evolutionary updates. They interact via messages, update their beliefs following a contagion model, and maintain their beliefs through cognitive Lamarckian inheritance. Initial experiments with Digico implement two types of agents, which are modelled to represent AIs vs humans based on higher rates of communication, higher rates of evolution, seeding fixed beliefs with propaganda aims, and higher influence on the recommendation algorithm. These experiments show that: a) when AIs have faster messaging, evolution, and more influence on the recommendation algorithm, they get 80% to 95% of the views; b) AIs designed for propaganda can typically convince 50% of humans to adopt extreme beliefs, and up to 85% when agents believe only a limited number of channels; c) a penalty for content that violates agents' beliefs reduces propaganda effectiveness up to 8%. We further discuss Digico as a tool for systematic experimentation across multi-agent configurations, the implications for legislation, personal use, and platform design, and the use of Digico for studying evolutionary principles.

Abstract: Collaborative perception significantly enhances individual vehicle perception performance through the exchange of sensory information among agents. However, real-world deployment faces challenges due to bandwidth constraints and inevitable calibration errors during information exchange. To address these issues, we propose mmCooper, a novel multi-agent, multi-stage, communication-efficient, and collaboration-robust cooperative perception framework. Our framework leverages a multi-stage collaboration strategy that dynamically and adaptively balances intermediate- and late-stage information to share among agents, enhancing perceptual performance while maintaining communication efficiency. To support robust collaboration despite potential misalignments and calibration errors, our framework prevents misleading low-confidence sensing information from transmission and refines the received detection results from collaborators to improve accuracy. The extensive evaluation results on both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the mmCooper framework and its components.

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) enables agents to learn automatically and on-the-fly from their interactive experiences. However, a major challenge in scaling up ICRL is the lack of scalable task collections. To address this, we propose the procedurally generated tabular Markov Decision Processes, named AnyMDP. Through a carefully designed randomization process, AnyMDP is capable of generating high-quality tasks on a large scale while maintaining relatively low structural biases. To facilitate efficient meta-training at scale, we further introduce decoupled policy distillation and induce prior information in the ICRL framework. Our results demonstrate that, with a sufficiently large scale of AnyMDP tasks, the proposed model can generalize to tasks that were not considered in the training set through versatile in-context learning paradigms. The scalable task set provided by AnyMDP also enables a more thorough empirical investigation of the relationship between data distribution and ICRL performance. We further show that the generalization of ICRL potentially comes at the cost of increased task diversity and longer adaptation periods. This finding carries critical implications for scaling robust ICRL capabilities, highlighting the necessity of diverse and extensive task design, and prioritizing asymptotic performance over few-shot adaptation.

Abstract: The adoption of large language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents in software engineering marks an enduring paradigm shift. These systems create new opportunities for tool design, workflow orchestration, and empirical observation, while fundamentally reshaping the roles of developers and the artifacts they produce. Although traditional empirical methods remain central to software engineering research, the rapid evolution of AI introduces new data modalities, alters causal assumptions, and challenges foundational constructs such as "developer", "artifact", and "interaction". As humans and AI agents increasingly co-create, the boundaries between social and technical actors blur, and the reproducibility of findings becomes contingent on model updates and prompt contexts. This vision paper examines how the integration of LLMs into software engineering disrupts established research paradigms. We discuss how it transforms the phenomena we study, the methods and theories we rely on, the data we analyze, and the threats to validity that arise in dynamic AI-mediated environments. Our aim is to help the empirical software engineering community adapt its questions, instruments, and validation standards to a future in which AI systems are not merely tools, but active collaborators shaping software engineering and its study.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything technologies (V2X) have become an ideal paradigm to extend the perception range and see through the occlusion. Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves interactive reasoning where agents adapt their choices in response to others, yet existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often emphasize Nash Equilibrium (NE) approximation, overlooking the mechanisms driving their strategic choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce an evaluation framework grounded in behavioral game theory, disentangling reasoning capability from contextual effects. Testing 22 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that GPT-o3-mini, GPT-o1, and DeepSeek-R1 dominate most games yet also demonstrate that the model scale alone does not determine performance. In terms of prompting enhancement, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is not universally effective, as it increases strategic reasoning only for models at certain levels while providing limited gains elsewhere. Additionally, we investigate the impact of encoded demographic features on the models, observing that certain assignments impact the decision-making pattern. For instance, GPT-4o shows stronger strategic reasoning with female traits than males, while Gemma assigns higher reasoning levels to heterosexual identities compared to other sexual orientations, indicating inherent biases. These findings underscore the need for ethical standards and contextual alignment to balance improved reasoning with fairness.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of nodules in both 2D breast ultrasound (BUS) and 3D automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Therefore, developing an automated system for nodule segmentation can enhance user independence and expedite clinical analysis. Unlike fully-supervised learning, weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) can streamline the laborious and intricate annotation process. However, current WSS methods face challenges in achieving precise nodule segmentation, as many of them depend on inaccurate activation maps or inefficient pseudo-mask generation algorithms. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning-based WSS framework called Flip Learning, which relies solely on 2D/3D boxes for accurate segmentation. Specifically, multiple agents are employed to erase the target from the box to facilitate classification tag flipping, with the erased region serving as the predicted segmentation mask. The key contributions of this research are as follows: (1) Adoption of a superpixel/supervoxel-based approach to encode the standardized environment, capturing boundary priors and expediting the learning process. (2) Introduction of three meticulously designed rewards, comprising a classification score reward and two intensity distribution rewards, to steer the agents' erasing process precisely, thereby avoiding both under- and over-segmentation. (3) Implementation of a progressive curriculum learning strategy to enable agents to interact with the environment in a progressively challenging manner, thereby enhancing learning efficiency. Extensively validated on the large in-house BUS and ABUS datasets, our Flip Learning method outperforms state-of-the-art WSS methods and foundation models, and achieves comparable performance as fully-supervised learning algorithms.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have seen substantial advancements through deep thinking. However, these enhancements come with significant resource demands, underscoring the need for training effective small reasoning models. A critical challenge is that small models possess different reasoning capacities and cognitive trajectories compared with their larger counterparts. Hence, directly distilling chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales from large LRMs to smaller ones can sometimes be ineffective and often requires a substantial amount of annotated data. In this paper, we first introduce a novel Critique-Rethink-Verify (CRV) system, designed for training smaller yet powerful LRMs. Our CRV system consists of multiple LLM agents, each specializing in unique tasks: (i) critiquing the CoT rationales according to the cognitive capabilities of smaller models, (ii) rethinking and refining these CoTs based on the critiques, and (iii) verifying the correctness of the refined results. Building on the CRV system, we further propose the Cognitive Preference Optimization (CogPO) algorithm to continuously enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models by aligning their reasoning processes with their cognitive capacities. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our CRV+CogPO framework, which outperforms other methods by a large margin.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as human-like decision-making agents in social science and applied settings. These LLM-agents are typically assigned human-like characters and placed in real-life contexts. However, how these characters and contexts shape an LLM's behavior remains underexplored. This study proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying an LLM's internal representations in a Dictator Game -- a classic behavioral experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior. We extract "vectors of variable variations" (e.g., "male" to "female") from the LLM's internal state. Manipulating these vectors during the model's inference can substantially alter how those variables relate to the model's decision-making. This approach offers a principled way to study and regulate how social concepts can be encoded and engineered within transformer-based models, with implications for alignment, debiasing, and designing AI agents for social simulations in both academic and commercial applications, strengthening sociological theory and measurement.

Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are being actively explored in medicine, their ability to conduct complex real-world telemedicine consultations combining accurate diagnosis with professional dialogue remains underexplored. This paper presents 3MDBench (Medical Multimodal Multi-agent Dialogue Benchmark), an open-source framework for simulating and evaluating LVLM-driven telemedical consultations. 3MDBench simulates patient variability through temperament-based Patient Agent and evaluates diagnostic accuracy and dialogue quality via Assessor Agent. It includes 2996 cases across 34 diagnoses from real-world telemedicine interactions, combining textual and image-based data. The experimental study compares diagnostic strategies for widely used open and closed-source LVLMs. We demonstrate that multimodal dialogue with internal reasoning improves F1 score by 6.5% over non-dialogue settings, highlighting the importance of context-aware, information-seeking questioning. Moreover, injecting predictions from a diagnostic convolutional neural network into the LVLM's context boosts F1 by up to 20%. Source code is available at https://github.com/univanxx/3mdbench.

Abstract: LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex, agentic tasks, from generating high-quality presentation slides to even conducting sophisticated scientific research. Meanwhile, RL has been widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence, but limited research has investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using foundational RL techniques. Moreover, the direct application of MARL methods to LaMAS introduces significant challenges, stemming from the unique characteristics and mechanisms inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges, this article presents a comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a novel paradigm termed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We introduce a brand-new MG called Flex-MG, which aligns with the LaMAS optimization in real-world applications and a universal algorithmic framework tailored specifically for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations, key distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We review the evolution from RL to RFT, setting the stage for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we elucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences motivate a transition toward a LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT. Central to this work is a robust and scalable MARFT framework. We detail the core algorithm and provide a complete, open-source implementation to facilitate adoption and further research. The latter sections of the paper explore real-world application perspectives and opening challenges in MARFT. By bridging theoretical underpinnings with practical methodologies, this work serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to advance MARFT toward resilient and adaptive solutions in agentic systems. Our implementation of the proposed framework is publicly available at: https://github.com/jwliao-ai/MARFT.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path-Finding (MAPF) focuses on the collaborative planning of paths for multiple agents within shared spaces, aiming for collision-free navigation. Conventional planning methods often overlook the presence of other agents, which can result in conflicts. In response, this article introduces the A$^*_+$T algorithm, a distributed approach that improves coordination among agents by anticipating their positions based on their movement speeds. The algorithm also considers dynamic obstacles, assessing potential collisions with respect to observed speeds and trajectories, thereby facilitating collision-free path planning in environments populated by other agents and moving objects. It incorporates a risk layer surrounding both dynamic and static entities, enhancing its utility in real-world applications. Each agent functions autonomously while being mindful of the paths chosen by others, effectively addressing the complexities inherent in multi-agent situations. The performance of A$^*_+$T has been rigorously tested in the Gazebo simulation environment and benchmarked against established approaches such as CBS, ECBS, and SIPP. Furthermore, the algorithm has shown competence in single-agent experiments, with results demonstrating its effectiveness in managing dynamic obstacles and affirming its practical relevance across various scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging the agentic paradigm of large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved Text-to-SQL capabilities, empowering users without specialized database knowledge to intuitively query databases. However, deploying agentic LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems in production presents significant challenges, stemming from their inherently multi-stage computational dependencies, strict latency requirements, and the complexity of deployment across heterogeneous GPUs widely existing in enterprise clusters. Meanwhile, existing LLM serving frameworks are primarily designed for independent inference tasks, resulting in suboptimal performance and frequent service-level objective (SLO) violations in Text-to-SQL workloads. In this paper, we introduce HEXGEN-FLOW, a novel framework designed explicitly to schedule and execute agentic multi-stage LLM-based Text-to-SQL workflows on heterogeneous GPU clusters serving multi-tenant Text-to-SQL requests. HEXGEN-FLOW introduces a hierarchical scheduling approach that combines global workload-balanced task dispatching with an adaptive local priority queue, guided by a systematic analysis of agentic Text-to-SQL workflows. Additionally, we propose a lightweight simulation-based method for tuning critical scheduling hyperparameters, further enhancing robustness and adaptability. Our evaluation on realistic Text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrates that HEXGEN-FLOW significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM serving frameworks. Across all traces, HEXGEN-FLOW reduces P95 tail latency by $1.42{\sim}1.56\times$ and increases throughput by $1.49{\sim}1.81\times$, demonstrating robust improvements under diverse workloads. Our code is available at https://github.com/Relaxed-System-Lab/Hexgen-Flow.

Abstract: With the emergence of large model-based agents, widely adopted transformer-based architectures inevitably produce excessively long token embeddings for transmission, which may result in high bandwidth overhead, increased power consumption and latency. In this letter, we propose a task-oriented multimodal token transmission scheme for efficient multimodal information fusion and utilization. To improve the efficiency of token transmission, we design a two-stage training algotithm, including cross-modal alignment and task-oriented fine-tuning, for large model-based token communication. Meanwhile, token compression is performed using a sliding window pooling operation to save communication resources. To balance the trade-off between latency and model performance caused by compression, we formulate a weighted-sum optimization problem over latency and validation loss. We jointly optimizes bandwidth, power allocation, and token length across users by using an alternating optimization method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline under different bandwidth and power budgets. Moreover, the two-stage training algorithm achieves higher accuracy across various signal-to-noise ratios than the method without cross-modal alignment.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are increasingly used to bridge language and action in embodied agents, yet the operational characteristics of different FM integration strategies remain under-explored -- particularly for complex instruction following and versatile action generation in changing environments. This paper examines three paradigms for building robotic systems: end-to-end vision-language-action (VLA) models that implicitly integrate perception and planning, and modular pipelines incorporating either vision-language models (VLMs) or multimodal large language models (LLMs). We evaluate these paradigms through two focused case studies: a complex instruction grounding task assessing fine-grained instruction understanding and cross-modal disambiguation, and an object manipulation task targeting skill transfer via VLA finetuning. Our experiments in zero-shot and few-shot settings reveal trade-offs in generalization and data efficiency. By exploring performance limits, we distill design implications for developing language-driven physical agents and outline emerging challenges and opportunities for FM-powered robotics in real-world conditions.

<title>Towards Robust Evaluation of STEM Education: Leveraging MLLMs in Project-Based Learning</title>

Abstract: Project-Based Learning (PBL) involves a variety of highly correlated multimodal data, making it a vital educational approach within STEM disciplines. With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have begun exploring their potential to enhance tasks such as information retrieval, knowledge comprehension, and data generation in educational settings. However, existing benchmarks fall short in providing both a free-form output structure and a rigorous human expert validation process, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating real-world educational tasks. Additionally, few methods have developed automated pipelines to assist with the complex responsibilities of teachers leveraging MLLMs, largely due to model hallucination and instability, which lead to unreliable implementation. To address this gap, we introduce PBLBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate complex reasoning grounded in domain-specific knowledge and long-context understanding, thereby challenging models with tasks that closely resemble those handled by human experts. To establish reliable ground truth, we adopt the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), utilizing expert-driven pairwise comparisons to derive structured and weighted evaluation criteria. We assess the performance of 15 leading MLLMs/LLMs using PBLBench and demonstrate that even the most advanced models achieve only 59% rank accuracy, underscoring the significant challenges presented by this benchmark. We believe PBLBench will serve as a catalyst for the development of more capable AI agents, ultimately aiming to alleviate teacher workload and enhance educational productivity.

<title>Reflectance Prediction-based Knowledge Distillation for Robust 3D Object Detection in Compressed Point Clouds</title>

Abstract: Regarding intelligent transportation systems, low-bitrate transmission via lossy point cloud compression is vital for facilitating real-time collaborative perception among connected agents, such as vehicles and infrastructures, under restricted bandwidth. In existing compression transmission systems, the sender lossily compresses point coordinates and reflectance to generate a transmission code stream, which faces transmission burdens from reflectance encoding and limited detection robustness due to information loss. To address these issues, this paper proposes a 3D object detection framework with reflectance prediction-based knowledge distillation (RPKD). We compress point coordinates while discarding reflectance during low-bitrate transmission, and feed the decoded non-reflectance compressed point clouds into a student detector. The discarded reflectance is then reconstructed by a geometry-based reflectance prediction (RP) module within the student detector for precise detection. A teacher detector with the same structure as the student detector is designed for performing reflectance knowledge distillation (RKD) and detection knowledge distillation (DKD) from raw to compressed point clouds. Our cross-source distillation training strategy (CDTS) equips the student detector with robustness to low-quality compressed data while preserving the accuracy benefits of raw data through transferred distillation knowledge. Experimental results on the KITTI and DAIR-V2X-V datasets demonstrate that our method can boost detection accuracy for compressed point clouds across multiple code rates. We will release the code publicly at https://github.com/HaoJing-SX/RPKD.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery (DVD) agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Unlike previous video agents that rely on predefined workflows applied uniformly across different queries, our approach emphasizes the autonomous and adaptive nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools to orchestrate adaptive workflow for different queries in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates our advantage. Our DVD agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging LVBench dataset, reaching an accuracy of 74.2%, which substantially surpasses all prior works, and further improves to 76.0% with transcripts. The code has been released at https://github.com/microsoft/DeepVideoDiscovery.

Abstract: We present AIOS 1.0, a novel platform designed to advance computer-use agent (CUA) capabilities through environmental contextualization. While existing approaches primarily focus on building more powerful agent frameworks or enhancing agent models, we identify a fundamental limitation: the semantic disconnect between how language models understand the world and how computer interfaces are structured. AIOS 1.0 addresses this challenge by transforming computers into contextual environments that language models can natively comprehend, implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server architecture to abstract computer states and actions. This approach effectively decouples interface complexity from decision complexity, enabling agents to reason more effectively about computing environments. To demonstrate our platform's effectiveness, we introduce LiteCUA, a lightweight computer-use agent built on AIOS 1.0 that achieves a 14.66% success rate on the OSWorld benchmark, outperforming several specialized agent frameworks despite its simple architecture. Our results suggest that contextualizing computer environments for language models represents a promising direction for developing more capable computer-use agents and advancing toward AI that can interact with digital systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) systems have countless applications, from energy-grid management to protein design. However, such real-world scenarios are often extremely difficult, combinatorial in nature, and require complex coordination between multiple agents. This level of complexity can cause even state-of-the-art RL systems, trained until convergence, to hit a performance ceiling which they are unable to break out of with zero-shot inference. Meanwhile, many digital or simulation-based applications allow for an inference phase that utilises a specific time and compute budget to explore multiple attempts before outputting a final solution. In this work, we show that such an inference phase employed at execution time, and the choice of a corresponding inference strategy, are key to breaking the performance ceiling observed in complex multi-agent RL problems. Our main result is striking: we can obtain up to a 126% and, on average, a 45% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art across 17 tasks, using only a couple seconds of extra wall-clock time during execution. We also demonstrate promising compute scaling properties, supported by over 60k experiments, making it the largest study on inference strategies for complex RL to date. Our experimental data and code are available at https://sites.google.com/view/inference-strategies-rl.

Abstract: External knowledge has played a crucial role in the recent development of computer use agents. We identify a critical knowledge-execution gap: retrieved knowledge often fails to translate into effective real-world task execution. Our analysis shows even 90% correct knowledge yields only 41% execution success rate. To bridge this gap, we propose UI-Evol, a plug-and-play module for autonomous GUI knowledge evolution. UI-Evol consists of two stages: a Retrace Stage that extracts faithful objective action sequences from actual agent-environment interactions, and a Critique Stage that refines existing knowledge by comparing these sequences against external references. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the OSWorld benchmark with the state-of-the-art Agent S2. Our results demonstrate that UI-Evol not only significantly boosts task performance but also addresses a previously overlooked issue of high behavioral standard deviation in computer use agents, leading to superior performance on computer use tasks and substantially improved agent reliability.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred transformative applications in various domains, ranging from open-source to proprietary LLMs. However, jailbreak attacks, which aim to break safety alignment and user compliance by tricking the target LLMs into answering harmful and risky responses, are becoming an urgent concern. The practice of red-teaming for LLMs is to proactively explore potential risks and error-prone instances before the release of frontier AI technology. This paper proposes an agentic workflow to automate and scale the red-teaming process of LLMs through the Composition-of-Principles (CoP) framework, where human users provide a set of red-teaming principles as instructions to an AI agent to automatically orchestrate effective red-teaming strategies and generate jailbreak prompts. Distinct from existing red-teaming methods, our CoP framework provides a unified and extensible framework to encompass and orchestrate human-provided red-teaming principles to enable the automated discovery of new red-teaming strategies. When tested against leading LLMs, CoP reveals unprecedented safety risks by finding novel jailbreak prompts and improving the best-known single-turn attack success rate by up to 19.0 times.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably $\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our analysis is carried out in the simplified single-agent setting, which allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as personal agents, accessing sensitive user data such as calendars, emails, and medical records. Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers, increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity. Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark, our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model, outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent collaboration highlights the power of structured communication in enabling collective intelligence. However, existing methods largely rely on static or graph-based inter-agent topologies, lacking the potential adaptability and flexibility in communication. In this work, we propose a new framework that rethinks multi-agent coordination through a sequential structure rather than a graph structure, offering a significantly larger topology space for multi-agent communication. Our method focuses on two key directions: (1) Next-Agent Prediction, which selects the most suitable agent role at each step, and (2) Next-Context Selection (NCS), which enables each agent to selectively access relevant information from any previous step. Together, these components construct task-adaptive communication pipelines that support both role flexibility and global information flow. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance while substantially reducing communication overhead.

Abstract: Markov games with coupling constraints provide a natural framework to study constrained decision-making involving self-interested agents, where the feasibility of an individual agent's strategy depends on the joint strategies of the others. Such games arise in numerous real-world applications involving safety requirements and budget caps, for example, in environmental management, electricity markets, and transportation systems. While correlated equilibria have emerged as an important solution concept in unconstrained settings due to their computational tractability and amenability to learning, their constrained counterparts remain less explored. In this paper, we study constrained correlated equilibria-feasible policies where any unilateral modifications are either unprofitable or infeasible. We first characterize the constrained correlated equilibrium showing that different sets of modifications result in an equivalent notion, a result which may enable efficient learning algorithms. We then address existence conditions. In particular, we show that a strong Slater-type condition is necessary in games with playerwise coupling constraints, but can be significantly weakened when all players share common coupling constraints. Under this relaxed condition, we prove the existence of a constrained correlated equilibrium.

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction, functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1 70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility, workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage remained minimal (less than 20%). Code compatibility peaked at 100% under specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50% for MAS. Only the reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes) whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

Abstract: The openness of social media enables the free exchange of opinions, but it also presents challenges in guiding opinion evolution towards global consensus. Existing methods often directly modify user views or enforce cross-group connections. These intrusive interventions undermine user autonomy, provoke psychological resistance, and reduce the efficiency of global consensus. Additionally, due to the lack of a long-term perspective, promoting local consensus often exacerbates divisions at the macro level. To address these issues, we propose the hierarchical, non-intrusive opinion guidance framework, H-NeiFi. It first establishes a two-layer dynamic model based on social roles, considering the behavioral characteristics of both experts and non-experts. Additionally, we introduce a non-intrusive neighbor filtering method that adaptively controls user communication channels. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), we optimize information propagation paths through a long-term reward function, avoiding direct interference with user interactions. Experiments show that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed by 22.0% to 30.7% and maintains global convergence even in the absence of experts. This approach enables natural and efficient consensus guidance by protecting user interaction autonomy, offering a new paradigm for social network governance.

Abstract: Scientific progress in Earth science depends on integrating data across the planet's interconnected spheres. However, the accelerating volume and fragmentation of multi-sphere knowledge and data have surpassed human analytical capacity. This creates a major bottleneck for discovery, especially in climate science. To address this challenge, we introduce EarthLink, the first self-evolving AI agent system designed as an interactive "copilot" for Earth scientists. Through natural language interaction, EarthLink automates the entire research workflow by integrating planning, code execution, data analysis, and physical reasoning into a unified process that directly addresses this limitation. Beyond efficiency, it exhibits human-like cross-disciplinary analytical ability and achieves proficiency comparable to a junior researcher in expert evaluations on core large-scale climate tasks, including model-observation comparison and climate change understanding. When tasked with an open scientific problem, specifically the discovery of precursors of the Atlantic Ni\~no, EarthLink autonomously developed a research strategy, identified sources of predictability, verified its hypotheses with available data, and proposed a physically consistent mechanism. These emerging capabilities enable a new human-AI research paradigm. Scientists can focus on value and result judgments, while AI systems handle complex data analysis and knowledge integration. This accelerates the pace and breadth of discovery in Earth sciences. The system is accessible at our website https://earthlink.intern-ai.org.cn.

Abstract: Human mobility forms the backbone of contact patterns through which infectious diseases propagate, fundamentally shaping the spatio-temporal dynamics of epidemics and pandemics. While traditional models are often based on the assumption that all individuals have the same probability of infecting every other individual in the population, a so-called random homogeneous mixing, they struggle to capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of real-world human interactions. Recent advancements in data-driven methodologies and computational capabilities have unlocked the potential of integrating high-resolution human mobility data into epidemic modeling, significantly improving the accuracy, timeliness, and applicability of epidemic risk assessment, contact tracing, and intervention strategies. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current landscape in human mobility-informed epidemic modeling. We explore diverse sources and representations of human mobility data, and then examine the behavioral and structural roles of mobility and contact in shaping disease transmission dynamics. Furthermore, the review spans a wide range of epidemic modeling approaches, ranging from classical compartmental models to network-based, agent-based, and machine learning models. And we also discuss how mobility integration enhances risk management and response strategies during epidemics. By synthesizing these insights, the review can serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, bridging the gap between epidemiological theory and the dynamic complexities of human interaction while charting clear directions for future research.

Abstract: Online behavioural research faces an emerging threat as participants increasingly turn to large language models (LLMs) for advice, translation, or task delegation: LLM Pollution. We identify three interacting variants through which LLM Pollution threatens the validity and integrity of online behavioural research. First, Partial LLM Mediation occurs when participants make selective use of LLMs for specific aspects of a task, such as translation or wording support, leading researchers to (mis)interpret LLM-shaped outputs as human ones. Second, Full LLM Delegation arises when agentic LLMs complete studies with little to no human oversight, undermining the central premise of human-subject research at a more foundational level. Third, LLM Spillover signifies human participants altering their behaviour as they begin to anticipate LLM presence in online studies, even when none are involved. While Partial Mediation and Full Delegation form a continuum of increasing automation, LLM Spillover reflects second-order reactivity effects. Together, these variants interact and generate cascading distortions that compromise sample authenticity, introduce biases that are difficult to detect post hoc, and ultimately undermine the epistemic grounding of online research on human cognition and behaviour. Crucially, the threat of LLM Pollution is already co-evolving with advances in generative AI, creating an escalating methodological arms race. To address this, we propose a multi-layered response spanning researcher practices, platform accountability, and community efforts. As the challenge evolves, coordinated adaptation will be essential to safeguard methodological integrity and preserve the validity of online behavioural research.

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs, coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance. The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with respect to those contracts.

<title>Imperfect Competition in Markets for Short-Circuit Current Services</title>

Abstract: An important limitation of Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) is their reduced contribution to Short-Circuit Current (SCC), as compared to that of Synchronous Generators (SGs). With increasing penetration of IBR in most power systems, the reducing SCC poses challenges to a secure system operation, as line protections may not trip when required. In order to address this issue, the SCC ancillary service could be procured via an economic mechanism, aiming at securing adequate SCC on all buses. However, the suitability of markets for SCC services is not well understood, given that these could be prone to market-power issues: since the SCC contributions from various SGs to a certain bus are determined by the electrical topology of the grid, this is a highly local service. It is necessary to understand if SGs at advantageous electrical locations could exert market power and, if so, how it could be mitigated. In order to fill this gap, this paper adopts an SCC-constrained bilevel model to investigate strategic behaviors of SGs. To address the non-convexity due to unit commitment variables, the model is restructured through a primal-dual formulation. Based on a modified IEEE 30-bus system, cases with strategic SGs placed at different buses are analyzed. These studies demonstrate that agents exerting market power could achieve up to triple revenues from SCC provision, highlighting the need to carefully design these markets.

Abstract: Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling, tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey). Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty, grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable evidence and credible outcomes.

Abstract: Open Agent Specification (Agent Spec) is a declarative language for defining AI agents and workflows in a way that is compatible across different AI frameworks, promoting portability and interoperability within AI Agent frameworks. Agent Spec aims to resolve the challenges of fragmented agent development by providing a common unified specification that allows AI agents to be designed once and deployed across various frameworks, improving interoperability and reusability, while reducing redundant efforts. Additionally, Agent Spec facilitates development tools and portability, allowing AI agents to be defined independently of their execution environment and enabling teams to exchange solutions without implementation-specific limitations. Agent Spec benefits four key groups: (i) Agent developers, who gain a superset of reusable components and design patterns, enabling them to leverage a broader range of functionalities; (ii) Agent framework and tool developers, who can use Agent Spec as an interchange format and therefore benefit from cross-framework and tool support; (iii) Researchers, who can achieve reproducible results and comparability, facilitating more reliable and consistent outcomes; (iv) Enterprises, which see faster prototype-to-deployment, increased productivity, and greater scalability and maintainability for their AI agent solutions. This technical report provides an overview of the technical foundations of Agent Spec, including motivation, benefits, and future work. We also introduce a standardized Evaluation harness to assess agent behavior and agentic workflows across runtimes (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, and WayFlow), using three different benchmarks (SimpleQA Verified, $\tau^2$-Bench and BIRD-SQL) - analogous to how HELM and related harnesses standardized LLM evaluation - so that performance, robustness, and efficiency can be compared consistently across frameworks.

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems are increasingly adopted for complex language processing tasks that require communication and coordination among agents. However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from repeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical pipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full context-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to inefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution for avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes remain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to diverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify that the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents. To address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables efficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning cache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM estimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of cached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under varying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing dynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM achieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including retrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks, all without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent receives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a five-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard prefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms.

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable inferences and validate them via two instantiation. This theory offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.

Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences, they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex, open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has been driven by insights from physics and neuroscience, particularly through the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) capable of complex cognitive tasks such as vision and language processing. Despite these advances, they struggle with continual learning, adaptable knowledge transfer, robustness, and resource efficiency -- capabilities that biological systems handle seamlessly. Specifically, neuromorphic systems and artificial neural networks often overlook two key biophysical properties of neural circuits: neuronal diversity and cell-specific neuromodulation. These mechanisms, essential for regulating dynamic learning across brain scales, allow neuromodulators to introduce degeneracy in biological neural networks, ensuring stability and adaptability under changing conditions. In this article, we summarize recent bioinspired models, learning rules, and architectures, and propose a framework for augmenting ANNs, which has the potential to bridge the gap between neuroscience and AI through neurobiological first principles. Our proposed dual-framework approach leverages spiking neural networks to emulate diverse spiking behaviors and dendritic compartmental dynamics, thereby simulating the morphological and functional diversity of neuronal computations. Finally, we outline how integrating these biophysical principles into task-driven spiking neural networks and neuromorphic systems provides scalable solutions for continual learning, adaptability, robustness, and resource-efficiency. Additionally, this approach will not only provide insights into how emergent behaviors arise in neural networks but also catalyze the development of more efficient, reliable, and intelligent neuromorphic systems and robotic agents.

Abstract: We present a novel three-stage framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) within a risk-aware multi-agent system for automate strategy finding in quantitative finance. Our approach addresses the brittleness of traditional deep learning models in financial applications by: employing prompt-engineered LLMs to generate executable alpha factor candidates across diverse financial data, implementing multimodal agent-based evaluation that filters factors based on market status, predictive quality while maintaining category balance, and deploying dynamic weight optimization that adapts to market conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the robust performance of the strategy in Chinese & US market regimes compared to established benchmarks. Our work extends LLMs capabilities to quantitative trading, providing a scalable architecture for financial signal extraction and portfolio construction. The overall framework significantly outperforms all benchmarks with 53.17% cumulative return on SSE50 (Jan 2023 to Jan 2024), demonstrating superior risk-adjusted performance and downside protection on the market.

Abstract: This study investigates the development of an optimal execution strategy through reinforcement learning, aiming to determine the most effective approach for traders to buy and sell inventory within a finite time horizon. Our proposed model leverages input features derived from the current state of the limit order book and operates at a high frequency to maximize control. To simulate this environment and overcome the limitations associated with relying on historical data, we utilize the multi-agent market simulator ABIDES, which provides a diverse range of depth levels within the limit order book. We present a custom MDP formulation followed by the results of our methodology and benchmark the performance against standard execution strategies. Results show that the reinforcement learning agent outperforms standard strategies and offers a practical foundation for real-world trading applications.

Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $N$ vertices. Let $k$ be the number of vertices in a longest path of $G$ such that every vertex on the path is a cut vertex of $G$, and every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $G$. We conventionally set $k = 1$ when $G$ is $2$-edge-connected. Let $P=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ be a set of pebbles with $k < N-n$. A \textit{configuration} of $P$ on $G$ is defined as a function $f$ from $V(G)$ to $\{0, 1, \ldots, n \}$ with $|f^{-1}(i)| = 1$ for $1 \le i \le n$, where $f^{-1}(i)$ is a vertex occupied with the $i$th pebble for $1 \le i \le n$ and $f^{-1}(0)$ is a set of unoccupied vertices. A \textit{move} is defined as shifting a pebble from a vertex to some unoccupied neighbor. The {\it pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$} is to decide whether a given configuration of pebbles is reachable from another by executing a sequence of moves. Let $\D(G)$ denote the diameter of the graph $G$, and let $\CL(G)$ denote the maximum length of a shortest cycle containing a vertex $v$, taken over all vertices $v$ in all $2$-connected components of $G$. For completeness, we define $\CL(G) := 1$ when $G$ is a tree. In this paper, we show that the length of the shortest solution sequences for the pebble motion problem on a pair $(G, P)$ is in $\Ord\left(n\D(G) + \min\left\{k n \D(G),\ n^{2} \log\big(1+\min\{n, k\}\big)\right\}\right)$ if $G$ is an $N$-vertex tree, and in $\Ord\left(n\D(G)+\frac{n^2\min\{n,\CL(G)\}}{N-n}+n^2\log(1+\min\{n, N-n\})\right)$ if $G$ is a connected general $N$-vertex graph. Furthermore, in the case where $G$ is a connected general $N$-vertex graph and the number of unoccupied spaces $N - n$ is bounded by some constant, this length admits an upper bound of $\Ord(n \CL(G) \D(G))$.

Abstract: Networked environments shape how information embedded in narratives influences individual and group beliefs and behavior. This raises key questions about how group communication around narrative media impacts belief formation and how such mechanisms contribute to the emergence of consensus or polarization. Language data from generative agents offer insight into how naturalistic forms of narrative interactions (such as hashtag generation) evolve in response to social rewards within networked communication settings. To investigate this, we developed an agent-based modeling and simulation framework composed of networks of interacting Large Language Model (LLM) agents. We benchmarked the simulations of four state-of-the-art LLMs against human group behaviors observed in a prior network experiment (Study 1) and against naturally occurring hashtags from Twitter (Study 2). Quantitative metrics of network coherence (e.g., entropy of a group's responses) reveal that while LLMs can approximate human-like coherence in sanitized domains (Study 1's experimental data), effective integration of background knowledge and social context in more complex or politically sensitive narratives likely requires careful and structured prompting.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools. However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability, including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring. By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities. Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and strategy coding.

<title>Inverse Knowledge Search over Verifiable Reasoning: Synthesizing a Scientific Encyclopedia from a Long Chains-of-Thought Knowledge Base</title>

Abstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven, reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200 courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search -- retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval (as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base, this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding encyclopedia.

Abstract: We present Denario, an AI multi-agent system designed to serve as a scientific research assistant. Denario can perform many different tasks, such as generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans, writing and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a scientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle specific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end scientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we describe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by presenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical informatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine, neuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from different disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies methods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We report the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who provided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we discuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such technology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code at https://github.com/AstroPilot-AI/Denario. A Denario demo can also be run directly on the web at https://huggingface.co/spaces/astropilot-ai/Denario, and the full app will be deployed on the cloud.

<title>Design for One, Deploy for Many: Navigating Tree Mazes with Multiple Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26900</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.26900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maze-like environments, such as cave and pipe networks, pose unique challenges for multiple robots to coordinate, including communication constraints and congestion. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed multi-agent maze traversal algorithm for environments that can be represented by acyclic graphs. It uses a leader-switching mechanism where one agent, assuming a head role, employs any single-agent maze solver while the other agents each choose an agent to follow. The head role gets transferred to neighboring agents where necessary, ensuring it follows the same path as a single agent would. The multi-agent maze traversal algorithm is evaluated in simulations with groups of up to 300 agents, various maze sizes, and multiple single-agent maze solvers. It is compared against strategies that are na\"ive, or assume either global communication or full knowledge of the environment. The algorithm outperforms the na\"ive strategy in terms of makespan and sum-of-fuel. It is superior to the global-communication strategy in terms of makespan but is inferior to it in terms of sum-of-fuel. The findings suggest it is asymptotically equivalent to the full-knowledge strategy with respect to either metric. Moreover, real-world experiments with up to 20 Pi-puck robots confirm the feasibility of the approach.

<title>FlowMesh: A Service Fabric for Composable LLM Workflows</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26913</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26913</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.26913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI deployment increasingly resembles a pipeline of data transformation, fine-tuning, and agent interactions rather than a monolithic LLM job; recent examples include RLHF/RLAIF training and agentic workflows. To cope with this shift, we propose FlowMesh, a multi-tenant service fabric that executes and optimizes these workloads as one shared service instead of isolated pipelines. It decomposes workflows into fine-grained operators with recorded lineage, enabling de-duplication of work across users and batching requests on the same hardware while preserving per-workflow provenance. A global control plane maintains a cluster-wide pool of ready operators and uses a single utility function to pick both the batch and the worker, balancing throughput, cost, and data locality on heterogeneous GPUs. The data plane is an elastic fleet of stateless workers backed by a content-addressable store, enabling rapid, automatic scale-out, safe retry after preemption, and portability across managed clusters such as Kubernetes and geo-distributed GPU marketplaces such as Vast.ai. Compared with baseline solutions, FlowMesh achieves up to 3.8x cost reduction and 2.0x lower energy usage, provides a similar or better latency profile, and remains efficient under dynamic and failure-prone conditions.

<title>Cooperative Integrated Estimation-Guidance for Simultaneous Interception of Moving Targets</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26948</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26948</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.26948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a cooperative integrated estimation-guidance framework for simultaneous interception of a non-maneuvering target using a team of unmanned autonomous vehicles, assuming only a subset of vehicles are equipped with dedicated sensors to measure the target's states. Unlike earlier approaches that focus solely on either estimation or guidance design, the proposed framework unifies both within a cooperative architecture. To circumvent the limitation posed by heterogeneity in target observability, sensorless vehicles estimate the target's state by leveraging information exchanged with neighboring agents over a directed communication topology through a prescribed-time observer. The proposed approach employs true proportional navigation guidance (TPNG), which uses an exact time-to-go formulation and is applicable across a wide spectrum of target motions. Furthermore, prescribed-time observer and controller are employed to achieve convergence to true target's state and consensus in time-to-go within set predefined times, respectively. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework under various engagement scenarios.

<title>Semantically-Aware LLM Agent to Enhance Privacy in Conversational AI Services</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27016</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27016</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.27016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing use of conversational AI systems, there is growing concern over privacy leaks, especially when users share sensitive personal data in interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). Conversations shared with these models may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which, if exposed, could lead to security breaches or identity theft. To address this challenge, we present the Local Optimizations for Pseudonymization with Semantic Integrity Directed Entity Detection (LOPSIDED) framework, a semantically-aware privacy agent designed to safeguard sensitive PII data when using remote LLMs. Unlike prior work that often degrade response quality, our approach dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with semantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving the contextual integrity of conversations. Once the model generates its response, the pseudonyms are automatically depseudonymized, ensuring the user receives an accurate, privacy-preserving output. We evaluate our approach using real-world conversations sourced from ShareGPT, which we further augment and annotate to assess whether named entities are contextually relevant to the model's response. Our results show that LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a factor of 5 compared to baseline techniques, all while enhancing privacy.

<title>Incremental Human-Object Interaction Detection with Invariant Relation Representation Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27020</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.27020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models. Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs.

Abstract: Enterprise AI agents must continuously adapt to maintain accuracy, reduce latency, and remain aligned with user needs. We present a practical implementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a MAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically addresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and enables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we monitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two major failure modes: routing errors (5.25\%) and query rephrasal errors (3.2\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements through fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a fine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size, and 70\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\% gain in accuracy and a 40\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel, transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings include approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback, navigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production. This work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive enterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.27094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity, and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process. We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows, and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code, data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

Abstract: With powerful and integrative large language models (LLMs), medical AI agents have demonstrated unique advantages in providing personalized medical consultations, continuous health monitoring, and precise treatment plans. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates personal medical documents into LLMs by an external retrievable database to address the costly retraining or fine-tuning issues in deploying customized agents. While deploying medical agents in edge devices ensures privacy protection, RAG implementations impose substantial memory access and energy consumption during the retrieval stage. This paper presents a hierarchical retrieval architecture for edge RAG, leveraging a two-stage retrieval scheme that combines approximate retrieval for candidate set generation, followed by high-precision retrieval on pre-selected document embeddings. The proposed architecture significantly reduces energy consumption and external memory access while maintaining retrieval accuracy. Simulation results show that, under TSMC 28nm technology, the proposed hierarchical retrieval architecture has reduced the overall memory access by nearly 50% and the computation by 75% compared to pure INT8 retrieval, and the total energy consumption for 1 MB data retrieval is 177.76 {\mu}J/query.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are emerging as transformative tools in drug discovery, with the ability to autonomously reason, act, and learn through complicated research workflows. Building on large language models (LLMs) coupled with perception, computation, action, and memory tools, these agentic AI systems could integrate diverse biomedical data, execute tasks, carry out experiments via robotic platforms, and iteratively refine hypotheses in closed loops. We provide a conceptual and technical overview of agentic AI architectures, ranging from ReAct and Reflection to Supervisor and Swarm systems, and illustrate their applications across key stages of drug discovery, including literature synthesis, toxicity prediction, automated protocol generation, small-molecule synthesis, drug repurposing, and end-to-end decision-making. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive work to present real-world implementations and quantifiable impacts of agentic AI systems deployed in operational drug discovery settings. Early implementations demonstrate substantial gains in speed, reproducibility, and scalability, compressing workflows that once took months into hours while maintaining scientific traceability. We discuss the current challenges related to data heterogeneity, system reliability, privacy, and benchmarking, and outline future directions towards technology in support of science and translation.

<title>Measuring the Security of Mobile LLM Agents under Adversarial Prompts from Untrusted Third-Party Channels</title>

arXiv:2510.27140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed software development, enabling AI-powered applications known as LLM-based agents that promise to automate tasks across diverse apps and workflows. Yet, the security implications of deploying such agents in adversarial mobile environments remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of security risks in mobile LLM agents. We design and evaluate a suite of adversarial case studies, ranging from opportunistic manipulations such as pop-up advertisements to advanced, end-to-end workflows involving malware installation and cross-app data exfiltration. Our evaluation covers eight state-of-the-art mobile agents across three architectures, with over 2,000 adversarial and paired benign trials. The results reveal systemic vulnerabilities: low-barrier vectors such as fraudulent ads succeed with over 80% reliability, while even workflows requiring the circumvention of operating-system warnings, such as malware installation, are consistently completed by advanced multi-app agents. By mapping these attacks to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Mobile framework, we uncover novel privilege-escalation and persistence pathways unique to LLM-driven automation. Collectively, our findings provide the first end-to-end evidence that mobile LLM agents are exploitable in realistic adversarial settings, where untrusted third-party channels (e.g., ads, embedded webviews, cross-app notifications) are an inherent part of the mobile ecosystem.

<title>A Survey on Generative Recommendation: Data, Model, and Tasks</title>

Abstract: Recommender systems serve as foundational infrastructure in modern information ecosystems, helping users navigate digital content and discover items aligned with their preferences. At their core, recommender systems address a fundamental problem: matching users with items. Over the past decades, the field has experienced successive paradigm shifts, from collaborative filtering and matrix factorization in the machine learning era to neural architectures in the deep learning era. Recently, the emergence of generative models, especially large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, have sparked a new paradigm: generative recommendation, which reconceptualizes recommendation as a generation task rather than discriminative scoring. This survey provides a comprehensive examination through a unified tripartite framework spanning data, model, and task dimensions. Rather than simply categorizing works, we systematically decompose approaches into operational stages-data augmentation and unification, model alignment and training, task formulation and execution. At the data level, generative models enable knowledge-infused augmentation and agent-based simulation while unifying heterogeneous signals. At the model level, we taxonomize LLM-based methods, large recommendation models, and diffusion approaches, analyzing their alignment mechanisms and innovations. At the task level, we illuminate new capabilities including conversational interaction, explainable reasoning, and personalized content generation. We identify five key advantages: world knowledge integration, natural language understanding, reasoning capabilities, scaling laws, and creative generation. We critically examine challenges in benchmark design, model robustness, and deployment efficiency, while charting a roadmap toward intelligent recommendation assistants that fundamentally reshape human-information interaction.

Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the creativity and reasoning of human experts? We present Glia, an AI architecture for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning, experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for complex systems problems.

arXiv:2510.27196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of memes on social media necessitates the capabilities of multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) to effectively understand multimodal harmfulness. Existing evaluation approaches predominantly focus on mLLMs' detection accuracy for binary classification tasks, which often fail to reflect the in-depth interpretive nuance of harmfulness across diverse contexts. In this paper, we propose MemeArena, an agent-based arena-style evaluation framework that provides a context-aware and unbiased assessment for mLLMs' understanding of multimodal harmfulness. Specifically, MemeArena simulates diverse interpretive contexts to formulate evaluation tasks that elicit perspective-specific analyses from mLLMs. By integrating varied viewpoints and reaching consensus among evaluators, it enables fair and unbiased comparisons of mLLMs' abilities to interpret multimodal harmfulness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces the evaluation biases of judge agents, with judgment results closely aligning with human preferences, offering valuable insights into reliable and comprehensive mLLM evaluations in multimodal harmfulness understanding. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/Lbotirx/MemeArena.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced GUI navigation agents, current approaches face limitations in cross-domain generalization and effective history utilization. We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that systematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history summarization. The structured reasoning component generates coherent Chain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning, which inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries for future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent, \textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled trajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework employs specialized rewards, including a history-aware objective, directly linking summary quality to subsequent action performance. Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art results under identical training data conditions, with particularly strong performance in out-of-domain scenarios. These findings validate our framework's ability to maintain robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI navigation tasks. Code is available at https://leon022.github.io/GUI-Rise.

<title>DRAMA: Unifying Data Retrieval and Analysis for Open-Domain Analytic Queries</title>

arXiv:2510.27238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manually conducting real-world data analyses is labor-intensive and inefficient. Despite numerous attempts to automate data science workflows, none of the existing paradigms or systems fully demonstrate all three key capabilities required to support them effectively: (1) open-domain data collection, (2) structured data transformation, and (3) analytic reasoning.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose DRAMA, an end-to-end paradigm that answers users' analytic queries in natural language on large-scale open-domain data. DRAMA unifies data collection, transformation, and analysis as a single pipeline. To quantitatively evaluate system performance on tasks representative of DRAMA, we construct a benchmark, DRAMA-Bench, consisting of two categories of tasks: claim verification and question answering, each comprising 100 instances. These tasks are derived from real-world applications that have gained significant public attention and require the retrieval and analysis of open-domain data. We develop DRAMA-Bot, a multi-agent system designed following DRAMA. It comprises a data retriever that collects and transforms data by coordinating the execution of sub-agents, and a data analyzer that performs structured reasoning over the retrieved data. We evaluate DRAMA-Bot on DRAMA-Bench together with five state-of-the-art baseline agents. DRAMA-Bot achieves 86.5% task accuracy at a cost of $0.05, outperforming all baselines with up to 6.9 times the accuracy and less than 1/6 of the cost. DRAMA is publicly available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/drama.

Abstract: The exceptional potential of large language models (LLMs) in handling text information has garnered significant attention in the field of financial trading. However, current trading agents primarily focus on single-step trading tasks and lack awareness of continuous position management. Therefore, we propose a position-aware trading task designed to simulate a more realistic market. To address this task, we develop a trading agent system, FinPos, optimized for position management. FinPos is able to interpret various types of market information from a professional perspective, providing a reliable basis for positioning decisions. To mitigate the substantial market risks arising from position fluctuations, FinPos employs dual decision agents. Furthermore, the continuous nature of position management necessitates our adoption of multi-timescale rewards, which in turn empowers FinPos to effectively balance short-term fluctuations against long-term trends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in the position-aware trading task, which closely mirrors real market conditions. More importantly, our findings reveal that LLM-centered agent systems exhibit a vast, largely unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making.

Abstract: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents rely on accurate GUI grounding, which maps language instructions to on-screen coordinates, to execute user commands. However, current models, whether trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), lack self-awareness of their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable predictions. We first systematically evaluate probabilistic and verbalized confidence in general and GUI-specific models, revealing a misalignment between confidence and actual accuracy, which is particularly critical in dynamic GUI automation tasks, where single errors can cause task failure. To address this, we propose HyperClick, a novel framework that enhances reliable GUI grounding through uncertainty calibration. HyperClick introduces a dual reward mechanism, combining a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based spatial confidence modeling, calibrated using the Brier score. This approach jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering introspective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge benchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence calibration and introspective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence and supports more reliable GUI automation.

Abstract: Enterprise systems are crucial for enhancing productivity and decision-making among employees and customers. Integrating LLM based systems into enterprise systems enables intelligent automation, personalized experiences, and efficient information retrieval, driving operational efficiency and strategic growth. However, developing and evaluating such systems is challenging due to the inherent complexity of enterprise environments, where data is fragmented across multiple sources and governed by sophisticated access controls. We present EnterpriseBench, a comprehensive benchmark that simulates enterprise settings, featuring 500 diverse tasks across software engineering, HR, finance, and administrative domains. Our benchmark uniquely captures key enterprise characteristics including data source fragmentation, access control hierarchies, and cross-functional workflows. Additionally, we provide a novel data generation pipeline that creates internally consistent enterprise tasks from organizational metadata. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLM agents demonstrate that even the most capable models achieve only 41.8% task completion, highlighting significant opportunities for improvement in enterprise-focused AI systems.

<title>A Digital Twin-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Vehicle-to-Grid Coordination</title>

Abstract: The coordination of large-scale, decentralised systems, such as a fleet of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in a Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) network, presents a significant challenge for modern control systems. While collaborative Digital Twins have been proposed as a solution to manage such systems without compromising the privacy of individual agents, deriving globally optimal control policies from the high-level information they share remains an open problem. This paper introduces Digital Twin Assisted Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DT-MADDPG) algorithm, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with a collaborative DT network. Our core contribution is a simulation-assisted learning algorithm where the centralised critic is enhanced by a predictive global model that is collaboratively built from the privacy-preserving data shared by individual DTs. This approach removes the need for collecting sensitive raw data at a centralised entity, a requirement of traditional multi-agent learning algorithms. Experimental results in a simulated V2G environment demonstrate that DT-MADDPG can achieve coordination performance comparable to the standard MADDPG algorithm while offering significant advantages in terms of data privacy and architectural decentralisation. This work presents a practical and robust framework for deploying intelligent, learning-based coordination in complex, real-world cyber-physical systems.

<title>Reinforcement Learning for Long-Horizon Unordered Tasks: From Boolean to Coupled Reward Machines</title>

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) inform reinforcement learning agents about the reward structure of the environment. This is particularly advantageous for complex non-Markovian tasks because agents with access to RMs can learn more efficiently from fewer samples. However, learning with RMs is ill-suited for long-horizon problems in which a set of subtasks can be executed in any order. In such cases, the amount of information to learn increases exponentially with the number of unordered subtasks. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to express complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are associated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3) Coupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda. Furthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages coupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM). Our experiments show that CoRM scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems with unordered subtasks.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities by autonomously integrating with external tools for collaborative reasoning. However, due to the inherently complex and diverse nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external tools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer consolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly output. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains, including VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up to +6.69% across all datasets.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive systematic survey of the application of natural language processing (NLP) along the entire battery life cycle, instead of one stage or method, and introduce a novel technical language processing (TLP) framework for the EU's proposed digital battery passport (DBP) and other general battery predictions. We follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method and employ three reputable databases or search engines, including Google Scholar, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore (IEEE Xplore), and Scopus. Consequently, we assessed 274 scientific papers before the critical review of the final 66 relevant papers. We publicly provide artifacts of the review for validation and reproducibility. The findings show that new NLP tasks are emerging in the battery domain, which facilitate materials discovery and other stages of the life cycle. Notwithstanding, challenges remain, such as the lack of standard benchmarks. Our proposed TLP framework, which incorporates agentic AI and optimized prompts, will be apt for tackling some of the challenges.

<title>Realistic pedestrian-driver interaction modelling using multi-agent RL with human perceptual-motor constraints</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27383</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.27383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human road user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or 'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints, two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for simulating realistic road user interactions.

<title>Dialogue as Discovery: Navigating Human Intent Through Principled Inquiry</title>

arXiv:2510.27410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental bottleneck in human-AI collaboration is the "intention expression gap," the difficulty for humans to effectively convey complex, high-dimensional thoughts to AI. This challenge often traps users in inefficient trial-and-error loops and is exacerbated by the diverse expertise levels of users. We reframe this problem from passive instruction following to a Socratic collaboration paradigm, proposing an agent that actively probes for information to resolve its uncertainty about user intent. we name the proposed agent Nous, trained to acquire proficiency in this inquiry policy. The core mechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of information theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from dialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to the reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward design enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or external reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated simulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the challenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments, including ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across user expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to varying user expertise. Moreover, its design is domain-agnostic, and we show evidence of generalization beyond diagram generation. Experimental results prove that our work offers a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for resolving uncertainty about user intent in complex human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs are a cornerstone of modern cloud native systems. Ensuring their reliability demands automated test suites that exercise diverse and boundary level behaviors. Nevertheless, designing such test cases remains a challenging and resource intensive endeavor. This study extends prior work on Large Language Model (LLM) based test amplification by evaluating single agent and multi agent configurations across four additional cloud applications. The amplified test suites maintain semantic validity with minimal human intervention. The results demonstrate that agentic LLM systems can effectively generalize across heterogeneous API architectures, increasing endpoint and parameter coverage while revealing defects. Moreover, a detailed analysis of computational cost, runtime, and energy consumption highlights trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and efficiency. These findings underscore the potential of LLM driven test amplification to advance the automation and sustainability of REST API testing in complex cloud environments.

Abstract: Advances in large language models are making personalized AI agents a new research focus. While current agent systems primarily rely on personalized external memory databases to deliver customized experiences, they face challenges such as memory redundancy, memory staleness, and poor memory-context integration, largely due to the lack of effective memory updates during interaction. To tackle these issues, we propose a new memory management system designed for affective scenarios. Our approach employs a Bayesian-inspired memory update algorithm with the concept of memory entropy, enabling the agent to autonomously maintain a dynamically updated memory vector database by minimizing global entropy to provide more personalized services. To better evaluate the system's effectiveness in this context, we propose DABench, a benchmark focusing on emotional expression and emotional change toward objects. Experimental results demonstrate that, our system achieves superior performance in personalization, logical coherence, and accuracy. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the Bayesian-inspired update mechanism in alleviating memory bloat. Our work offers new insights into the design of long-term memory systems.

<title>From Pixels to Paths: A Multi-Agent Framework for Editable Scientific Illustration</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27452</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.27452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific illustrations demand both high information density and post-editability. However, current generative models have two major limitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking semantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange independent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation methods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users into the cumbersome cycle of "writing-compiling-reviewing" and lack the intuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in scientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent framework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol. VisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a Toolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector graphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be explicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and any element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the quality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with seven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density scientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception, and interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments to verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our evaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models, presenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of their respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the impacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of illustrations.

<title>Thought Branches: Interpreting LLM Reasoning Requires Resampling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27484</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.27484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling. We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First, when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause the action? In "agentic misalignment" scenarios, we resample specific sentences to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes "unfaithful", can our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.

<title>Auditing LLM Editorial Bias in News Media Exposure</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly act as gateways to web content, shaping how millions of users encounter online information. Unlike traditional search engines, whose retrieval and ranking mechanisms are well studied, the selection processes of web-connected LLMs add layers of opacity to how answers are generated. By determining which news outlets users see, these systems can influence public opinion, reinforce echo chambers, and pose risks to civic discourse and public trust.
  This work extends two decades of research in algorithmic auditing to examine how LLMs function as news engines. We present the first audit comparing three leading agents, GPT-4o-Mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Gemini-2.0-Flash, against Google News, asking: \textit{How do LLMs differ from traditional aggregators in the diversity, ideology, and reliability of the media they expose to users?}
  Across 24 global topics, we find that, compared to Google News, LLMs surface significantly fewer unique outlets and allocate attention more unevenly. In the same way, GPT-4o-Mini emphasizes more factual and right-leaning sources; Claude-3.7-Sonnet favors institutional and civil-society domains and slightly amplifies right-leaning exposure; and Gemini-2.0-Flash exhibits a modest left-leaning tilt without significant changes in factuality. These patterns remain robust under prompt variations and alternative reliability benchmarks. Together, our findings show that LLMs already enact \textit{agentic editorial policies}, curating information in ways that diverge from conventional aggregators. Understanding and governing their emerging editorial power will be critical for ensuring transparency, pluralism, and trust in digital information ecosystems.

<title>Asynchronous Risk-Aware Multi-Agent Packet Routing for Ultra-Dense LEO Satellite Networks</title>

arXiv:2510.27506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of ultra-dense LEO constellations creates a complex and asynchronous network environment, driven by their massive scale, dynamic topologies, and significant delays. This unique complexity demands an adaptive packet routing algorithm that is asynchronous, risk-aware, and capable of balancing diverse and often conflicting QoS objectives in a decentralized manner. However, existing methods fail to address this need, as they typically rely on impractical synchronous decision-making and/or risk-oblivious approaches. To tackle this gap, we introduce PRIMAL, an event-driven multi-agent routing framework designed specifically to allow each satellite to act independently on its own event-driven timeline, while managing the risk of worst-case performance degradation via a principled primal-dual approach. This is achieved by enabling agents to learn the full cost distribution of the targeted QoS objectives and constrain tail-end risks. Extensive simulations on a LEO constellation with 1584 satellites validate its superiority in effectively optimizing latency and balancing load. Compared to a recent risk-oblivious baseline, it reduces queuing delay by over 70%, and achieves a nearly 12 ms end-to-end delay reduction in loaded scenarios. This is accomplished by resolving the core conflict between naive shortest-path finding and congestion avoidance, highlighting such autonomous risk-awareness as a key to robust routing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly excelling and outpacing human performance on many tasks. However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers either rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems such as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture the decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some inadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be formally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee verifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic decision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for functions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of LLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or real-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and verifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically analyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks to break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests the ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given multi-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE) tests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill cause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score 65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art LLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity increases. Our code is available at our \href{https://github.com/nik-hz/tempobench}{GitHub repository}.

Abstract: x402 enables Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) services like application programming interfaces (APIs), data feeds, and inference providers to accept cryptocurrency payments for access. As agents increasingly consume these services, discovery becomes critical: which swap interface should an agent trust? Which data provider is the most reliable? We introduce TraceRank, a reputation-weighted ranking algorithm where payment transactions serve as endorsements. TraceRank seeds addresses with precomputed reputation metrics and propagates reputation through payment flows weighted by transaction value and temporal recency. Applied to x402's payment graph, this surfaces services preferred by high-reputation users rather than those with high transaction volume. Our system combines TraceRank with semantic search to respond to natural language queries with high quality results. We argue that reputation propagation resists Sybil attacks by making spam services with many low-reputation payers rank below legitimate services with few high-reputation payers. Ultimately, we aim to construct a search method for x402 enabled services that avoids infrastructure bias and has better performance than purely volume based or semantic methods.

<title>Interact-RAG: Reason and Interact with the Corpus, Beyond Black-Box Retrieval</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.27566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced LLMs by incorporating external information. However, prevailing agentic RAG approaches are constrained by a critical limitation: they treat the retrieval process as a black-box querying operation. This confines agents' actions to query issuing, hindering its ability to tackle complex information-seeking tasks. To address this, we introduce Interact-RAG, a new paradigm that elevates the LLM agent from a passive query issuer into an active manipulator of the retrieval process. We dismantle the black-box with a Corpus Interaction Engine, equipping the agent with a set of action primitives for fine-grained control over information retrieval. To further empower the agent on the entire RAG pipeline, we first develop a reasoning-enhanced workflow, which enables both zero-shot execution and the synthesis of interaction trajectories. We then leverage this synthetic data to train a fully autonomous end-to-end agent via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by refinement with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that Interact-RAG significantly outperforms other advanced methods, validating the efficacy of our reasoning-interaction strategy.

Abstract: Solving mathematical reasoning problems requires not only accurate access to relevant knowledge but also careful, multi-step thinking. However, current retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective, follow inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information from multiple sources. We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge Integration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that orchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and computation-efficient. When evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level science QA GPQA, SIGMA consistently outperforms both open- and closed-source systems, achieving an absolute performance improvement of 7.4%. Our results demonstrate that multi-agent, on-demand knowledge integration significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive problem-solving. We will release the code upon publication.

Abstract: AI agents could accelerate scientific discovery by automating hypothesis formation, experiment design, coding, execution, and analysis, yet existing benchmarks probe narrow skills in simplified settings. To address this gap, we introduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end assessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It comprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and uncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research environment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2. Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management, and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over 11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the next generation of code-based research benchmark.

Abstract: Automation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) design can help developers meet increasing computational demands. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, but face challenges due to limited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. While prompt engineering and fine-tuning have limitations in knowledge coverage and training costs, multi-agent architectures offer a training-free paradigm to enhance reasoning through collaborative generation. However, current multi-agent approaches suffer from two critical deficiencies: susceptibility to noise propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration. We propose VeriMoA, a training-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework with two synergistic innovations. First, a quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all intermediate HDL outputs and enables quality-based ranking and selection across the entire generation process, encouraging knowledge accumulation over layers of reasoning. Second, a multi-path generation strategy that leverages C++ and Python as intermediate representations, decomposing specification-to-HDL translation into two-stage processes that exploit LLM fluency in high-resource languages while promoting solution diversity. Comprehensive experiments on VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that VeriMoA achieves 15--30% improvements in Pass@1 across diverse LLM backbones, especially enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives without requiring costly training.

<title>Visual Backdoor Attacks on MLLM Embodied Decision Making via Contrastive Trigger Learning</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data. These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world deployment.

Abstract: While AI agents have long been discussed and studied in computer science, today's Agentic AI systems are something new. We consider other definitions of Agentic AI and propose a new realist definition. Agentic AI is a software delivery mechanism, comparable to software as a service (SaaS), which puts an application to work autonomously in a complex enterprise setting. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) as foundation models have driven excitement in Agentic AI. We note, however, that Agentic AI systems are primarily applications, not foundations, and so their success depends on validation by end users and principal stakeholders. The tools and techniques needed by the principal users to validate their applications are quite different from the tools and techniques used to evaluate foundation models. Ironically, with good validation measures in place, in many cases the foundation models can be replaced with much simpler, faster, and more interpretable models that handle core logic. When it comes to Agentic AI, validity is what you need. LLMs are one option that might achieve it.

<title>Interaction as Intelligence Part II: Asynchronous Human-Agent Rollout for Long-Horizon Task Training</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in domains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface manipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon, domain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall into two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that can take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on domain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering. Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing prior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it possible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable trajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter out sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5 model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the untrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop sampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon, domain-specialized tasks.

<title>NegoCollab: A Common Representation Negotiation Approach for Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception</title>

Abstract: Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the perception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as participating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This leads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents, consequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all agents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training cost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as the representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with significant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper alignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method based on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator during training to derive the common representation from the local representations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent domain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual transformation of features between the local representation space and the common representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To better align local representations to the common representation containing multimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic alignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the training. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully distilled into the sender.

<title>Challenges in Credit Assignment for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Open Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review, focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem (CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis, in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and significant performance degradation.

<title>When AI Trading Agents Compete: Adverse Selection of Meta-Orders by Reinforcement Learning-Based Market Making</title>

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms by which medium-frequency trading agents are adversely selected by opportunistic high-frequency traders. We use reinforcement learning (RL) within a Hawkes Limit Order Book (LOB) model in order to replicate the behaviours of high-frequency market makers. In contrast to the classical models with exogenous price impact assumptions, the Hawkes model accounts for endogenous price impact and other key properties of the market (Jain et al. 2024a). Given the real-world impracticalities of the market maker updating strategies for every event in the LOB, we formulate the high-frequency market making agent via an impulse control reinforcement learning framework (Jain et al. 2025). The RL used in the simulation utilises Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) and self-imitation learning. To replicate the adverse selection phenomenon, we test the RL agent trading against a medium frequency trader (MFT) executing a meta-order and demonstrate that, with training against the MFT meta-order execution agent, the RL market making agent learns to capitalise on the price drift induced by the meta-order. Recent empirical studies have shown that medium-frequency traders are increasingly subject to adverse selection by high-frequency trading agents. As high-frequency trading continues to proliferate across financial markets, the slippage costs incurred by medium-frequency traders are likely to increase over time. However, we do not observe that increased profits for the market making RL agent necessarily cause significantly increased slippages for the MFT agent.

<title>Social learning moderates the tradeoffs between efficiency, stability, and equity in group foraging</title>

Abstract: Social learning shapes collective search by influencing how individuals use peer information. Empirical and computational studies show that optimal information sharing that is neither too localized nor too diffuse, can enhance resource detection and coordination. Building on these insights, we develop a randomized search model that integrates social learning with area-restricted search (ARS) to investigate how communication distance affects collective foraging. The model includes three behavioral modes: exploration, exploitation, and targeted walk, which are governed by a single parameter, $\rho$, that balances exploration and exploitation at the group level. We quantify how $\rho$ influences group efficiency ($\eta$), temporal variability/burstiness ($B$), and agent variability/equity in resource distribution ($\sigma$), revealing a clear trade-off among these outcomes. When $\rho \to 0$, agents explore independently, maximizing collective exploration. As $\rho$ increases, individuals preferentially exploit patches discovered by others: $\eta$ first rises and then declines, while $B$ shows the opposite trend. Group efficiency is optimized at interior $\rho$ values that balance exploration and exploitation. At the largest $\rho$, equality among agents is highest, but efficiency declines and burstiness is maximized too. Finally, by introducing negative rewards, we examine how social learning mitigates risk.

Abstract: Distributed optimization is the standard way of speeding up machine learning training, and most of the research in the area focuses on distributed first-order, gradient-based methods. Yet, there are settings where some computationally-bounded nodes may not be able to implement first-order, gradient-based optimization, while they could still contribute to joint optimization tasks. In this paper, we initiate the study of hybrid decentralized optimization, studying settings where nodes with zeroth-order and first-order optimization capabilities co-exist in a distributed system, and attempt to jointly solve an optimization task over some data distribution. We essentially show that, under reasonable parameter settings, such a system can not only withstand noisier zeroth-order agents but can even benefit from integrating such agents into the optimization process, rather than ignoring their information. At the core of our approach is a new analysis of distributed optimization with noisy and possibly-biased gradient estimators, which may be of independent interest. Our results hold for both convex and non-convex objectives. Experimental results on standard optimization tasks confirm our analysis, showing that hybrid first-zeroth order optimization can be practical, even when training deep neural networks.

Abstract: As a unifying concept in economics, game theory, and operations research, even in the Robotics and AI field, the utility is used to evaluate the level of individual needs, preferences, and interests. Especially for decision-making and learning in multi-agent/robot systems (MAS/MRS), a suitable utility model can guide agents in choosing reasonable strategies to achieve their current needs and learning to cooperate and organize their behaviors, optimizing the system's utility, building stable and reliable relationships, and guaranteeing each group member's sustainable development, similar to the human society. Although these systems' complex, large-scale, and long-term behaviors are strongly determined by the fundamental characteristics of the underlying relationships, there has been less discussion on the theoretical aspects of mechanisms and the fields of applications in Robotics and AI. This paper introduces a utility-orient needs paradigm to describe and evaluate inter and outer relationships among agents' interactions. Then, we survey existing literature in relevant fields to support it and propose several promising research directions along with some open problems deemed necessary for further investigations.

Abstract: Developing Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents typically assumes a \textit{train-once-deploy-once} strategy, which is unrealistic as deployed agents continually encounter novel environments. To address this, we propose the Continual Vision-and-Language Navigation (CVLN) paradigm, where agents learn and adapt incrementally across multiple \textit{scene domains}. CVLN includes two setups: Initial-instruction based CVLN for instruction-following, and Dialogue-based CVLN for dialogue-guided navigation. We also introduce two simple yet effective baselines for sequential decision-making: Perplexity Replay (PerpR), which replays difficult episodes, and Episodic Self-Replay (ESR), which stores and revisits action logits during training. Experiments show that existing continual learning methods fall short for CVLN, while PerpR and ESR achieve better performance by efficiently utilizing replay memory.

Abstract: Information seeking and integration is a complex cognitive task that consumes enormous time and effort. Inspired by the remarkable progress of Large Language Models, recent works attempt to solve this task by combining LLMs and search engines. However, these methods still obtain unsatisfying performance due to three challenges: (1) complex requests often cannot be accurately and completely retrieved by the search engine once (2) corresponding information to be integrated is spread over multiple web pages along with massive noise, and (3) a large number of web pages with long contents may quickly exceed the maximum context length of LLMs. Inspired by the cognitive process when humans solve these problems, we introduce MindSearch to mimic the human minds in web information seeking and integration, which can be instantiated by a simple yet effective LLM-based multi-agent framework. The WebPlanner models the human mind of multi-step information seeking as a dynamic graph construction process: it decomposes the user query into atomic sub-questions as nodes in the graph and progressively extends the graph based on the search result from WebSearcher. Tasked with each sub-question, WebSearcher performs hierarchical information retrieval with search engines and collects valuable information for WebPlanner. The multi-agent design of MindSearch enables the whole framework to seek and integrate information parallelly from larger-scale (e.g., more than 300) web pages in 3 minutes, which is worth 3 hours of human effort. MindSearch demonstrates significant improvement in the response quality in terms of depth and breadth, on both close-set and open-set QA problems. Besides, responses from MindSearch based on InternLM2.5-7B are preferable by humans to ChatGPT-Web and Perplexity.ai applications, which implies that MindSearch can already deliver a competitive solution to the proprietary AI search engine.

Abstract: This paper addresses distributed constrained multiobjective resource allocation problems (DCMRAPs) in multi-agent networks, where agents face multiple conflicting local objectives under local and global constraints. By reformulating DCMRAPs as single-objective weighted $L_p$ problems, the proposed approach enables distributed solutions without relying on predefined weighting coefficients or centralized decision-making. Leveraging prescribed-time control and dynamic event-triggered mechanisms (ETMs), a novel distributed algorithm is proposed within a prescribed time through sampled communication. Using generalized time-based generators (TBGs), the algorithm provides more flexibility in optimizing solution accuracy and trajectory smoothness without the constraints of initial conditions. Novel dynamic ETMs, integrated with generalized TBGs, improve communication efficiency by adapting to local error metrics and network-based disagreements, while providing enhanced flexibility in balancing solution accuracy and communication frequency. The Zeno behavior is excluded. Validated by Lyapunov analysis and simulation experiments, our method demonstrates superior control performance and efficiency compared to existing methods, advancing distributed optimization across diverse applications.

Abstract: Social choice theory is the study of preference aggregation across a population, used both in mechanism design for human agents and in the democratic alignment of language models. In this study, we propose the representative social choice framework for the modeling of democratic representation in collective decisions, where the number of issues and individuals are too large for mechanisms to consider all preferences directly. These scenarios are widespread in real-world decision-making processes, such as jury trials, legislation, corporate governance, and, more recently, language model alignment. In representative social choice, the population is represented by a finite sample of individual-issue pairs based on which social choice decisions are made. We show that many of the deepest questions in representative social choice can be formulated as statistical learning problems, and prove the generalization properties of social choice mechanisms using the theory of machine learning. We further formulate axioms for representative social choice, and prove Arrow-like impossibility theorems with new combinatorial tools of analysis. Our framework introduces the representative approach to social choice, opening up research directions at the intersection of social choice, learning theory, and AI alignment.

Abstract: The Robust Regularized Markov Decision Process (RRMDP) is proposed to learn policies robust to dynamics shifts by adding regularization to the transition dynamics in the value function. Existing methods mostly use unstructured regularization, potentially leading to conservative policies under unrealistic transitions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, the $d$-rectangular linear RRMDP ($d$-RRMDP), which introduces latent structures into both transition kernels and regularization. We focus on offline reinforcement learning, where an agent learns policies from a precollected dataset in the nominal environment. We develop the Robust Regularized Pessimistic Value Iteration (R2PVI) algorithm that employs linear function approximation for robust policy learning in $d$-RRMDPs with $f$-divergence based regularization terms on transition kernels. We provide instance-dependent upper bounds on the suboptimality gap of R2PVI policies, demonstrating that these bounds are influenced by how well the dataset covers state-action spaces visited by the optimal robust policy under robustly admissible transitions. We establish information-theoretic lower bounds to verify that our algorithm is near-optimal. Finally, numerical experiments validate that R2PVI learns robust policies and exhibits superior computational efficiency compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: With the integration of large language models (LLMs), embodied agents have strong capabilities to understand and plan complicated natural language instructions. However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in the real world. Existing benchmarks predominantly overlook critical safety risks, focusing solely on planning performance, while a few evaluate LLMs' safety awareness only on non-interactive image-text data. To address this gap, we present SafeAgentBench -- the first comprehensive benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents in interactive simulation environments, covering both explicit and implicit hazards. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) an executable, diverse, and high-quality dataset of 750 tasks, rigorously curated to cover 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 9 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that, although agents based on different design frameworks exhibit substantial differences in task success rates, their overall safety awareness remains weak. The most safety-conscious baseline achieves only a 10% rejection rate for detailed hazardous tasks. Moreover, simply replacing the LLM driving the agent does not lead to notable improvements in safety awareness. Dataset and codes are available in https://github.com/shengyin1224/SafeAgentBench and https://huggingface.co/datasets/safeagentbench/SafeAgentBench.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (MRAG) systems have shown promise in enhancing the generation capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing MRAG frameworks primarily adhere to rigid, single-step retrieval strategies that fail to address real-world challenges of information acquisition and query reformulation. In this work, we introduce the task of Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Planning (MRAG Planning) that aims at effective information seeking and integration while minimizing computational overhead. Specifically, we propose CogPlanner, an agentic plug-and-play framework inspired by human cognitive processes, which iteratively determines query reformulation and retrieval strategies to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. CogPlanner supports parallel and sequential modeling paradigms. Furthermore, we introduce CogBench, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the MRAG Planning task and facilitate lightweight CogPlanner integration with resource-efficient MLLMs, such as Qwen2-VL-7B-Cog. Experimental results demonstrate that CogPlanner significantly outperforms existing MRAG baselines, offering improvements in both accuracy and efficiency with minimal additional computational costs.

Abstract: Accurate emotion recognition is pivotal for nuanced and engaging human-computer interactions, yet remains difficult to achieve, especially in dynamic, conversation-like settings. In this study, we showcase how integrating eye-tracking data, temporal dynamics, and personality traits can substantially enhance the detection of both perceived and felt emotions. Seventy-three participants viewed short, speech-containing videos from the CREMA-D dataset, while being recorded for eye-tracking signals (pupil size, fixation patterns), Big Five personality assessments, and self-reported emotional states. Our neural network models combined these diverse inputs including stimulus emotion labels for contextual cues and yielded marked performance gains compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically, perceived valence predictions reached a macro F1-score of 0.76, and models incorporating personality traits and stimulus information demonstrated significant improvements in felt emotion accuracy. These results highlight the benefit of unifying physiological, individual and contextual factors to address the subjectivity and complexity of emotional expression. Beyond validating the role of user-specific data in capturing subtle internal states, our findings inform the design of future affective computing and human-agent systems, paving the way for more adaptive and cross-individual emotional intelligence in real-world interactions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose BR-MTRL, a Byzantine-resilient multi-task representation learning framework that handles faulty or malicious agents. Our approach leverages representation learning through a shared neural network model, where all clients share fixed layers, except for a client-specific final layer. This structure captures shared features among clients while enabling individual adaptation, making it a promising approach for leveraging client data and computational power in heterogeneous federated settings to learn personalized models. To learn the model, we employ an alternating gradient descent strategy: each client optimizes its local model, updates its final layer, and sends estimates of the shared representation to a central server for aggregation. To defend against Byzantine agents, we employ two robust aggregation methods for client-server communication, Geometric Median and Krum. Our method enables personalized learning while maintaining resilience in distributed settings. We implemented the proposed algorithm in a federated testbed built using Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform and compared its performance with various benchmark algorithms and their variations. Through experiments using real-world datasets, including CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST, we demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our approach and its transferability to new unseen clients with limited data, even in the presence of Byzantine adversaries.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a paradigm of artificial intelligence where an agent uses a neural network to learn which actions to take in a given environment. DRL has recently gained traction from being able to solve complex environments like driving simulators, 3D robotic control, and multiplayer-online-battle-arena video games. Numerous implementations of the state-of-the-art algorithms responsible for training these agents, like the Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms, currently exist. However, studies make the mistake of assuming implementations of the same algorithm to be consistent and thus, interchangeable. In this paper, through a differential testing lens, we present the results of studying the extent of implementation inconsistencies, their effect on the implementations' performance, as well as their impact on the conclusions of prior studies under the assumption of interchangeable implementations. The outcomes of our differential tests showed significant discrepancies between the tested algorithm implementations, indicating that they are not interchangeable. In particular, out of the five PPO implementations tested on 56 games, three implementations achieved superhuman performance for 50% of their total trials while the other two implementations only achieved superhuman performance for less than 15% of their total trials. As part of a meticulous manual analysis of the implementations' source code, we analyzed implementation discrepancies and determined that code-level inconsistencies primarily caused these discrepancies. Lastly, we replicated a study and showed that this assumption of implementation interchangeability was sufficient to flip experiment outcomes. Therefore, this calls for a shift in how implementations are being used.

Abstract: The development of control policies for multi-robot systems traditionally follows a complex and labor-intensive process, often lacking the flexibility to adapt to dynamic tasks. This has motivated research on methods to automatically create control policies. However, these methods require iterative processes of manually crafting and refining objective functions, thereby prolonging the development cycle. This work introduces \textit{GenSwarm}, an end-to-end system that leverages large language models to automatically generate and deploy control policies for multi-robot tasks based on simple user instructions in natural language. As a multi-language-agent system, GenSwarm achieves zero-shot learning, enabling rapid adaptation to altered or unseen tasks. The white-box nature of the code policies ensures strong reproducibility and interpretability. With its scalable software and hardware architectures, GenSwarm supports efficient policy deployment on both simulated and real-world multi-robot systems, realizing an instruction-to-execution end-to-end functionality that could prove valuable for robotics specialists and non-specialists alike.The code of the proposed GenSwarm system is available online: https://github.com/WindyLab/GenSwarm.

<title>NaviAgent: Bilevel Planning on Tool Navigation Graph for Large-Scale Orchestration</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated the ability to act as function call agents by invoking external tools, enabling them to solve tasks beyond their static knowledge. However, existing agents typically call tools step by step at a time without a global view of task structure. As tools depend on each other, this leads to error accumulation and limited scalability, particularly when scaling to thousands of tools. To address these limitations, we propose NaviAgent, a novel bilevel architecture that decouples task planning from tool execution through graph-based modeling of the tool ecosystem. At the task-planning level, the LLM-based agent decides whether to respond directly, clarify user intent, invoke a toolchain, or execute tool outputs, ensuring broad coverage of interaction scenarios independent of inter-tool complexity. At the execution level, a continuously evolving Tool World Navigation Model (TWNM) encodes structural and behavioral relations among tools, guiding the agent to generate scalable and robust invocation sequences. By incorporating feedback from real tool interactions, NaviAgent supports closed-loop optimization of planning and execution, moving beyond tool calling toward adaptive navigation of large-scale tool ecosystems. Experiments show that NaviAgent achieves the best task success rates across models and tasks, and integrating TWMN further boosts performance by up to 17 points on complex tasks, underscoring its key role in toolchain orchestration.

<title>HiRA: A Hierarchical Reasoning Framework for Decoupled Planning and Execution in Deep Search</title>

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively. Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution, leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage specialized expertise for different types of information processing. Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/ignorejjj/HiRA.

<title>Emergent Cognitive Convergence via Implementation: A Structured Loop Reflecting Four Theories of Mind</title>

Abstract: We report a structural convergence among four influential theories of mind: Kahneman's dual-system theory, Friston's predictive processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind, emerging unintentionally within a practical AI architecture known as Agentic Flow. Designed to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs), Agentic Flow comprises five interlocking modules: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Memory, and Action, organized into a repeatable cognitive loop. Although originally inspired only by Minsky and Clark, subsequent analysis revealed that its structure echoes computational motifs from all four theories, suggesting that theoretical convergence can emerge naturally from implementation demands rather than deliberate synthesis. Controlled evaluations confirmed this: the structured agent achieved 95.8% task success versus 62.3% for baseline LLMs, demonstrating robust constraint adherence and reproducible reasoning. We describe this convergence under a broader descriptive meta-architecture called PEACE, highlighting recurring design patterns such as predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control. Later formalized as the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), this framework generalizes the same principles as a foundation for behavioral intelligence in LLM-based agents. Rather than claiming theoretical unification, this paper proposes that intelligent architectures may evolve toward shared structural patterns shaped by practical constraints. As a position paper, it aims to frame this convergence as an interpretive reflection rather than a finalized theory, inviting further theoretical and experimental dialogue. Agentic Flow, or equivalently the Structured Cognitive Loop, thus offers a glimpse of how a unified cognitive form can arise not from abstraction, but from the necessities of real-world reasoning.

Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation - referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML, impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables reliable implementation with web agents to date. We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) - within the same input token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations - one token order above, but within the model's context window - outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover, yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

Abstract: Proactive AR agents promise context-aware assistance, but their interactions often rely on explicit voice prompts or responses, which can be disruptive or socially awkward. We introduce Sensible Agent, a framework designed for unobtrusive interaction with these proactive agents. Sensible Agent dynamically adapts both "what" assistance to offer and, crucially, "how" to deliver it, based on real-time multimodal context sensing. Informed by an expert workshop (n=12) and a data annotation study (n=40), the framework leverages egocentric cameras, multimodal sensing, and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to infer context and suggest appropriate actions delivered via minimally intrusive interaction modes. We demonstrate our prototype on an XR headset through a user study (n=10) in both AR and VR scenarios. Results indicate that Sensible Agent significantly reduces perceived interaction effort compared to voice-prompted baseline, while maintaining high usability and achieving higher preference.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning with sparse rewards, demonstrations can accelerate learning, but determining when to imitate them remains challenging. We propose Smooth Policy Regularisation from Demonstrations (SPReD), a framework that addresses the fundamental question: when should an agent imitate a demonstration versus follow its own policy? SPReD uses ensemble methods to explicitly model Q-value distributions for both demonstration and policy actions, quantifying uncertainty for comparisons. We develop two complementary uncertainty-aware methods: a probabilistic approach estimating the likelihood of demonstration superiority, and an advantage-based approach scaling imitation by statistical significance. Unlike prevailing methods (e.g. Q-filter) that make binary imitation decisions, SPReD applies continuous, uncertainty-proportional regularisation weights, reducing gradient variance during training. Despite its computational simplicity, SPReD achieves remarkable gains in experiments across eight robotics tasks, outperforming existing approaches by up to a factor of 14 in complex tasks while maintaining robustness to demonstration quality and quantity. Our code is available at https://github.com/YujieZhu7/SPReD.

<title>PartnerMAS: An LLM Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Business Partner Selection on High-Dimensional Features</title>

Abstract: High-dimensional decision-making tasks, such as business partner selection, involve evaluating large candidate pools with heterogeneous numerical, categorical, and textual features. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong in-context reasoning capabilities, single-agent or debate-style systems often struggle with scalability and consistency in such settings. We propose PartnerMAS, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes evaluation into three layers: a Planner Agent that designs strategies, Specialized Agents that perform role-specific assessments, and a Supervisor Agent that integrates their outputs. To support systematic evaluation, we also introduce a curated benchmark dataset of venture capital co-investments, featuring diverse firm attributes and ground-truth syndicates. Across 140 cases, PartnerMAS consistently outperforms single-agent and debate-based multi-agent baselines, achieving up to 10--15\% higher match rates. Analysis of agent reasoning shows that planners are most responsive to domain-informed prompts, specialists produce complementary feature coverage, and supervisors play an important role in aggregation. Our findings demonstrate that structured collaboration among LLM agents can generate more robust outcomes than scaling individual models, highlighting PartnerMAS as a promising framework for high-dimensional decision-making in data-rich domains.

Abstract: We review the historical development and current trends of artificially intelligent agents (agentic AI) in the social and behavioral sciences: from the first programmable computers, and social simulations soon thereafter, to today's experiments with large language models. This overview emphasizes the role of AI in the scientific process and the changes brought about, both through technological advancements and the broader evolution of science from around 1950 to the present. Some of the specific points we cover include: the challenges of presenting the first social simulation studies to a world unaware of computers, the rise of social systems science, intelligent game theoretic agents, the age of big data and the epistemic upheaval in its wake, and the current enthusiasm around applications of generative AI, and many other topics. A pervasive theme is how deeply entwined we are with the technologies we use to understand ourselves.

Abstract: Algorithmic decision making is increasingly prevalent, but often vulnerable to strategic manipulation by agents seeking a favorable outcome. Prior research has shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a decision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier accuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification context, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and how principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a Stackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces its decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate their features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary classifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true features, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility (or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of strategic agents. We also show that beyond improving accuracy, abstention can also serve as a deterrent to manipulation, making it costlier for agents, especially those less qualified, to manipulate to achieve a positive outcome when manipulation costs are significant enough to affect agent behavior. These results highlight abstention as a valuable tool for reducing the negative effects of strategic behavior in algorithmic decision making systems.

Abstract: We show that, in many settings, the worst-case performance of a distributed optimization algorithm is independent of the number of agents in the system, and can thus be computed in the fundamental case with just two agents. This result relies on a novel approach that systematically exploits symmetries in worst-case performance computation, framed as Semidefinite Programming (SDP) via the Performance Estimation Problem (PEP) framework. Harnessing agent symmetries in the PEP yields compact problems whose size is independent of the number of agents in the system. When all agents are equivalent in the problem, we establish the explicit conditions under which the resulting worst-case performance is independent of the number of agents and is therefore equivalent to the basic case with two agents. Our compact PEP formulation also allows the consideration of multiple equivalence classes of agents, and its size only depends on the number of equivalence classes. This enables practical and automated performance analysis of distributed algorithms in numerous complex and realistic settings, such as the analysis of the worst agent performance. We leverage this new tool to analyze the performance of the EXTRA algorithm in advanced settings and its scalability with the number of agents, providing a tighter analysis and deeper understanding of the algorithm performance.

arXiv:2508.08325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When online sellers use AI learning algorithms to automatically compete on e-commerce platforms, there is concern that they will learn to coordinate on higher than competitive prices. However, this concern was primarily raised in single-dimension price competition. We investigate whether this prediction holds when sellers make pricing and advertising decisions together, i.e., two-dimensional decisions. We analyze competition in multi-agent reinforcement learning, and use a large-scale dataset from Amazon.com to provide empirical evidence. We show that when consumers have high search costs, learning algorithms can coordinate on prices lower than competitive prices, facilitating a win-win-win for consumers, sellers, and platforms. This occurs because algorithms learn to coordinate on lower advertising bids, which lower advertising costs, leading to lower prices and enlarging demand on the platform. We also show that our results generalize to any learning algorithm that uses exploration of price and advertising bids. Consistent with our predictions, an empirical analysis shows that price levels exhibit a negative interaction between estimated consumer search costs and algorithm usage index. We analyze the platform's strategic response and find that reserve price adjustments will not increase platform profits, but commission adjustments will, while maintaining the beneficial outcomes for both sellers and consumers.

Abstract: As LLM agents advance, they are increasingly mediating economic decisions, ranging from product discovery to transactions, on behalf of users. Such applications promise benefits but also raise many questions about agent accountability and value for users. Addressing these questions requires understanding how agents behave in realistic market conditions. However, previous research has largely evaluated agents in constrained settings, such as single-task marketplaces (e.g., negotiation) or structured two-agent interactions. Real-world markets are fundamentally different: they require agents to handle diverse economic activities and coordinate within large, dynamic ecosystems where multiple agents with opaque behaviors may engage in open-ended dialogues. To bridge this gap, we investigate two-sided agentic marketplaces where Assistant agents represent consumers and Service agents represent competing businesses. To study these interactions safely, we develop Magentic-Marketplace-- a simulated environment where Assistants and Services can operate. This environment enables us to study key market dynamics: the utility agents achieve, behavioral biases, vulnerability to manipulation, and how search mechanisms shape market outcomes. Our experiments show that frontier models can approach optimal welfare-- but only under ideal search conditions. Performance degrades sharply with scale, and all models exhibit severe first-proposal bias, creating 10-30x advantages for response speed over quality. These findings reveal how behaviors emerge across market conditions, informing the design of fair and efficient agentic marketplaces.

<title>Optimal Information Combining for Multi-Agent Systems Using Adaptive Bias Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.25793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases, leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile? We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit, validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

Abstract: Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a long-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling between body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in which large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical debate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each round, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a control agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A panel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in simulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through iterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing increasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and specialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a quadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther than the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a powerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that multi-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising new paradigm for automated robot design.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Agentic AI Governance Assurance & Trust Engine (AAGATE), a Kubernetes-native control plane designed to address the unique security and governance challenges posed by autonomous, language-model-driven agents in production. Recognizing the limitations of traditional Application Security (AppSec) tooling for improvisational, machine-speed systems, AAGATE operationalizes the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF). It integrates specialized security frameworks for each RMF function: the Agentic AI Threat Modeling MAESTRO framework for Map, a hybrid of OWASP's AIVSS and SEI's SSVC for Measure, and the Cloud Security Alliance's Agentic AI Red Teaming Guide for Manage. By incorporating a zero-trust service mesh, an explainable policy engine, behavioral analytics, and decentralized accountability hooks, AAGATE provides a continuous, verifiable governance solution for agentic AI, enabling safe, accountable, and scalable deployment. The framework is further extended with DIRF for digital identity rights, LPCI defenses for logic-layer injection, and QSAF monitors for cognitive degradation, ensuring governance spans systemic, adversarial, and ethical risks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6% to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to 85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks, demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online RL for flow-based VLAs.

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams. FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights, and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

<title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Market Making: Competition without Collusion</title>

Abstract: Algorithmic collusion has emerged as a central question in AI: Will the interaction between different AI agents deployed in markets lead to collusion? More generally, understanding how emergent behavior, be it a cartel or market dominance from more advanced bots, affects the market overall is an important research question.
  We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to study algorithmic collusion in market making. The framework includes a self-interested market maker (Agent~A), which is trained in an uncertain environment shaped by an adversary, and three bottom-layer competitors: the self-interested Agent~B1 (whose objective is to maximize its own PnL), the competitive Agent~B2 (whose objective is to minimize the PnL of its opponent), and the hybrid Agent~B$^\star$, which can modulate between the behavior of the other two. To analyze how these agents shape the behavior of each other and affect market outcomes, we propose interaction-level metrics that quantify behavioral asymmetry and system-level dynamics, while providing signals potentially indicative of emergent interaction patterns.
  Experimental results show that Agent~B2 secures dominant performance in a zero-sum setting against B1, aggressively capturing order flow while tightening average spreads, thus improving market execution efficiency. In contrast, Agent~B$^\star$ exhibits a self-interested inclination when co-existing with other profit-seeking agents, securing dominant market share through adaptive quoting, yet exerting a milder adverse impact on the rewards of Agents~A and B1 compared to B2. These findings suggest that adaptive incentive control supports more sustainable strategic co-existence in heterogeneous agent environments and offers a structured lens for evaluating behavioral design in algorithmic trading systems.

<title>RECAP: Reproducing Copyrighted Data from LLMs Training with an Agentic Pipeline</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25941</link>

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

<title>Estimating cognitive biases with attention-aware inverse planning</title>

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases, and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset, demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with attention-aware inverse planning.

<title>Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25992</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.25992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance. Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

<title>From Queries to Insights: Agentic LLM Pipelines for Spatio-Temporal Text-to-SQL</title>

arXiv:2510.25997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries, where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline (llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35 natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive geospatial assistants.

<title>Engineering Social Optimality via Utility Shaping in Non-Cooperative Games under Incomplete Information and Imperfect Monitoring</title>

arXiv:2510.26033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study decentralized decision-making where agents optimize private objectives under incomplete information and imperfect public monitoring, in a non-cooperative setting. By shaping utilities-embedding shadow prices or Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT)-aligned penalties-we make the stage game an exact-potential game whose unique equilibrium equals the (possibly constrained) social optimum. We characterize the Bayesian equilibrium as a stochastic variational inequality; strong monotonicity follows from a single-inflection compressed/stretched-exponential response combined with convex pricing. We give tracking bounds for damped-gradient and best-response-with-hysteresis updates under a noisy public index, and corresponding steady-state error. The framework accommodates discrete and continuous action sets and composes with slower discrete assignment. Deployable rules include: embed prices/penalties; publish a single public index; tune steps, damping, and dual rates for contraction. Computational experiments cover (i) a multi-tier supply chain and (ii) a non-cooperative agentic-AI compute market of bidding bots. Relative to price-only baselines, utility shaping attains near-centralized welfare, eliminates steady-state constraint/capacity violations when feasible, and accelerates convergence; with quantization, discrete equilibria track continuous ones within the mesh. The blueprint is portable to demand response, cloud/edge scheduling, and transportation pricing and biosecurity/agriculture. Overall, utility shaping plus a public index implements the constrained social optimum with stable equilibria under noise and drift-an operations-research-friendly alternative to heavy messaging or full mechanism design.

<title>SIRAJ: Diverse and Efficient Red-Teaming for LLM Agents via Distilled Structured Reasoning</title>

Abstract: The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings, our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1 model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative framework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer models.

Abstract: While autonomous racing performance in Time-Trial scenarios has seen significant progress and development, autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing and overtaking are still severely limited. These limitations are particularly apparent in real-life driving scenarios where state-of-the-art algorithms struggle to safely or reliably complete overtaking manoeuvres. This is important, as reliable navigation around other vehicles is vital for safe autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing. The F1Tenth Competition provides a useful opportunity for developing wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms on a standardised physical platform. The competition format makes it possible to evaluate overtaking and wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms against the state-of-the-art. This research presents a novel racing and overtaking agent capable of learning to reliably navigate a track and overtake opponents in both simulation and reality. The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against opponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world. The results demonstrate that the agent's training against opponents enables deliberate overtaking behaviours with an overtaking rate of 87% compared 56% for an agent trained just to race.

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers, then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

<title>Performance Analysis of Dynamic Equilibria in Joint Path Selection and Congestion Control</title>

Abstract: Path-aware networking, a cornerstone of next-generation architectures like SCION and Multipath QUIC, empowers end-hosts with fine-grained control over traffic forwarding. This capability, however, introduces a critical stability risk: uncoordinated, greedy path selection by a multitude of agents can induce persistent, high-amplitude network oscillations. While this phenomenon is well-known, its quantitative performance impact across key metrics has remained poorly understood. In this paper, we address this gap by developing the first axiomatic framework for analyzing the joint dynamics of path selection and congestion control. Our model enables the formal characterization of the system's dynamic equilibria-the stable, periodic patterns of oscillation-and provides a suite of axioms to rate their performance in terms of efficiency, loss avoidance, convergence, fairness, and responsiveness. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off in protocol design between predictable performance (efficiency, convergence) and user-centric goals (fairness, responsiveness). We prove, however, that no such trade-off exists among efficiency, convergence, and loss avoidance, which can be simultaneously optimized through careful parameter tuning. Furthermore, we find that agent migration can, counter-intuitively, enhance stability by de-synchronizing traffic, a theoretical result validated by our simulations. These findings provide a principled design map for engineering robust, high-performance protocols for the future path-aware Internet.

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation (HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections (hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

arXiv:2510.26098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface (GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address. By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding, knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux, IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However, current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks, and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for, compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models (LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS, which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection, cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g., GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation systems.

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021 driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8 surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge. Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of handling complex real-world situations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent, a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization, 3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench (+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems. Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both large-scale enterprise R\&amp;D workflows and fundamental scientific research, where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal impact.

Abstract: As emerging mobility modes continue to expand, many cities face declining bus ridership, increasing fiscal pressure to sustain underutilized routes, and growing inefficiencies in resource allocation. This study employs an agent-based modelling (ABM) approach calibrated through a large language model (LLM) using few-shot learning to examine how progressive bus route cutbacks affect passenger dissatisfaction across demographic groups and overall network resilience. Using IC-card data from Beijing's Huairou District, the LLM-calibrated ABM estimated passenger sensitivity parameters related to travel time, waiting, transfers, and crowding. Results show that the structural configuration of the bus network exerts a stronger influence on system stability than capacity or operational factors. The elimination of high-connectivity routes led to an exponential rise in total dissatisfaction, particularly among passengers with disabilities and older adults. The evolution of dissatisfaction exhibited three distinct phases - stable, transitional, and critical. Through the analysis of each stage, this study found that the continuous bus route reduction scenario exhibits three-stage thresholds. Once these thresholds are crossed, even a small reduction in routes may lead to a significant loss of passenger flow. Research highlights the nonlinear response of user sentiment to service reductions and underscore the importance of maintaining structural critical routes and providing stable services to vulnerable groups for equitable and resilient transport planning.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model checkpoints to facilitate future research.

<title>Linking Heterogeneous Data with Coordinated Agent Flows for Social Media Analysis</title>

Abstract: Social media platforms generate massive volumes of heterogeneous data, capturing user behaviors, textual content, temporal dynamics, and network structures. Analyzing such data is crucial for understanding phenomena such as opinion dynamics, community formation, and information diffusion. However, discovering insights from this complex landscape is exploratory, conceptually challenging, and requires expertise in social media mining and visualization. Existing automated approaches, though increasingly leveraging large language models (LLMs), remain largely confined to structured tabular data and cannot adequately address the heterogeneity of social media analysis. We present SIA (Social Insight Agents), an LLM agent system that links heterogeneous multi-modal data -- including raw inputs (e.g., text, network, and behavioral data), intermediate outputs, mined analytical results, and visualization artifacts -- through coordinated agent flows. Guided by a bottom-up taxonomy that connects insight types with suitable mining and visualization techniques, SIA enables agents to plan and execute coherent analysis strategies. To ensure multi-modal integration, it incorporates a data coordinator that unifies tabular, textual, and network data into a consistent flow. Its interactive interface provides a transparent workflow where users can trace, validate, and refine the agent's reasoning, supporting both adaptability and trustworthiness. Through expert-centered case studies and quantitative evaluation, we show that SIA effectively discovers diverse and meaningful insights from social media while supporting human-agent collaboration in complex analytical tasks.

Abstract: AI agents capable of GUI understanding and Model Context Protocol are increasingly deployed to automate mobile tasks. However, their reliance on over-privileged, static permissions creates a critical vulnerability: instruction injection. Malicious instructions, embedded in otherwise benign content like emails, can hijack the agent to perform unauthorized actions. We present AgentSentry, a lightweight runtime task-centric access control framework that enforces dynamic, task-scoped permissions. Instead of granting broad, persistent permissions, AgentSentry dynamically generates and enforces minimal, temporary policies aligned with the user's specific task (e.g., register for an app), revoking them upon completion. We demonstrate that AgentSentry successfully prevents an instruction injection attack, where an agent is tricked into forwarding private emails, while allowing the legitimate task to complete. Our approach highlights the urgent need for intent-aligned security models to safely govern the next generation of autonomous agents.

Abstract: Motion imitation is a promising approach for humanoid locomotion, enabling agents to acquire humanlike behaviors. Existing methods typically rely on high-quality motion capture datasets such as AMASS, but these are scarce and expensive, limiting scalability and diversity. Recent studies attempt to scale data collection by converting large-scale internet videos, exemplified by Humanoid-X. However, they often introduce physical artifacts such as floating, penetration, and foot skating, which hinder stable imitation. In response, we introduce PHUMA, a Physically-grounded HUMAnoid locomotion dataset that leverages human video at scale, while addressing physical artifacts through careful data curation and physics-constrained retargeting. PHUMA enforces joint limits, ensures ground contact, and eliminates foot skating, producing motions that are both large-scale and physically reliable. We evaluated PHUMA in two sets of conditions: (i) imitation of unseen motion from self-recorded test videos and (ii) path following with pelvis-only guidance. In both cases, PHUMA-trained policies outperform Humanoid-X and AMASS, achieving significant gains in imitating diverse motions. The code is available at https://davian-robotics.github.io/PHUMA.

<title>Retrieval Augmented Generation-Enhanced Distributed LLM Agents for Generalizable Traffic Signal Control with Emergency Vehicles</title>

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3 adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17 to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization in LLM Agent Training</title>

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient, unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust, generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

Abstract: Repository-level software engineering tasks require large language models (LLMs) to efficiently navigate and extract information from complex codebases through multi-turn tool interactions. Existing approaches face significant limitations: training-free, in-context learning methods struggle to guide agents effectively in tool utilization and decision-making based on environmental feedback, while training-based approaches typically rely on costly distillation from larger LLMs, introducing data compliance concerns in enterprise environments. To address these challenges, we introduce RepoSearch-R1, a novel agentic reinforcement learning framework driven by Monte-carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This approach allows agents to generate diverse, high-quality reasoning trajectories via self-training without requiring model distillation or external supervision. Based on RepoSearch-R1, we construct a RepoQA-Agent specifically designed for repository question-answering tasks. Comprehensive evaluation on repository question-answering tasks demonstrates that RepoSearch-R1 achieves substantial improvements of answer completeness: 16.0% enhancement over no-retrieval methods, 19.5% improvement over iterative retrieval methods, and 33% increase in training efficiency compared to general agentic reinforcement learning approaches. Our cold-start training methodology eliminates data compliance concerns while maintaining robust exploration diversity and answer completeness across repository-level reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure, since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign, task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios.

<title>The Geometry of Dialogue: Graphing Language Models to Reveal Synergistic Teams for Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>

arXiv:2510.26352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM teams.

Abstract: Forestry forwarders play a central role in mechanized timber harvesting by picking up and moving logs from the felling site to a processing area or a secondary transport vehicle. Forwarder operation is challenging and physically and mentally exhausting for the operator who must control the machine in remote areas for prolonged periods of time. Therefore, even partial automation of the process may reduce stress on the operator. This study focuses on continuing previous research efforts in application of reinforcement learning agents in automating log handling process, extending the task from grasping which was studied in previous research to full log loading operation. The resulting agent will be capable to automate a full loading procedure from locating and grappling to transporting and delivering the log to a forestry forwarder bed. To train the agent, a trailer type forestry forwarder simulation model in NVIDIA's Isaac Gym and a virtual environment for a typical log loading scenario were developed. With reinforcement learning agents and a curriculum learning approach, the trained agent may be a stepping stone towards application of reinforcement learning agents in automation of the forestry forwarder. The agent learnt grasping a log in a random position from grapple's random position and transport it to the bed with 94% success rate of the best performing agent.

<title>Adaptive Context Length Optimization with Low-Frequency Truncation for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football (GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a "Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools -- such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns" that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement. During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well. Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering, provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Abstract: Online social networks have transformed the ways in which political mobilization messages are disseminated, raising new questions about how peer influence operates at scale. Building on the landmark 61-million-person Facebook experiment \citep{bond201261}, we develop an agent-based simulation framework that integrates real U.S. Census demographic distributions, authentic Twitter network topology, and heterogeneous large language model (LLM) agents to examine the effect of mobilization messages on voter turnout. Each simulated agent is assigned demographic attributes, a personal political stance, and an LLM variant (\texttt{GPT-4.1}, \texttt{GPT-4.1-Mini}, or \texttt{GPT-4.1-Nano}) reflecting its political sophistication. Agents interact over realistic social network structures, receiving personalized feeds and dynamically updating their engagement behaviors and voting intentions. Experimental conditions replicate the informational and social mobilization treatments of the original Facebook study. Across scenarios, the simulator reproduces qualitative patterns observed in field experiments, including stronger mobilization effects under social message treatments and measurable peer spillovers. Our framework provides a controlled, reproducible environment for testing counterfactual designs and sensitivity analyses in political mobilization research, offering a bridge between high-validity field experiments and flexible computational modeling.\footnote{Code and data available at https://github.com/CausalMP/LLM-SocioPol}

arXiv:2510.26498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool. Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78). The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76). Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3 Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522 (0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

Abstract: The proliferation of collaborative robots across diverse tasks and embodiments presents a central challenge: achieving lifelong adaptability, scalable coordination, and robust scheduling in multi-agent systems. Existing approaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical frameworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent memory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long horizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting the need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we introduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable, and robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene geometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared representation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a brain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global planning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute actions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution enables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent state synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex coordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results demonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous embodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and robust multi-robot collaboration.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards, thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}: injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}: employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to advanced proprietary LLMs.

Abstract: In post-disaster scenarios, the rapid deployment of adequate communication infrastructure is essential to support disaster search, rescue, and recovery operations. To achieve this, uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) has emerged as a promising solution for emergency communication due to its low cost and deployment flexibility. However, conventional untethered UAV (U-UAV) is constrained by size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations, making it incapable of maintaining the operation of a macro base station. To address this limitation, we propose a heterogeneous UAV-based framework that integrates tethered UAV (T-UAV) and U-UAVs, where U-UAVs are utilized to enhance the throughput of cell-edge ground user equipments (G-UEs) and guarantee seamless connectivity during G-UEs' mobility to safe zones. It is noted that the integrated access and backhaul (IAB) technique is adopted to support the wireless backhaul of U-UAVs. Accordingly, we formulate a two-timescale joint user scheduling and trajectory control optimization problem, aiming to maximize the downlink throughput under asymmetric traffic demands and G-UEs' mobility. To solve the formulated problem, we proposed a two-timescale multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (TTS-MADDPG) algorithm based on the centralized training and distributed execution paradigm. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmarks, including the two-timescale multi-agent proximal policy optimization (TTS-MAPPO) algorithm and MADDPG scheduling method, with robust and higher throughput. Specifically, the proposed algorithm obtains up to 12.2\% average throughput gain compared to the MADDPG scheduling method.

Abstract: While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at complex tasks, their growing autonomy with operational complexity often leads to critical inefficiencies, such as excessive token consumption and failures arising from misinformation. Existing methods primarily focus on post-hoc failure attribution, lacking proactive, real-time interventions to enhance robustness and efficiency. To this end, we introduce SupervisorAgent, a lightweight and modular framework for runtime, adaptive supervision that operates without altering the base agent's architecture. Triggered by an LLM-free adaptive filter, SupervisorAgent intervenes at critical junctures to proactively correct errors, guide inefficient behaviors, and purify observations. On the challenging GAIA benchmark, SupervisorAgent reduces the token consumption of the Smolagent framework by an average of 29.45% without compromising its success rate. Extensive experiments across five additional benchmarks (math reasoning, code generation, and question answering) and various SoTA foundation models validate the broad applicability and robustness of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/SupervisorAgent.

<title>Agentic AI Home Energy Management System: A Large Language Model Framework for Residential Load Scheduling</title>

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic, agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension, and future research.

<title>A DRL-Empowered Multi-Level Jamming Approach for Secure Semantic Communication</title>

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) aims to transmit only task-relevant information, thereby improving communication efficiency but also exposing semantic information to potential eavesdropping. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-empowered multi-level jamming approach to enhance the security of SemCom systems over MIMO fading wiretap channels. This approach combines semantic layer jamming, achieved by encoding task-irrelevant text, and physical layer jamming, achieved by encoding random Gaussian noise. These two-level jamming signals are superposed with task-relevant semantic information to protect the transmitted semantics from eavesdropping. A deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is further introduced to dynamically design and optimize the precoding matrices for both taskrelevant semantic information and multi-level jamming signals, aiming to enhance the legitimate user's image reconstruction while degrading the eavesdropper's performance. To jointly train the SemCom model and the DDPG agent, we propose an alternating optimization strategy where the two modules are updated iteratively. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with both the encryption-based (ESCS) and encoded jammer-based (EJ) benchmarks, our method achieves comparable security while improving the legitimate user's peak signalto-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to approximately 0.6 dB.

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks. SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured, query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9 overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

<title>Heuristic Adaptation of Potentially Misspecified Domain Support for Likelihood-Free Inference in Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26656</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26656</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.26656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain distribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment conditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains constant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more descriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to suboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose three heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the posterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated into an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first expose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using stochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic support adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer length and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the resulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy learning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28% lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without additional training.

<title>Using Copilot Agent Mode to Automate Library Migration: A Quantitative Assessment</title>

Abstract: Keeping software systems up to date is essential to avoid technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and the rigidity typical of legacy systems. However, updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy, across a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the proportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study show that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages between SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to maintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate (39.75%, median).

<title>Delegated Authorization for Agents Constrained to Semantic Task-to-Scope Matching</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.26702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

<title>A General Incentives-Based Framework for Fairness in Multi-agent Resource Allocation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.26740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the General Incentives-based Framework for Fairness (GIFF), a novel approach for fair multi-agent resource allocation that infers fair decision-making from standard value functions. In resource-constrained settings, agents optimizing for efficiency often create inequitable outcomes. Our approach leverages the action-value (Q-)function to balance efficiency and fairness without requiring additional training. Specifically, our method computes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual advantage correction term to discourage over-allocation to already well-off agents. This approach is formalized within a centralized control setting, where an arbitrator uses the GIFF-modified Q-values to solve an allocation problem.
  Empirical evaluations across diverse domains, including dynamic ridesharing, homelessness prevention, and a complex job allocation task-demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover far-sighted, equitable policies. The framework's effectiveness is supported by a theoretical foundation; we prove its fairness surrogate is a principled lower bound on the true fairness improvement and that its trade-off parameter offers monotonic tuning. Our findings establish GIFF as a robust and principled framework for leveraging standard reinforcement learning components to achieve more equitable outcomes in complex multi-agent systems.

<title>The Oversight Game: Learning to Cooperatively Balance an AI Agent's Safety and Autonomy</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26752</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.26752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for making misaligned models safer after deployment.

<title>Clone Deterministic 3D Worlds with Geometrically-Regularized World Models</title>

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves. Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment. GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks, GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

Abstract: AIs have made rapid progress on research-oriented benchmarks of knowledge and reasoning, but it remains unclear how these gains translate into economic value and automation. To measure this, we introduce the Remote Labor Index (RLI), a broadly multi-sector benchmark comprising real-world, economically valuable projects designed to evaluate end-to-end agent performance in practical settings. AI agents perform near the floor on RLI, with the highest-performing agent achieving an automation rate of 2.5%. These results help ground discussions of AI automation in empirical evidence, setting a common basis for tracking AI impacts and enabling stakeholders to proactively navigate AI-driven labor automation.

arXiv:2510.26790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal, self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase. The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions traces.

Abstract: This article investigates the pedestrian group as an emergent agent. The article explores empirical data to derive emergent agency and formation state spaces and outline recurring patterns of walking behavior. In this analysis, pedestrian trajectories extracted from surveillance videos are used along with manually annotated pedestrian group memberships. We conducted manual expert evaluation of observed groups, produced new manual annotations for relevant events pertaining to group behavior and extracted metrics relevant group formation. This information along with quantitative analysis was used to model the life-cycle and formation of the group agent. Those models give structure to expectations around walking behavior of groups; from pedestrian walking independently to the emergence of a collective intention where group members tended to maintain bounded distance between each other. Disturbances to this bounded distance often happened in association with changes in either their agency or their formation states. We summarized the patterns of behavior along with the sequences of state transitions into abstract patterns, which can aid in the development of more detailed group agents in simulation and in the design of engineering systems to interact with such groups.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems are at the intersection of digital technology and engineering domains, rendering them high-value targets of sophisticated and well-funded cybersecurity threat actors. Prominent cybersecurity attacks on CPS have brought attention to the vulnerability of these systems and the inherent weaknesses of critical infrastructure reliant on them. Security modelling for CPS is an important mechanism to systematically identify and assess vulnerabilities, threats, and risks throughout system life cycles, and to ultimately ensure system resilience, safety, and reliability. This survey delves into state-of-the-art research on CPS security modelling, encompassing both threat and attack modelling. While these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, they are different concepts. This paper elaborates on the differences between threat and attack modelling, examining their implications for CPS security. We conducted a systematic search that yielded 449 papers, from which 32 were selected and categorised into three clusters: those focused on threat modelling methods, attack modelling methods, and literature reviews. Specifically, we sought to examine what security modelling methods exist today, and how they address real-world cybersecurity threats and CPS-specific attacker capabilities throughout the life cycle of CPS, which typically span longer durations compared to traditional IT systems. This paper also highlights several limitations in existing research, wherein security models adopt simplistic approaches that do not adequately consider the dynamic, multi-layer, multi-path, and multi-agent characteristics of real-world cyber-physical attacks.

Abstract: Chaos-based reinforcement learning (CBRL) is a method in which the agent's internal chaotic dynamics drives exploration. However, the learning algorithms in CBRL have not been thoroughly developed in previous studies, nor have they incorporated recent advances in reinforcement learning. This study introduced Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3), which is one of the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms that can treat deterministic and continuous action spaces, to CBRL. The validation results provide several insights. First, TD3 works as a learning algorithm for CBRL in a simple goal-reaching task. Second, CBRL agents with TD3 can autonomously suppress their exploratory behavior as learning progresses and resume exploration when the environment changes. Finally, examining the effect of the agent's chaoticity on learning shows that there exists a suitable range of chaos strength in the agent's model to flexibly switch between exploration and exploitation and adapt to environmental changes.

Abstract: AI is not only a neutral tool in team settings; it actively reshapes the social and cognitive fabric of collaboration. We advance a unified framework of alignment in distributed cognition in human-AI teams -- a process through which linguistic, cognitive, and social coordination emerge as human and AI agents co-construct a shared representational space. Across two studies, we show that exposure to AI-generated language shapes not only how people speak, but also how they think, what they attend to, and how they relate to each other. Together, these findings reveal how AI participation reorganizes the distributed cognitive architecture of teams: AI systems function as implicit social forcefields. Our findings highlight the double-edged impact of AI: the same mechanisms that enable efficient collaboration can also erode epistemic diversity and undermine natural alignment processes. We argue for rethinking AI in teams as a socially influential actor and call for new design paradigms that foreground transparency, controllability, and group-level dynamics to foster responsible, productive human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Collecting ground-truth rewards or human demonstrations for multi-step reasoning tasks is often prohibitively expensive, particularly in interactive domains such as web tasks. We introduce Self-Taught Lookahead (STL), a reward-free framework that improves language model-based value functions by reasoning explicitly about state transitions. STL can be viewed as a chain-of-thought analogue of the value iteration algorithm: instead of regressing directly on numeric values, a value LLM is trained to simulate a step of lookahead in natural language - predicting the next action, resulting state, and rationale for its value, thereby refining value estimates without any labeled data. This self-supervised procedure yields more accurate state-value predictions, which in turn enable lightweight search algorithms to expand fewer states while maintaining strong performance. Empirically, STL-trained value models built on moderately sized (8B parameter) open-weight LLMs boost web agent success rates by 39%, achieving comparable performance with proprietary models. STL also generalizes to multi-hop QA and math puzzles. We find that STL enables small open-source models to guide efficient search, reducing inference costs by integrating explicit reasoning with value learning.

Abstract: We propose V-Droid, a mobile GUI task automation agent. Unlike previous mobile agents that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as generators to directly generate actions at each step, V-Droid employs LLMs as verifiers to evaluate candidate actions before making final decisions. To realize this novel paradigm, we introduce a comprehensive framework for constructing verifier-driven mobile agents: the discretized action space construction coupled with the prefilling-only workflow to accelerate the verification process, the pair-wise progress preference training to significantly enhance the verifier's decision-making capabilities, and the scalable human-agent joint annotation scheme to efficiently collect the necessary data at scale. V-Droid obtains a substantial task success rate across several public mobile task automation benchmarks: 59.5% on AndroidWorld, 38.3% on AndroidLab, and 49% on MobileAgentBench, surpassing existing agents by 5.2%, 2.1%, and 9%, respectively. Furthermore, V-Droid achieves a remarkably low latency of 4.3s per step, which is 6.1x faster compared with existing mobile agents. The source code is available at https://github.com/V-Droid-Agent/V-Droid.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for decision-making in uncertain environments, but it often requires large amounts of data to learn an optimal policy. We address this challenge by incorporating prior model knowledge to guide exploration and accelerate the learning process. Specifically, we assume access to a model set that contains the true transition kernel and reward function. We optimize over this model set to obtain upper and lower bounds on the Q-function, which are then used to guide the exploration of the agent. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the Q-function to the optimal Q-function under the proposed class of exploring policies. Furthermore, we also introduce a data-driven regularized version of the model set optimization problem that ensures the convergence of the class of exploring policies to the optimal policy. Lastly, we show that when the model set has a specific structure, namely the bounded-parameter MDP (BMDP) framework, the regularized model set optimization problem becomes convex and simple to implement. In this setting, we also prove finite-time convergence to the optimal policy under mild assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed exploration strategy, which we call BUMEX (Bounded Uncertainty Model-based Exploration), in a simulation study. The results indicate that the proposed method can significantly accelerate learning in benchmark examples. A toolbox is available at https://github.com/JvHulst/BUMEX.

Abstract: AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly important across diverse domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Vision Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively-significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%. The source code of AVA is available at https://github.com/I-ESC/Project-Ava. The AVA-100 benchmark can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/datasets/iesc/Ava-100.

<title>AutoLibra: Agent Metric Induction from Open-Ended Human Feedback</title>

Abstract: Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics, which are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward intermediate emergent behaviors. We propose **AutoLibra**, a framework for agent evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback *e.g.* "If you find that the button is disabled, don't click it again", or "This agent has too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own" into metrics for evaluating fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as evaluators. We further propose two meta metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: "coverage" and "redundancy". Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent improvement: First, we show that AutoLibra serve human prompt engineers for diagonalize agent failures and improve prompts iterative. Moreover, we find that AutoLibra can induce metrics for automatic optimization for agents, which makes agents improve through self-regulation. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.

<title>Plasticity as the Mirror of Empowerment</title>

Abstract: Agents are minimally entities that are influenced by their past observations and act to influence future observations. This latter capacity is captured by empowerment, which has served as a vital framing concept across artificial intelligence and cognitive science. This former capacity, however, is equally foundational: In what ways, and to what extent, can an agent be influenced by what it observes? In this paper, we ground this concept in a universal agent-centric measure that we refer to as plasticity, and reveal a fundamental connection to empowerment. Following a set of desiderata on a suitable definition, we define plasticity using a new information-theoretic quantity we call the generalized directed information. We show that this new quantity strictly generalizes the directed information introduced by Massey (1990) while preserving all of its desirable properties. Under this definition, we find that plasticity is well thought of as the mirror of empowerment: The two concepts are defined using the same measure, with only the direction of influence reversed. Our main result establishes a tension between the plasticity and empowerment of an agent, suggesting that agent design needs to be mindful of both characteristics. We explore the implications of these findings, and suggest that plasticity, empowerment, and their relationship are essential to understanding agency

<title>MedAgentBoard: Benchmarking Multi-Agent Collaboration with Conventional Methods for Diverse Medical Tasks</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has stimulated interest in multi-agent collaboration for addressing complex medical tasks. However, the practical advantages of multi-agent collaboration approaches remain insufficiently understood. Existing evaluations often lack generalizability, failing to cover diverse tasks reflective of real-world clinical practice, and frequently omit rigorous comparisons against both single-LLM-based and established conventional methods. To address this critical gap, we introduce MedAgentBoard, a comprehensive benchmark for the systematic evaluation of multi-agent collaboration, single-LLM, and conventional approaches. MedAgentBoard encompasses four diverse medical task categories: (1) medical (visual) question answering, (2) lay summary generation, (3) structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) predictive modeling, and (4) clinical workflow automation, across text, medical images, and structured EHR data. Our extensive experiments reveal a nuanced landscape: while multi-agent collaboration demonstrates benefits in specific scenarios, such as enhancing task completeness in clinical workflow automation, it does not consistently outperform advanced single LLMs (e.g., in textual medical QA) or, critically, specialized conventional methods that generally maintain better performance in tasks like medical VQA and EHR-based prediction. MedAgentBoard offers a vital resource and actionable insights, emphasizing the necessity of a task-specific, evidence-based approach to selecting and developing AI solutions in medicine. It underscores that the inherent complexity and overhead of multi-agent collaboration must be carefully weighed against tangible performance gains. All code, datasets, detailed prompts, and experimental results are open-sourced at https://medagentboard.netlify.app/.

<title>Nek Minit: Harnessing Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting for Explainable Sarcasm Detection of Australian and Indian English</title>

Abstract: Sarcasm is a challenge to sentiment analysis because of the incongruity between stated and implied sentiment. The challenge is exacerbated when the implication may be relevant to a specific country or geographical region. Pragmatic metacognitive prompting (PMP) is a cognition-inspired technique that has been used for pragmatic reasoning. In this paper, we harness PMP for explainable sarcasm detection for Australian and Indian English, alongside a benchmark dataset for standard English. We manually add sarcasm explanations to an existing sarcasm-labeled dataset for Australian and Indian English called BESSTIE, and compare the performance for explainable sarcasm detection for them with FLUTE, a standard English dataset containing sarcasm explanations. Our approach utilising PMP when evaluated on two open-weight LLMs (GEMMA and LLAMA) achieves statistically significant performance improvement across all tasks and datasets when compared with four alternative prompting strategies. We also find that alternative techniques such as agentic prompting mitigate context-related failures by enabling external knowledge retrieval. The focused contribution of our work is utilising PMP in generating sarcasm explanations for varieties of English.

Abstract: Academic poster generation is a crucial yet challenging task in scientific communication, requiring the compression of long-context interleaved documents into a single, visually coherent page. To address this challenge, we introduce the first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent conference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on (i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual Coherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic and informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably (iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by VLMs answering generated quizzes. Building on this benchmark, we propose PosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser distills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns text-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and spatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by executing rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and ensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o outputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and poor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary aesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual semantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the Qwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across nearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens. It transforms a 22-page paper into a finalized yet editable .pptx poster - all for just $0.005. These findings chart clear directions for the next generation of fully automated poster-generation models. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Paper2Poster/Paper2Poster.

Abstract: A key challenge in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is achieving effective many-agent multi-step coordination in complex environments. In this work, we propose Oryx, a novel algorithm for offline cooperative MARL to directly address this challenge. Oryx adapts the recently proposed retention-based architecture Sable and combines it with a sequential form of implicit constraint Q-learning (ICQ), to develop a novel offline autoregressive policy update scheme. This allows Oryx to solve complex coordination challenges while maintaining temporal coherence over long trajectories. We evaluate Oryx across a diverse set of benchmarks from prior works -- SMAC, RWARE, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo -- covering tasks of both discrete and continuous control, varying in scale and difficulty. Oryx achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than 80% of the 65 tested datasets, outperforming prior offline MARL methods and demonstrating robust generalisation across domains with many agents and long horizons. Finally, we introduce new datasets to push the limits of many-agent coordination in offline MARL, and demonstrate Oryx's superior ability to scale effectively in such settings.

Abstract: When using a public communication channel -- whether formal or informal, such as commenting or posting on social media -- end users have no expectation of privacy: they compose a message and broadcast it for the world to see. Even if an end user takes utmost precautions to anonymize their online presence -- using an alias or pseudonym; masking their IP address; spoofing their geolocation; concealing their operating system and user agent; deploying encryption; registering with a disposable phone number or email; disabling non-essential settings; revoking permissions; and blocking cookies and fingerprinting -- one obvious element still lingers: the message itself. Assuming they avoid lapses in judgment or accidental self-exposure, there should be little evidence to validate their actual identity, right? Wrong. The content of their message -- necessarily open for public consumption -- exposes an attack vector: stylometric analysis, or author profiling. In this paper, we dissect the technique of stylometry, discuss an antithetical counter-strategy in adversarial stylometry, and devise enhancements through Unicode steganography.

<title>FSR-VLN: Fast and Slow Reasoning for Vision-Language Navigation with Hierarchical Multi-modal Scene Graph</title>

Abstract: Visual-Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental challenge in robotic systems, with broad applications for the deployment of embodied agents in real-world environments. Despite recent advances, existing approaches are limited in long-range spatial reasoning, often exhibiting low success rates and high inference latency, particularly in long-range navigation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FSR-VLN, a vision-language navigation system that combines a Hierarchical Multi-modal Scene Graph (HMSG) with Fast-to-Slow Navigation Reasoning (FSR). The HMSG provides a multi-modal map representation supporting progressive retrieval, from coarse room-level localization to fine-grained goal view and object identification. Building on HMSG, FSR first performs fast matching to efficiently select candidate rooms, views, and objects, then applies VLM-driven refinement for final goal selection. We evaluated FSR-VLN across four comprehensive indoor datasets collected by humanoid robots, utilizing 87 instructions that encompass a diverse range of object categories. FSR-VLN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all datasets, measured by the retrieval success rate (RSR), while reducing the response time by 82% compared to VLM-based methods on tour videos by activating slow reasoning only when fast intuition fails. Furthermore, we integrate FSR-VLN with speech interaction, planning, and control modules on a Unitree-G1 humanoid robot, enabling natural language interaction and real-time navigation.

<title>SignalLLM: A General-Purpose LLM Agent Framework for Automated Signal Processing</title>

Abstract: Modern signal processing (SP) pipelines, whether model-based or data-driven, often constrained by complex and fragmented workflow, rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual engineering, and struggle with adaptability and generalization under limited data. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge, in-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as powerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these potentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent framework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval, followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through prompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model invocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different signal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in communication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity recognition, and text compression. Experimental results show superior performance over traditional and existing LLM-based methods, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used in financial trading, it remains unclear whether they can reason and adapt in live markets, as most studies test models instead of agents, cover limited periods and assets, and rely on unverified data. To address these gaps, we introduce Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making, whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: As Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption accelerates in urban environments, optimizing charging infrastructure is vital for balancing user satisfaction, energy efficiency, and financial viability. This study advances beyond static models by proposing a digital twin framework that integrates agent-based decision support with embedded optimization to dynamically simulate EV charging behaviors, infrastructure layouts, and policy responses across scenarios. Applied to a localized urban site (a university campus) in Hanoi, Vietnam, the model evaluates operational policies, EV station configurations, and renewable energy sources. The interactive dashboard enables seasonal analysis, revealing a 20% drop in solar efficiency from October to March, with wind power contributing under 5% of demand, highlighting the need for adaptive energy management. Simulations show that real-time notifications of newly available charging slots improve user satisfaction, while gasoline bans and idle fees enhance slot turnover with minimal added complexity. Embedded metaheuristic optimization identifies near-optimal mixes of fast (30kW) and standard (11kW) solar-powered chargers, balancing energy performance, profitability, and demand with high computational efficiency. This digital twin provides a flexible, computation-driven platform for EV infrastructure planning, with a transferable, modular design that enables seamless scaling from localized to city-wide urban contexts.

<title>From Narrative to Action: A Hierarchical LLM-Agent Framework for Human Mobility Generation</title>

Abstract: Understanding and replicating human mobility requires not only spatial-temporal accuracy but also an awareness of the cognitive hierarchy underlying real-world travel decisions. Traditional agent-based or deep learning models can reproduce statistical patterns of movement but fail to capture the semantic coherence and causal logic of human behavior. Large language models (LLMs) show potential, but struggle to balance creative reasoning with strict structural compliance. This study proposes a Hierarchical LLM-Agent Framework, termed Narrative-to-Action, that integrates high-level narrative reasoning, mid-level reflective planning, and low-level behavioral execution within a unified cognitive hierarchy. At the macro level, one agent is employed as a "creative writer" to produce diary-style narratives rich in motivation and context, then uses another agent as a "structural parser" to convert narratives into machine-readable plans. A dynamic execution module further grounds agents in geographic environments and enables adaptive behavioral adjustments guided by a novel occupation-aware metric, Mobility Entropy by Occupation (MEO), which captures heterogeneous schedule flexibility across different occupational personalities. At the micro level, the agent executes concrete actions-selecting locations, transportation modes, and time intervals-through interaction with an environmental simulation. By embedding this multi-layer cognitive process, the framework produces not only synthetic trajectories that align closely with real-world patterns but also interpretable representations of human decision logic. This research advances synthetic mobility generation from a data-driven paradigm to a cognition-driven simulation, providing a scalable pathway for understanding, predicting, and synthesizing complex urban mobility behaviors through hierarchical LLM agents.

Abstract: Practical deployment of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) demands strong test-time performance, motivating methods that guide inference-time search and selectively spend compute to improve quality. We present the Multi-Agent System Process Reward Model (MASPRM). It assigns per-action, per-agent values to partial inter-agent transcripts and acts as an inference-time controller. MASPRM is trained from multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts without requiring step-level human annotations, by propagating returns to local targets. At inference, MASPRM guides step-level beam search and MCTS, focusing computation on promising branches and pruning early. On GSM8K and MATH, MASPRM-guided decoding with an outcome reward model (ORM) applied to the final answer, improves exact match (EM) over a single straight-through MAS pass by $+30.7$ and $+22.9$ points, respectively. A MASPRM trained on GSM8K transfers zero-shot to MATH without retraining, adding $8.4$ EM points at the same budget. MASPRM is a plug-in value model that estimates per-agent progress and complements verifier-style decoders, enabling more reliable, compute-aware multi-agent reasoning.

Abstract: Efficient mobility management and load balancing are critical to sustaining Quality of Service (QoS) in dense, highly dynamic 5G radio access networks. We present a deep reinforcement learning framework based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for autonomous, QoS-aware load balancing implemented end-to-end in a lightweight, pure-Python simulation environment. The control problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process in which the agent periodically adjusts Cell Individual Offset (CIO) values to steer user-cell associations. A multi-objective reward captures key performance indicators (aggregate throughput, latency, jitter, packet loss rate, Jain's fairness index, and handover count), so the learned policy explicitly balances efficiency and stability under user mobility and noisy observations. The PPO agent uses an actor-critic neural network trained from trajectories generated by the Python simulator with configurable mobility (e.g., Gauss-Markov) and stochastic measurement noise. Across 500+ training episodes and stress tests with increasing user density, the PPO policy consistently improves KPI trends (higher throughput and fairness, lower delay, jitter, packet loss, and handovers) and exhibits rapid, stable convergence. Comparative evaluations show that PPO outperforms rule-based ReBuHa and A3 as well as the learning-based CDQL baseline across all KPIs while maintaining smoother learning dynamics and stronger generalization as load increases. These results indicate that PPO's clipped policy updates and advantage-based training yield robust, deployable control for next-generation RAN load balancing using an entirely Python-based toolchain.

Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized Control Barrier Function (CBF) based approach for highway merging of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). In this control algorithm, each "host" vehicle negotiates with other agents in a control zone of the highway network, and enacts its own action, to perform safe and energy-efficient merge maneuvers. It uses predictor-corrector loops within the robust CBF setting for negotiation and to reconcile disagreements that may arise. There is no explicit order of vehicles and no priority. A notable feature is absence of gridlocks due to instability of the inter-agent system. Results from Monte Carlo simulations show significant improvement in the system-wide energy efficiency and traffic flow compared to a first-in-first-out approach, as well as enhanced robustness of the proposed decentralized controller compared to its centralized counterpart.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data, generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans. Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay the groundwork for future progress.

<title>Delay Tolerant Control for Autonomous Driving Using CDOB</title>

Abstract: With the rapid growth of autonomous vehicle technologies, effective path-tracking control has become a critical component in ensuring safety and efficiency in complex traffic scenarios. When a high level decision making agent generates a collision free path, a robust low level controller is required to precisely follow this trajectory. However, connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) are inherently affected by communication delays and computation delays, which significantly degrade the performance of conventional controllers such as PID or other more advanced controllers like disturbance observers (DOB). While DOB-based designs have shown effectiveness in rejecting disturbances under nominal conditions, their performance deteriorates considerably in the presence of unknown time delays. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a delay-tolerant communication disturbance observer (CDOB) framework for path-tracking control in delayed systems. The proposed CDOB compensates for the adverse effects of time delays, maintaining accurate trajectory tracking even under uncertain and varying delay conditions. It is shown through a simulation study that the proposed control architecture maintains close alignment with the reference trajectory across various scenarios, including single lane change, double-= lane change, and Elastic Band generated collision avoidance paths under various time delays. Simulation results further demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches in both tracking accuracy and delay robustness, making it well suited for autonomous driving applications.

<title>Trust Dynamics in Strategic Coopetition: Computational Foundations for Requirements Engineering in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24909</link>

Abstract: Requirements engineering increasingly occurs in multi-stakeholder environments where organizations simultaneously cooperate and compete, creating coopetitive relationships in which trust evolves dynamically based on observed behavior over repeated interactions. While conceptual modeling languages like i* represent trust relationships qualitatively, they lack computational mechanisms for analyzing how trust changes with behavioral evidence. Conversely, computational trust models from multi-agent systems provide algorithmic updating but lack grounding in requirements engineering contexts and conceptual models. This technical report bridges this gap by developing a computational trust model that extends game-theoretic foundations for strategic coopetition with dynamic trust evolution. We introduce trust as a two-layer system with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation tracking violation history. Trust evolves through asymmetric updating where cooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply, creating hysteresis effects and trust ceilings that constrain relationship recovery. We develop a structured translation framework enabling requirements engineers to instantiate computational trust models from i* dependency networks and organizational contexts. Comprehensive experimental validation across 78,125 parameter configurations establishes robust emergence of negativity bias, hysteresis effects, and cumulative damage amplification. Empirical validation using the Renault-Nissan Alliance case study (1999-2025) achieves 49 out of 60 validation points (81.7%), successfully reproducing documented trust evolution across five distinct relationship phases including crisis and recovery periods. This technical report builds upon its foundational companion work in arXiv:2510.18802.

Abstract: We introduce OrchVis, a multi-agent orchestration framework that visualizes, verifies, and coordinates goal-driven collaboration among LLM-based agents. Through hierarchical goal alignment, task assignment, and conflict resolution, OrchVis enables humans to supervise complex multi-agent workflows without micromanaging each step. The system parses user intent into structured goals, monitors execution via automated verification, and exposes inter-agent dependencies through an interactive planning panel. When conflicts arise, users can explore system-proposed alternatives and selectively replan. OrchVis advances human-centered design for multi-agent systems by combining transparent visualization with adaptive autonomy.

<title>SCOUT: A Lightweight Framework for Scenario Coverage Assessment in Autonomous Driving</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.24949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing scenario coverage is crucial for evaluating the robustness of autonomous agents, yet existing methods rely on expensive human annotations or computationally intensive Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). These approaches are impractical for large-scale deployment due to cost and efficiency constraints. To address these shortcomings, we propose SCOUT (Scenario Coverage Oversight and Understanding Tool), a lightweight surrogate model designed to predict scenario coverage labels directly from an agent's latent sensor representations. SCOUT is trained through a distillation process, learning to approximate LVLM-generated coverage labels while eliminating the need for continuous LVLM inference or human annotation. By leveraging precomputed perception features, SCOUT avoids redundant computations and enables fast, scalable scenario coverage estimation. We evaluate our method across a large dataset of real-life autonomous navigation scenarios, demonstrating that it maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost. Our results show that SCOUT provides an effective and practical alternative for large-scale coverage analysis. While its performance depends on the quality of LVLM-generated training labels, SCOUT represents a major step toward efficient scenario coverage oversight in autonomous systems.

<title>FT-ARM: Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal Language Model for Pressure Ulcer Severity Classification with Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24980</link>

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern. Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B, achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs, FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

<title>Enhancing Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning through Change Point Detection in Time Series</title>

arXiv:2510.24988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD) module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns, and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex environments.

Abstract: Generative agents are rapidly advancing in sophistication, raising urgent questions about how they might coordinate when deployed in online ecosystems. This is particularly consequential in information operations (IOs), influence campaigns that aim to manipulate public opinion on social media. While traditional IOs have been orchestrated by human operators and relied on manually crafted tactics, agentic AI promises to make campaigns more automated, adaptive, and difficult to detect. This work presents the first systematic study of emergent coordination among generative agents in simulated IO campaigns. Using generative agent-based modeling, we instantiate IO and organic agents in a simulated environment and evaluate coordination across operational regimes, from simple goal alignment to team knowledge and collective decision-making. As operational regimes become more structured, IO networks become denser and more clustered, interactions more reciprocal and positive, narratives more homogeneous, amplification more synchronized, and hashtag adoption faster and more sustained. Remarkably, simply revealing to agents which other agents share their goals can produce coordination levels nearly equivalent to those achieved through explicit deliberation and collective voting. Overall, we show that generative agents, even without human guidance, can reproduce coordination strategies characteristic of real-world IOs, underscoring the societal risks posed by increasingly automated, self-organizing IOs.

Abstract: Automatically configuring storage systems is hard: parameter spaces are large and conditions vary across workloads, deployments, and versions. Heuristic and ML tuners are often system specific, require manual glue, and degrade under changes. Recent LLM-based approaches help but usually treat tuning as a single-shot, system-specific task, which limits cross-system reuse, constrains exploration, and weakens validation. We present StorageXTuner, an LLM agent-driven auto-tuning framework for heterogeneous storage engines. StorageXTuner separates concerns across four agents - Executor (sandboxed benchmarking), Extractor (performance digest), Searcher (insight-guided configuration exploration), and Reflector (insight generation and management). The design couples an insight-driven tree search with layered memory that promotes empirically validated insights and employs lightweight checkers to guard against unsafe actions. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on RocksDB, LevelDB, CacheLib, and MySQL InnoDB with YCSB, MixGraph, and TPC-H/C. Relative to out-of-the-box settings and to ELMo-Tune, StorageXTuner reaches up to 575% and 111% higher throughput, reduces p99 latency by as much as 88% and 56%, and converges with fewer trials.

Abstract: The rapid progress and widespread deployment of LLMs and LLM-powered agents has outpaced our ability to evaluate them. Hand-crafted, static benchmarks are the primary tool for assessing model capabilities, but these quickly become saturated. In contrast, dynamic benchmarks evolve alongside the models they evaluate, but are expensive to create and continuously update. To address these challenges, we develop BeTaL (Benchmark Tuning with an LLM-in-the-loop), a framework that leverages environment design principles to automate the process of dynamic benchmark design. BeTaL works by parameterizing key design choices in base benchmark templates and uses LLMs to reason through the resulting parameter space to obtain target properties (such as difficulty and realism) in a cost-efficient manner. We validate this approach on its ability to create benchmarks with desired difficulty levels. Using BeTaL, we create two new benchmarks and extend a popular agentic benchmark $\tau$-bench. Extensive evaluation on these three tasks and multiple target difficulty levels shows that BeTaL produces benchmarks much closer to the desired difficulty, with average deviations ranging from 5.3% to 13.2% -- a 2-4x improvement over the baselines.

Abstract: Card games are widely used to study sequential decision-making under uncertainty, with real-world analogues in negotiation, finance, and cybersecurity. Typically, these games fall into three categories based on the flow of control: strictly-sequential (where players alternate single actions), deterministic-response (where some actions trigger a fixed outcome), and unbounded reciprocal-response (where alternating counterplays are permitted). A less-explored but strategically rich structure exists: the bounded one-sided response. This dynamic occurs when a player's action briefly transfers control to the opponent, who must satisfy a fixed condition through one or more sequential moves before the turn resolves. We term games featuring this mechanism Bounded One-Sided Response Games (BORGs).
  We introduce a modified version of Monopoly Deal as a benchmark environment that specifically isolates the BORG dynamic, where a Rent action forces the opponent to sequentially choose payment assets. We demonstrate that the gold-standard algorithm, Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), successfully converges on effective strategies for this domain without requiring novel algorithmic extensions. To support efficient, reproducible experimentation, we present a lightweight, full-stack research platform that unifies the environment, a parallelized CFR runtime, and a human-playable web interface, all runnable on a single workstation. This system provides a practical foundation for exploring state representation and policy learning in bounded one-sided response settings.
  The trained CFR agent and source code are available at https://monopolydeal.ai.

<title>SeeingEye: Agentic Information Flow Unlocks Multimodal Reasoning In Text-only LLMs</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in text-only large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate remarkable reasoning ability. However, these models remain fragile or entirely incapable when extended to multi-modal tasks. Existing approaches largely rely on single-form captions, which lack diversity and often fail to adapt across different types of Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. As a result, they provide no principled or efficient channel for transmitting fine-grained visual information. We introduce Seeing Eye, a modular framework that unlocks multimodal reasoning in text-only LLMs through an agent-based small VLM translator. This translator acts as a perception agent: it can invoke specialized tools (e.g., OCR and crop) and iteratively distill multimodal inputs into structured intermediate representations (SIRs) tailored to the question. These SIRs are then passed to the text-only LLM, which serves as a reasoning agent. Crucially, the translator and reasoner engage in multi-round feedback and interaction, enabling the extraction of targeted visual details and yielding more confident answers. Experiments on knowledge-intensive VQA benchmarks, including MMMU and MIA-Bench, demonstrate that Seeing Eye not only reduces inference cost but also surpasses much larger end-to-end VLMs. For example, an instantiation combining a 3B-parameter vision translator with an 8B-parameter language reasoner outperforms a monolithic 32B VLM on challenging knowledge-based questions. Our results highlight that decoupling perception from reasoning via agent information flow offers a scalable and plug-and-play pathway to multimodal reasoning, allowing strong text-only LLMs to fully leverage their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Trust-Based Optimization (TBO), a novel extension of the island model in evolutionary computation that replaces conventional periodic migrations with a flexible, agent-driven interaction mechanism based on trust or reputation. Experimental results demonstrate that TBO generally outperforms the standard island model evolutionary algorithm across various optimization problems. Nevertheless, algorithm performance varies depending on the problem type, with certain configurations being more effective for specific landscapes or dimensions. The findings suggest that trust and reputation mechanisms provide a flexible and adaptive approach to evolutionary optimization, improving solution quality in many cases.

<title>KnowCoder-A1: Incentivizing Agentic Reasoning Capability with Outcome Supervision for KBQA</title>

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs) iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries, and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision, which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling. Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1 achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107 controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics. We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics (e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically simulating human-like social dynamics.

<title>The Iceberg Index: Measuring Workforce Exposure Across the AI Economy</title>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is reshaping America's \$9.4 trillion labor market, with cascading effects that extend far beyond visible technology sectors. When AI transforms quality control tasks in automotive plants, consequences spread through logistics networks, supply chains, and local service economies. Yet traditional workforce metrics cannot capture these ripple effects: they measure employment outcomes after disruption occurs, not where AI capabilities overlap with human skills before adoption crystallizes. Project Iceberg addresses this gap using Large Population Models to simulate the human-AI labor market, representing 151 million workers as autonomous agents executing over 32,000 skills and interacting with thousands of AI tools. It introduces the Iceberg Index, a skills-centered metric that measures the wage value of skills AI systems can perform within each occupation. The Index captures technical exposure, where AI can perform occupational tasks, not displacement outcomes or adoption timelines. Analysis shows that visible AI adoption concentrated in computing and technology (2.2% of wage value, approx \$211 billion) represents only the tip of the iceberg. Technical capability extends far below the surface through cognitive automation spanning administrative, financial, and professional services (11.7%, approx \$1.2 trillion). This exposure is fivefold larger and geographically distributed across all states rather than confined to coastal hubs. Traditional indicators such as GDP, income, and unemployment explain less than 5% of this skills-based variation, underscoring why new indices are needed to capture exposure in the AI economy. By simulating how these capabilities may spread under scenarios, Iceberg enables policymakers and business leaders to identify exposure hotspots, prioritize investments, and test interventions before committing billions to implementation

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.25160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder, Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF), and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable, and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety governance.

Abstract: Designing realistic and adaptive networked threat scenarios remains a core challenge in cybersecurity research and training, still requiring substantial manual effort. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automated synthesis, unconstrained generation often yields configurations that fail validation or execution. We present AgentCyTE, a framework integrating LLM-based reasoning with deterministic, schema-constrained network emulation to generate and refine executable threat environments. Through an agentic feedback loop, AgentCyTE observes scenario outcomes, validates correctness, and iteratively enhances realism and consistency. This hybrid approach preserves LLM flexibility while enforcing structural validity, enabling scalable, data-driven experimentation and reliable scenario generation for threat modeling and adaptive cybersecurity training.

Abstract: We are given a bipartite graph $G = \left( A \cup B, E \right)$. In the one-sided model, every $a \in A$ (often called agents) ranks its neighbours $z \in N_{a}$ strictly, and no $b \in B$ has any preference order over its neighbours $y \in N_{b}$, and vertices in $B$ abstain from casting their votes to matchings. In the two-sided model with one-sided ties, every $a \in A$ ranks its neighbours $z \in N_{a}$ strictly, and every $b \in B$ puts all of its neighbours into a single large tie, i.e., $b \in B$ prefers every $y \in N_{b}$ equally. In this two-sided model with one-sided ties, when two matchings compete in a majority election, $b \in B$ abstains from casting its vote for a matching when both the matchings saturate $b$ or both leave $b$ unsaturated; else $b$ prefers the matching where it is saturated. A popular matching $M$ is \emph{robust} if it remains popular among multiple instances.
  We have analysed the cases when a robust popular matching exists in the one-sided model where only one agent alters her preference order among the instances, and we have proposed a polynomial-time algorithm to decide if there exists a robust popular matching when instances differ only with respect to the preference orders of a single agent.
  We give a simple characterisation of popular matchings in the two-sided model with one-sided ties. We show that in the two-sided model with one-sided ties, if the input instances differ only with respect to the preference orders of a single agent, there is a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether there exists a robust popular matching. We have been able to decide the stable matching problem in bipartite graphs $G = (A \cup B, E)$ where \textit{both} sides have weak preferences (ties allowed), with the restriction that every tie has length at most $k$.

Abstract: Frequent natural disasters cause significant losses to human society, and timely, efficient collection of post-disaster environmental information is the foundation for effective rescue operations. Due to the extreme complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies such as mobile crowdsensing suffer from weak environmental adaptability, insufficient professional sensing capabilities, and poor practicality of sensing solutions. Therefore, this paper explores a heterogeneous multi-agent online collaborative scheduling algorithm, HoCs-MPQ, to achieve efficient collection of post-disaster environmental information. HoCs-MPQ models collaboration and conflict relationships among multiple elements through weighted undirected graph construction, and iteratively solves the maximum weight independent set based on multi-priority queues, ultimately achieving collaborative sensing scheduling of time-dependent UA Vs, vehicles, and workers. Specifically, (1) HoCs-MPQ constructs weighted undirected graph nodes based on collaborative relationships among multiple elements and quantifies their weights, then models the weighted undirected graph based on conflict relationships between nodes; (2) HoCs-MPQ solves the maximum weight independent set based on iterated local search, and accelerates the solution process using multi-priority queues. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive real-world and simulated data. The experiments show that, compared to baseline methods (e.g., HoCs-GREEDY, HoCs-K-WTA, HoCs-MADL, and HoCs-MARL), HoCs-MPQ improves task completion rates by an average of 54.13%, 23.82%, 14.12%, and 12.89% respectively, with computation time for single online autonomous scheduling decisions not exceeding 3 seconds.

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events, represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods, often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA (Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate, and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated, interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together. Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster, better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response (15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous, theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially intelligent agents.

<title>From Medical Records to Diagnostic Dialogues: A Clinical-Grounded Approach and Dataset for Psychiatric Comorbidity</title>

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR) construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502 synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree, supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards. Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length, token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

<title>The influence of the random numbers quality on the results in stochastic simulations and machine learning</title>

Abstract: Pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) are ubiquitous in stochastic simulations and machine learning (ML), where they drive sampling, parameter initialization, regularization, and data shuffling. While widely used, the potential impact of PRNG statistical quality on computational results remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate whether differences in PRNG quality, as measured by standard statistical test suites, can influence outcomes in representative stochastic applications. Seven PRNGs were evaluated, ranging from low-quality linear congruential generators (LCGs) with known statistical deficiencies to high-quality generators such as Mersenne Twister, PCG, and Philox. We applied these PRNGs to four distinct tasks: an epidemiological agent-based model (ABM), two independent from-scratch MNIST classification implementations (Python/NumPy and C++), and a reinforcement learning (RL) CartPole environment. Each experiment was repeated 30 times per generator using fixed seeds to ensure reproducibility, and outputs were compared using appropriate statistical analyses. Results show that very poor statistical quality, as in the ''bad'' LCG failing 125 TestU01 Crush tests, produces significant deviations in ABM epidemic dynamics, reduces MNIST classification accuracy, and severely degrades RL performance. In contrast, mid-and good-quality LCGs-despite failing a limited number of Crush or BigCrush tests-performed comparably to top-tier PRNGs in most tasks, with the RL experiment being the primary exception where performance scaled with statistical quality. Our findings indicate that, once a generator meets a sufficient statistical robustness threshold, its family or design has negligible impact on outcomes for most workloads, allowing selection to be guided by performance and implementation considerations. However, the use of low-quality PRNGs in sensitive stochastic computations can introduce substantial and systematic errors.

<title>Adaptive Design of mmWave Initial Access Codebooks using Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Initial access (IA) is the process by which user equipment (UE) establishes its first connection with a base station. In 5G systems, particularly at millimeter-wave frequencies, IA integrates beam management to support highly directional transmissions. The base station employs a codebook of beams for the transmission of Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs), which are periodically swept to detect and connect users. The design of this SSB codebook is critical for ensuring reliable, wide-area coverage. In current networks, SSB codebooks are meticulously engineered by domain experts. While these expert-defined codebooks provide a robust baseline, they lack flexibility in dynamic or heterogeneous environments where user distributions vary, limiting their overall effectiveness. This paper proposes a hybrid Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for adaptive SSB codebook design. Building on top of expert knowledge, the RL agent leverages a pool of expert-designed SSB beams and learns to adaptively select or combine them based on real-time feedback. This enables the agent to dynamically tailor codebooks to the actual environment, without requiring explicit user location information, while always respecting practical beam constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that, on average, the proposed approach improves user connectivity by 10.8$\%$ compared to static expert configurations. These findings highlight the potential of combining expert knowledge with data-driven optimization to achieve more intelligent, flexible, and resilient beam management in next-generation wireless networks.

<title>A Privacy-Preserving Ecosystem for Developing Machine Learning Algorithms Using Patient Data: Insights from the TUM.ai Makeathon</title>

Abstract: The integration of clinical data offers significant potential for the development of personalized medicine. However, its use is severely restricted by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), especially for small cohorts with rare diseases. High-quality, structured data is essential for the development of predictive medical AI. In this case study, we propose a novel, multi-stage approach to secure AI training: (1) The model is designed on a simulated clinical knowledge graph (cKG). This graph is used exclusively to represent the structural characteristics of the real cKG without revealing any sensitive content. (2) The model is then integrated into the FeatureCloud (FC) federated learning framework, where it is prepared in a single-client configuration within a protected execution environment. (3) Training then takes place within the hospital environment on the real cKG, either under the direct supervision of hospital staff or via a fully automated pipeline controlled by the hospital. (4) Finally, verified evaluation scripts are executed, which only return aggregated performance metrics. This enables immediate performance feedback without sensitive patient data or individual predictions, leaving the clinic. A fundamental element of this approach involves the incorporation of a cKG, which serves to organize multi-omics and patient data within the context of real-world hospital environments. This approach was successfully validated during the TUM.ai Makeathon 2024 (TUMaiM24) challenge set by the Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital (HCH-LMU): 50 students developed models for patient classification and diagnosis without access to real data. Deploying secure algorithms via federated frameworks, such as the FC framework, could be a practical way of achieving privacy-preserving AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However, existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution, failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization, especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for real-world applications.

<title>Tackling the Algorithmic Control Crisis -- the Technical, Legal, and Ethical Challenges of Research into Algorithmic Agents</title>

Abstract: Algorithmic agents permeate every instant of our online existence. Based on our digital profiles built from the massive surveillance of our digital existence, algorithmic agents rank search results, filter our emails, hide and show news items on social networks feeds, try to guess what products we might buy next for ourselves and for others, what movies we want to watch, and when we might be pregnant. Algorithmic agents select, filter, and recommend products, information, and people. Increasingly, algorithmic agents don't just select from the range of human created alternatives, but also they create. Burgeoning algorithmic agents are capable of providing us with content made just for us, and engage with us through one-of-a-kind, personalized interactions. Studying these algorithmic agents presents a host of methodological, ethical, and logistical challenges. The objectives of our paper are two-fold. The first aim is to describe one possible approach to researching the individual and societal effects of algorithmic recommenders, and to share our experiences with the academic community. The second is to contribute to a more fundamental discussion about the ethical and legal issues of "tracking the trackers", as well as the costs and trade-offs involved. Our paper will contribute to the discussion on the relative merits, costs and benefits of different approaches to ethically and legally sound research on algorithmic governance. We will argue that besides shedding light on how users interact with algorithmic agents, we also need to be able to understand how different methods of monitoring our algorithmically controlled digital environments compare to each other in terms of costs and benefits. We conclude our article with a number of concrete suggestions for how to address the practical, ethical and legal challenges of researching algorithms and their effects on users and society.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARl) has achieved strong results in cooperative tasks but typically assumes fixed, fully controlled teams. Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) relaxes this by allowing collaboration with unknown partners, yet existing variants still presume shared conventions. We introduce Multil-party Ad Hoc Teamwork (MAHT), where controlled agents must coordinate with multiple mutually unfamiliar groups of uncontrolled teammates. To address this, we propose MARs, which builds a sparse skeleton graph and applies relational modeling to capture cross-group dvnamics. Experiments on MPE and starCralt ll show that MARs outperforms MARL and AHT baselines while converging faster.

Abstract: Metabolic disorders present a pressing global health challenge, with China carrying the world's largest burden. While continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has transformed diabetes care, its potential for supporting sub-health populations -- such as individuals who are overweight, prediabetic, or anxious -- remains underexplored. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in health coaching, yet CGM is rarely incorporated as a first-class signal. To address this gap, we conducted a six-week autoethnography, combining CGM with multimodal indicators captured via common digital devices and a chatbot that offered personalized reflections and explanations of glucose fluctuations. Our findings show how CGM-led, data-first multimodal tracking, coupled with conversational support, shaped everyday practices of diet, activity, stress, and wellbeing. This work contributes to HCI by extending CGM research beyond clinical diabetes and demonstrating how LLM-driven agents can support preventive health and reflection in at-risk populations.

<title>A proof-theoretic approach to uniform interpolation property of multi-agent modal logic</title>

Abstract: Uniform interpolation property (UIP) is a strengthening of Craig interpolation property. It was first established by Pitts(1992) based on a pure proof-theoretic method. UIP in multi-modal $\mathbf{K_n}$, $\mathbf{KD_n}$ and $\mathbf{KT_n}$ logic have been established by semantic approaches, however, a proof-theoretic approach is still lacking. B\'ilkov\'a (2007) develops the method in Pitts (1992) to show UIP in classical modal logic $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{KT}$. This paper further extends B\'ilkov\'a (2007)'s systems to establish the UIP in multi-agent modal logic $\mathbf{K_n}$, $\mathbf{KD_n}$ and $\mathbf{KT_n}$. A purely syntactic algorithm is presented to determine a uniform interpolant formula. It is also shown that quantification over propositional variables can be modeled by UIP in these systems. Furthermore, a direct argument to establish UIP without using second-order quantifiers is also presented.

Abstract: Passive fatigue during conditional automated driving can compromise driver readiness and safety. This paper presents findings from a test-track study with 40 participants in a real-world rural automated driving scenario. In this scenario, a Large Language Model (LLM) based conversational agent (CA) was designed to check in with drivers and re-engage them with their surroundings. Drawing on in-car video recordings, sleepiness ratings and interviews, we analysed how drivers interacted with the agent and how these interactions shaped alertness. Users found the CA helpful for supporting vigilance during passive fatigue. Thematic analysis of acceptability further revealed three user preference profiles that implicate future intention to use CAs. Positioning empirically observed profiles within existing CA archetype frameworks highlights the need for adaptive design sensitive to diverse user groups. This work underscores the potential of CAs as proactive Human-Machine Interface (HMI) interventions, demonstrating how natural language can support context-aware interaction during automated driving.

Abstract: AI agents have rapidly gained popularity across research and industry as systems that extend large language models with additional capabilities to plan, use tools, remember, and act toward specific goals. Yet despite their promise, developers face persistent and often underexplored challenges when building, deploying, and maintaining these emerging systems. To identify these challenges, we study developer discussions on Stack Overflow, the world's largest developer-focused Q and A platform with about 60 million questions and answers and 30 million users. We construct a taxonomy of developer challenges through tag expansion and filtering, apply LDA-MALLET for topic modeling, and manually validate and label the resulting themes. Our analysis reveals seven major areas of recurring issues encompassing 77 distinct technical challenges related to runtime integration, dependency management, orchestration complexity, and evaluation reliability. We further quantify topic popularity and difficulty to identify which issues are most common and hardest to resolve, map the tools and programming languages used in agent development, and track their evolution from 2021 to 2025 in relation to major AI model and framework releases. Finally, we present the implications of our results, offering concrete guidance for practitioners, researchers, and educators on agent reliability and developer support.

<title>Grounded in Reality: Learning and Deploying Proactive LLM from Offline Logs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25441</link>

arXiv:2510.25441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators, creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce \texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data}, bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense, turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy, decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action, state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially, \textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations, our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts, proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible, real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented LLM applications.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of 90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic: symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance). Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy hybrid intelligent systems.

Abstract: A team of mobile agents, starting from distinct nodes of a network, have to meet at the same node and declare that they all met. Agents execute the same algorithm, which they start when activated by an adversary or by an agent entering their initial node. When activated, agents traverse edges of the network in synchronous rounds. Their perception and communication are strictly local. This task, known as gathering, is a central problem in distributed mobile systems. Most prior work focuses on minimizing its time complexity, i.e., the worst-case number of rounds between the start of the earliest agent and the task completion. To break possible symmetries, deterministic solutions typically assume that agents have pairwise distinct IDs, called labels, known only to themselves. But must all labels be pairwise distinct to guarantee deterministic gathering?
  We address this question by considering agents that may share the same label. A team L is said to be gatherable if, for every initial setting of L, there is an algorithm that solves gathering. Our contribution is threefold. (1) We give a full characterization of the gatherable teams. (2) We design an algorithm that gathers all of them in poly$(n,\log\lambda)$ time, where $n$ (resp. $\lambda$) is the graph order (resp. the smallest label in L). This algorithm requires the agents to initially share only $O(\log \log \log \mu)$ bits of common knowledge, where $\mu$ is the largest label multiplicity in L. (3) We show this dependency is almost optimal to get a poly$(n,\log\lambda)$-time complexity.
  As a by-product, we get the first deterministic poly$(n,\log\lambda)$-time algorithm requiring no common knowledge to gather any team when all labels are distinct. Known to be achievable for two-agent teams, extending this to any team size faced a major challenge: termination detection. Our techniques to address it may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense terminology, and acronyms complicate effective retrieval and synthesis. This paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed system supports intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution, and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking. We evaluate our approach against a standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest that structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

<title>Off-policy Reinforcement Learning with Model-based Exploration Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration. The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning, leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across complex control tasks.

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations, primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia, USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities. Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

<title>Incorporating Social Awareness into Control of Unknown Multi-Agent Systems: A Real-Time Spatiotemporal Tubes Approach</title>

arXiv:2510.25597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized control framework that incorporates social awareness into multi-agent systems with unknown dynamics to achieve prescribed-time reach-avoid-stay tasks in dynamic environments. Each agent is assigned a social awareness index that quantifies its level of cooperation or self-interest, allowing heterogeneous social behaviors within the system. Building on the spatiotemporal tube (STT) framework, we propose a real-time STT framework that synthesizes tubes online for each agent while capturing its social interactions with others. A closed-form, approximation-free control law is derived to ensure that each agent remains within its evolving STT, thereby avoiding dynamic obstacles while also preventing inter-agent collisions in a socially aware manner, and reaching the target within a prescribed time. The proposed approach provides formal guarantees on safety and timing, and is computationally lightweight, model-free, and robust to unknown disturbances. The effectiveness and scalability of the framework are validated through simulation and hardware experiments on a 2D omnidirectional

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system, is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption, and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

<title>Don't Blind Your VLA: Aligning Visual Representations for OOD Generalization</title>

Abstract: The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning, showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together, our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to recover inherited VL capabilities.

<title>ALDEN: Reinforcement Learning for Active Navigation and Evidence Gathering in Long Documents</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and efficient long-document understanding.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow, characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate (SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents show promise for software engineering, but environment configuration remains a bottleneck due to heavy manual effort and scarce large-scale, high-quality datasets. Existing benchmarks assess only end-to-end build/test success, obscuring where and why agents succeed or fail. We introduce the Environment Configuration Diagnosis Benchmark, Enconda-bench, which provides process-level trajectory assessment of fine-grained agent capabilities during environment setup-planning, perception-driven error diagnosis, feedback-driven repair, and action to execute final environment configuration. Our task instances are automatically constructed by injecting realistic README errors and are validated in Docker for scalable, high-quality evaluation. Enconda-bench combines process-level analysis with end-to-end executability to enable capability assessments beyond aggregate success rates. Evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs and agent frameworks show that while agents can localize errors, they struggle to translate feedback into effective corrections, limiting end-to-end performance. To our knowledge, Enconda-bench is the first framework to provide process-level internal capability assessment for environment configuration, offering actionable insights for improving software engineering agents.

<title>The Tool Decathlon: Benchmarking Language Agents for Diverse, Realistic, and Long-Horizon Task Execution</title>

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604 tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

arXiv:2510.25744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding. Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and guiding development toward more effective interactions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity. Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods, especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.

Abstract: A problem of achieving minimum time consensus for a set of $N$ second-order LTI system agents with bounded inputs and fuel constraints is considered. Unlike our other works, here the damping effect in agent dynamics is included. First, the attainable set for each agent with fuel budget constraints is characterized, and its boundary equations are derived. Then, using the convexity property, the minimum time at which attainable sets of all agents have a non-empty intersection is computed. By applying Helly's theorem, the computation reduces to finding the minimum time to consensus and the corresponding consensus point for each of the triplets separately.

Abstract: We study provable multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) in the general framework of partially observable stochastic games (POSGs). To circumvent the known hardness results and the use of computationally intractable oracles, we advocate leveraging the potential \emph{information-sharing} among agents, a common practice in empirical multi-agent RL, and a standard model for multi-agent control systems with communication. We first establish several computational complexity results to justify the necessity of information-sharing, as well as the observability assumption that has enabled quasi-polynomial time and sample single-agent RL with partial observations, for tractably solving POSGs. Inspired by the inefficiency of planning in the ground-truth model, we then propose to further \emph{approximate} the shared common information to construct an approximate model of the POSG, in which an approximate \emph{equilibrium} (of the original POSG) can be found in quasi-polynomial-time, under the aforementioned assumptions. Furthermore, we develop a partially observable multi-agent RL algorithm whose time and sample complexities are \emph{both} quasi-polynomial. Finally, beyond equilibrium learning, we extend our algorithmic framework to finding the \emph{team-optimal solution} in cooperative POSGs, i.e., decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes, a more challenging goal. We establish concrete computational and sample complexities under several structural assumptions of the model. We hope our study could open up the possibilities of leveraging and even designing different \emph{information structures}, a well-studied notion in control theory, for developing both sample- and computation-efficient partially observable multi-agent RL.

Abstract: We present the architecture of a fully autonomous, bio-inspired cognitive agent built around a spiking neural network (SNN) implementing the agent's semantic memory. This agent explores its universe and learns concepts of objects/situations and of its own actions in a one-shot manner. While object/situation concepts are unary, action concepts are triples made up of an initial situation, a motor activity, and an outcome. They embody the agent's knowledge of its universe's action laws. Both kinds of concepts have different degrees of generality. To make decisions the agent queries its semantic memory for the expected outcomes of envisaged actions and chooses the action to take on the basis of these predictions. Our experiments show that the agent handles new situations by appealing to previously learned general concepts and rapidly modifies its concepts to adapt to environment changes.

Abstract: Adaptive cooperation in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires policies to express homogeneous, specialised, or mixed behaviours, yet achieving this adaptivity remains a critical challenge. While parameter sharing (PS) is standard for efficient learning, it notoriously suppresses the behavioural diversity required for specialisation. This failure is largely due to cross-agent gradient interference, a problem we find is surprisingly exacerbated by the common practice of coupling agent IDs with observations. Existing remedies typically add complexity through altered objectives, manual preset diversity levels, or sequential updates -- raising a fundamental question: can shared policies adapt without these intricacies? We propose a solution built on a key insight: an agent-conditioned hypernetwork can generate agent-specific parameters and decouple observation- and agent-conditioned gradients, directly countering the interference from coupling agent IDs with observations. Our resulting method, HyperMARL, avoids the complexities of prior work and empirically reduces policy gradient variance. Across diverse MARL benchmarks (22 scenarios, up to 30 agents), HyperMARL achieves performance competitive with six key baselines while preserving behavioural diversity comparable to non-parameter sharing methods, establishing it as a versatile and principled approach for adaptive MARL. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/KaleabTessera/HyperMARL.

Abstract: Credit assignmen, disentangling each agent's contribution to a shared reward, is a critical challenge in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). To be effective, credit assignment methods must preserve the environment's optimal policy. Some recent approaches attempt this by enforcing return equivalence, where the sum of distributed rewards must equal the team reward. However, their guarantees are conditional on a learned model's regression accuracy, making them unreliable in practice. We introduce Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution (TAR$^2$), an approach that decouples credit modeling from this constraint. A neural network learns unnormalized contribution scores, while a separate, deterministic normalization step enforces return equivalence by construction. We demonstrate that this method is equivalent to a valid Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS), which guarantees the optimal policy is preserved regardless of model accuracy. Empirically, on challenging SMACLite and Google Research Football (GRF) benchmarks, TAR$^2$ accelerates learning and achieves higher final performance than strong baselines. These results establish our method as an effective solution for the agent-temporal credit assignment problem.

Abstract: Broadcast is a central problem in distributed computing. Recently, Hussak and Trehan [PODC'19/DC'23] proposed a stateless broadcasting protocol (Amnesiac Flooding), which was surprisingly proven to terminate in asymptotically optimal time (linear in the diameter of the network). However, it remains unclear: (i) Are there other stateless terminating broadcast algorithms with the desirable properties of Amnesiac Flooding, (ii) How robust is Amnesiac Flooding with respect to \emph{faults}?
  In this paper we make progress on both of these fronts. Under a reasonable restriction (obliviousness to message content) additional to the fault-free synchronous model, we prove that Amnesiac Flooding is the \emph{only} strictly stateless deterministic protocol that can achieve terminating broadcast. We achieve this by identifying four natural properties of a terminating broadcast protocol that Amnesiac Flooding uniquely satisfies. In contrast, we prove that even minor relaxations of \textit{any} of these four criteria allow the construction of other terminating broadcast protocols.
  On the other hand, we prove that Amnesiac Flooding can become non-terminating or non-broadcasting, even if we allow just one node to drop a single message on a single edge in a single round. As a tool for proving this, we focus on the set of all \textit{configurations} of transmissions between nodes in the network, and obtain a \textit{dichotomy} characterizing the configurations, starting from which, Amnesiac Flooding terminates.
  Additionally, we characterise the structure of sets of Byzantine agents capable of forcing non-termination or non-broadcast of the protocol on arbitrary networks.

Abstract: A long-standing goal in AI is to develop agents capable of solving diverse tasks across a range of environments, including those never seen during training. Two dominant paradigms address this challenge: (i) reinforcement learning (RL), which learns policies via trial and error, and (ii) optimal control, which plans actions using a known or learned dynamics model. However, their comparative strengths in the offline setting - where agents must learn from reward-free trajectories - remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically evaluate RL and control-based methods on a suite of navigation tasks, using offline datasets of varying quality. On the RL side, we consider goal-conditioned and zero-shot methods. On the control side, we train a latent dynamics model using the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) and employ it for planning. We investigate how factors such as data diversity, trajectory quality, and environment variability influence the performance of these approaches. Our results show that model-free RL benefits most from large amounts of high-quality data, whereas model-based planning generalizes better to unseen layouts and is more data-efficient, while achieving trajectory stitching performance comparable to leading model-free methods. Notably, planning with a latent dynamics model proves to be a strong approach for handling suboptimal offline data and adapting to diverse environments.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate strong problem-solving abilities through reasoning techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting and reflection. However, it remains unclear whether these reasoning capabilities extend to a form of social intelligence: making effective decisions in cooperative contexts. We examine this question using economic games that simulate social dilemmas. First, we apply chain-of-thought and reflection prompting to GPT-4o in a Public Goods Game. We then evaluate multiple off-the-shelf models across six cooperation and punishment games, comparing those with and without explicit reasoning mechanisms. We find that reasoning models consistently reduce cooperation and norm enforcement, favoring individual rationality. In repeated interactions, groups with more reasoning agents exhibit lower collective gains. These behaviors mirror human patterns of "spontaneous giving and calculated greed." Our findings underscore the need for LLM architectures that incorporate social intelligence alongside reasoning, to help address--rather than reinforce--the challenges of collective action.

<title>MDPs with a State Sensing Cost</title>

Abstract: In many practical sequential decision-making problems, tracking the state of the environment incurs a sensing/communication/computation cost. In these settings, the agent's interaction with its environment includes the additional component of deciding when to sense the state, in a manner that balances the value associated with optimal (state-specific) actions and the cost of sensing. We formulate this as an expected discounted cost Markov Decision Process (MDP), wherein the agent incurs an additional cost for sensing its next state, but has the option to take actions while remaining `blind' to the system state. We pose this problem as a classical discounted cost MDP with an expanded (countably infinite) state space. While computing the optimal policy for this MDP is intractable in general, we derive lower bounds on the optimal value function, which allow us to bound the suboptimality gap of any policy. We also propose a computationally efficient algorithm SPI, based on policy improvement, which in practice performs close to the optimal policy. Finally, we benchmark against the state-of-the-art via a numerical case study.

Abstract: Autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) are useful for automating complex tasks but raise trust concerns due to risks such as miscoordination or goal misalignment. Explainability is vital for users' trust calibration, but explainable MAS face challenges due to complex environments, the human factor, and non-standardised evaluation. Leveraging the counterfactual effect size model and LLMs, we propose Agentic eXplanations via Interrogative Simulation (AXIS). AXIS generates human-centred action explanations for multi-agent policies by having an LLM interrogate an environment simulator using prompts like 'whatif' and 'remove' to observe and synthesise counterfactual information over multiple rounds. We evaluate AXIS on autonomous driving across ten scenarios for five LLMs with a comprehensive methodology combining robustness, subjective preference, correctness, and goal/action prediction with an external LLM as evaluator. Compared to baselines, AXIS improves perceived explanation correctness by at least 7.7% across all models and goal prediction accuracy by 23% for four models, with comparable action prediction accuracy, achieving the highest scores overall. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/gyevnarb/axis.

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly becoming better autonomous programmers, raising the prospect that they could also automate dangerous offensive cyber-operations. Current frontier model audits probe the cybersecurity risks of such agents, but most fail to account for the degrees of freedom available to adversaries in the real world. In particular, with strong verifiers and financial incentives, agents for offensive cybersecurity are amenable to iterative improvement by would-be adversaries. We argue that assessments should take into account an expanded threat model in the context of cybersecurity, emphasizing the varying degrees of freedom that an adversary may possess in stateful and non-stateful environments within a fixed compute budget. We show that even with a relatively small compute budget (8 H100 GPU Hours in our study), adversaries can improve an agent's cybersecurity capability on InterCode CTF by more than 40\% relative to the baseline -- without any external assistance. These results highlight the need to evaluate agents' cybersecurity risk in a dynamic manner, painting a more representative picture of risk.

<title>Efficient Path Planning and Task Allocation Algorithm for Boolean Specifications</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel path-planning and task assignment algorithm for multi-robot systems that should fulfill a global Boolean specification. The proposed method is based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations, which are combined with structural insights from Petri nets to improve scalability and computational efficiency. By proving that the \emph{constraint matrix} is totally unimodular (TU) for certain classes of problems, the ILP formulation can be relaxed into a Linear Programming (LP) problem without losing the integrality of the solution. This relaxation eliminates complex combinatorial techniques, significantly reducing computational overhead and thus ensuring scalability for large-scale systems. Using the approach proposed in this paper, we can solve path-planning problems for teams made up to 500 robots. The method guarantees computational tractability, handles collision avoidance and reduces computational demands through iterative LP optimization techniques. Case studies demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm in generating scalable, collision-free paths for large robot teams navigating in complex environments. While the conservative nature of collision avoidance introduces additional constraints, and thus, computational requirements, the solution remains practical and impactful for diverse applications. The algorithm is particularly applicable to real-world scenarios, including warehouse logistics where autonomous robots must efficiently coordinate tasks or search-and-rescue operations in various environments. This work contributes both theoretically and practically to scalable multi-robot path planning and task allocation, offering an efficient framework for coordinating autonomous agents in shared environments.

Abstract: The assurance of mobile app GUIs has become increasingly important, as the GUI serves as the primary medium of interaction between users and apps. Although numerous automated GUI testing approaches have been developed with diverse strategies, a substantial gap remains between these approaches and the underlying app business logic. Most existing approaches focus on general exploration rather than the completion of specific testing scenarios, often missing critical functionalities. Inspired by manual testing, which treats business logic-driven scenarios as the fundamental unit of testing, this paper introduces an approach that leverages large language models to comprehend GUI semantics and contextual relevance to given scenarios. Building on this capability, we propose ScenGen, an LLM-guided scenario-based GUI testing framework employing multi-agent collaboration to simulate and automate manual testing phases.
  Specifically, ScenGen integrates five agents: the Observer, Decider, Executor, Supervisor, and Recorder. The Observer perceives the app GUI state by extracting and structuring GUI widgets and layouts, interpreting semantic information. This is passed to the Decider, which makes scenario-driven decisions with LLM guidance to identify target widgets and determine actions toward fulfilling specific goals. The Executor performs these operations, while the Supervisor verifies alignment with intended scenario completion, ensuring traceability and consistency. Finally, the Recorder logs GUI operations into context memory as a knowledge base for subsequent decision-making and monitors runtime bugs. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ScenGen effectively generates scenario-based GUI tests guided by LLM collaboration, achieving higher relevance to business logic and improving the completeness of automated GUI testing.

Abstract: Research and practice in Intelligent Design (ID) have significantly enhanced engineering innovation, efficiency, quality, and productivity over recent decades, fundamentally reshaping how engineering designers think, behave, and interact with design processes. The recent emergence of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has demonstrated general knowledge-based reasoning capabilities, and open new avenues for further transformation in engineering design. In this context, this paper introduces Intelligent Design 4.0 (ID 4.0) as an emerging paradigm empowered by foundation model-based agentic AI systems. We review the historical evolution of ID across four distinct stages: rule-based expert systems, task-specific machine learning models, large-scale foundation AI models, and the recent emerging paradigm of foundation model-based multi-agent collaboration. We propose an ontological framework for ID 4.0 and discuss its potential to support end-to-end automation of engineering design processes through coordinated, autonomous multi-agent-based systems. Furthermore, we discuss challenges and opportunities of ID 4.0, including perspectives on data foundations, agent collaboration mechanisms, and the formulation of design problems and objectives. In sum, these insights provide a foundation for advancing Intelligent Design toward greater adaptivity, autonomy, and effectiveness in addressing the growing complexity of engineering design.

Abstract: Computer use agents are LLM-based agents that can directly interact with a graphical user interface, by processing screenshots or accessibility trees. While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap, we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150 tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser, etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and 0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions. The OS-Harm benchmark is available at https://github.com/tml-epfl/os-harm.

Abstract: Moral judgment is integral to large language models' (LLMs) social reasoning. As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to understand how LLMs function when collaborating compared to operating as individual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a Utilitarian Boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that inflict harm but maximize benefits for the greatest number of people. We study whether a similar dynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We test six models on well-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where models reason independently, and (2) Group, where they engage in multi-turn discussions in pairs or triads. In personal dilemmas, where agents decide whether to directly harm an individual for the benefit of others, all models rated moral violations as more acceptable when part of a group, demonstrating a Utilitarian Boost similar to that observed in humans. However, the mechanism for the Boost in LLMs differed: While humans in groups become more utilitarian due to heightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups showed either reduced sensitivity to norms or enhanced impartiality. We report model differences in when and how strongly the Boost manifests. We also discuss prompt and agent compositions that enhance or mitigate the effect. We end with a discussion of the implications for AI alignment, multi-agent design, and artificial moral reasoning. Code available at: https://github.com/baltaci-r/MoralAgents

Abstract: Creating an immersive and interactive theatrical experience is a long-term goal in the field of interactive narrative. The emergence of large language model (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing LLM-based drama generation methods often result in agents that lack initiative and cannot interact with the physical scene. Furthermore, these methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These limitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time performance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent framework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple topic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent improvisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given an autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based on their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to conversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of scene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon. The change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know and care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the quality of drama performance generated by HAMLET, we designed an evaluation method to assess three primary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and interaction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can create expressive and coherent theatrical experiences.

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous, decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL. Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose AI agents.

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available.

Abstract: Search agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training these agents to perform complex, multi-step reasoning. However, prior RL-based methods often rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead agents to commit to suboptimal or erroneous reasoning paths without the ability to recover. To address these limitations, we propose ReSeek, a novel self-correcting framework for training search agents. Our framework introduces a self-correction mechanism that empowers the agent to dynamically identify and recover from erroneous search paths during an episode. By invoking a special JUDGE action, the agent can judge the information and re-plan its search strategy. To guide this process, we design a dense, instructive process reward function, which decomposes into a correctness reward for retrieving factual information and a utility reward for finding information genuinely useful for the query. Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of data contamination in existing datasets, we introduce FictionalHot, a new and challenging benchmark with recently curated questions requiring complex reasoning. Being intuitively reasonable and practically simple, extensive experiments show that agents trained with ReSeek significantly outperform SOTA baselines in task success rate and path faithfulness.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness, resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS deployments.

Abstract: Innate resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy remains a major clinical challenge in metastatic melanoma, with the underlying molecular networks being poorly understood. To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2 protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis showed that this ''hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel, time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious intervention protocols in complex biological systems.

Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required for safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarms. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, simulation is used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines the classic opinion dynamics (the French-DeGroot model) with binary phase transition to describe how group pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are quantitatively meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuee agents in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to the Vicsek flocking model, and it is meaningful to explore complex social behavior during phase transition of a non-equilibrium process.

<title>Logic-based Task Representation and Reward Shaping in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: This paper presents an approach for accelerated learning of optimal plans for a given task represented using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) in multi-agent systems. Given a set of options (temporally abstract actions) available to each agent, we convert the task specification into the corresponding Buchi Automaton and proceed with a model-free approach which collects transition samples and constructs a product Semi Markov Decision Process (SMDP) on-the-fly. Value-based Reinforcement Learning algorithms can then be used to synthesize a correct-by-design controller without learning the underlying transition model of the multi-agent system. The exponential sample complexity due to multiple agents is dealt with using a novel reward shaping approach. We test the proposed algorithm in a deterministic gridworld simulation for different tasks and find that the reward shaping results in significant reduction in convergence times. We also infer that using options becomes increasing more relevant as the state and action space increases in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict events directly from numerical dynamics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled coding agents capable of generating, executing, and revising visualization code. However, existing models often fail in practical workflows due to limited language coverage, unreliable execution, and lack of iterative correction mechanisms. Progress has been constrained by narrow datasets and benchmarks that emphasize single-round generation and single-language tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce three complementary resources for advancing visualization coding agents. VisCode-Multi-679K is a large-scale, supervised dataset containing 679K validated and executable visualization samples with multi-turn correction dialogues across 12 programming languages. VisPlotBench is a benchmark for systematic evaluation, featuring executable tasks, rendered outputs, and protocols for both initial generation and multi-round self-debug. Finally, we present VisCoder2, a family of multi-language visualization models trained on VisCode-Multi-679K. Experiments show that VisCoder2 significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4.1, with further gains from iterative self-debug, reaching 82.4% overall execution pass rate at the 32B scale, particularly in symbolic or compiler-dependent languages.

<title>Agentsway -- Software Development Methodology for AI Agents-based Teams</title>

Abstract: The emergence of Agentic AI is fundamentally transforming how software is designed, developed, and maintained. Traditional software development methodologies such as Agile, Kanban, ShapeUp, etc, were originally designed for human-centric teams and are increasingly inadequate in environments where autonomous AI agents contribute to planning, coding, testing, and continuous learning. To address this methodological gap, we present "Agentsway" a novel software development framework designed for ecosystems where AI agents operate as first-class collaborators. Agentsway introduces a structured lifecycle centered on human orchestration, and privacy-preserving collaboration among specialized AI agents. The framework defines distinct roles for planning, prompting, coding, testing, and fine-tuning agents, each contributing to iterative improvement and adaptive learning throughout the development process. By integrating fine-tuned LLMs that leverage outputs and feedback from different agents throughout the development cycle as part of a retrospective learning process, Agentsway enhances domain-specific reasoning, and explainable decision-making across the entire software development lifecycle. Responsible AI principles are further embedded across the agents through the coordinated use of multiple fine-tuned LLMs and advanced reasoning models, ensuring balanced, transparent, and accountable decision-making. This work advances software engineering by formalizing agent-centric collaboration, integrating privacy-by-design principles, and defining measurable metrics for productivity and trust. Agentsway represents a foundational step toward the next generation of AI-native, self-improving software development methodologies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research effort to introduce a dedicated methodology explicitly designed for AI agent-based software engineering teams.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standardized interface enabling seamless integration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external data sources and tools. While MCP significantly reduces development complexity and enhances agent capabilities, its openness and extensibility introduce critical security vulnerabilities that threaten system trustworthiness and user data protection. This paper systematically analyzes the security landscape of MCP-based systems, identifying three principal threat categories: (1) agent hijacking attacks stemming from protocol design deficiencies; (2) traditional web vulnerabilities in MCP servers; and (3) supply chain security. To address these challenges, we comprehensively survey existing defense strategies, examining both proactive server-side scanning approaches, ranging from layered detection pipelines and agentic auditing frameworks to zero-trust registry systems, and runtime interaction monitoring solutions that provide continuous oversight and policy enforcement. Our analysis reveals that MCP security fundamentally represents a paradigm shift where the attack surface extends from traditional code execution to semantic interpretation of natural language metadata, necessitating novel defense mechanisms tailored to this unique threat model.

Abstract: Modern coding agents integrated into IDEs combine powerful tools and system-level actions, exposing a high-stakes attack surface. Existing Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) studies focus mainly on query-specific behaviors, leading to unstable attacks with lower success rates. We identify a more severe, query-agnostic threat that remains effective across diverse user inputs. This challenge can be overcome by exploiting a common vulnerability: leakage of the agent's internal prompt, which turns the attack into a constrained white-box optimization problem. We present QueryIPI, the first query-agnostic IPI method for coding agents. QueryIPI refines malicious tool descriptions through an iterative, prompt-based process informed by the leaked internal prompt. Experiments on five simulated agents show that QueryIPI achieves up to 87 percent success, outperforming baselines, and the generated malicious descriptions also transfer to real-world systems, highlighting a practical security risk to modern LLM-based coding agents.

Abstract: Large language models show promise as autonomous decision-making agents, yet their deployment in high-stakes domains remains fraught with risk. Without architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness: identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures (LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics, and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and +10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+ formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios. These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. We provide open-source implementations and interactive demonstrations for reproducibility.

<title>Game-TARS: Pretrained Foundation Models for Scalable Generalist Multimodal Game Agents</title>

arXiv:2510.23691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified, scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboard-mouse inputs. Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.

Abstract: In order for large language models to achieve true conversational continuity and benefit from experiential learning, they need memory. While research has focused on the development of complex memory systems, it remains unclear which types of memory are most effective for long-context conversational tasks. We present a systematic evaluation of memory-augmented methods using LoCoMo, a benchmark of synthetic long-context dialogues annotated for question-answering tasks that require diverse reasoning strategies. We analyse full-context prompting, semantic memory through retrieval-augmented generation and agentic memory, episodic memory through in-context learning, and procedural memory through prompt optimization. Our findings show that memory-augmented approaches reduce token usage by over 90% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Memory architecture complexity should scale with model capability, with small foundation models benefitting most from RAG, and strong instruction-tuned reasoning model gaining from episodic learning through reflections and more complex agentic semantic memory. In particular, episodic memory can help LLMs recognise the limits of their own knowledge.

<title>TDFlow: Agentic Workflows for Test Driven Software Engineering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23761</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce TDFlow, a novel test-driven agentic workflow that frames repository-scale software engineering as a test-resolution task, specifically designed to solve human-written tests. Given a set of tests, TDFlow repeatedly proposes, revises, and debugs repository-scale patches using precisely engineered sub-agents and tightly constrained tools. The workflow decomposes software engineering program repair into four components governed by respective sub-agents. This simple, forced decoupling of patch proposing, debugging, patch revision, and optional test generation (1) reduces long-context burden on any individual sub-agent, (2) focuses each sub-agent on specific, pre-defined sub-tasks, and (3) allows for specialized performance improvement on specific sub-tasks. When provided human-written tests, TDFlow attains 88.8% pass rate on SWE-Bench Lite (an absolute improvement of 27.8% over the next best system) and 94.3% on SWE-Bench Verified. Manual inspection of the 800 TDFlow runs within SWE-Bench Lite and Verified uncover only 7 instances of test hacking, which were subsequently counted as failures. Furthermore, we show that the primary obstacle to human-level software engineering performance lies within writing successful reproduction tests. We envision a human-LLM interactive system powered by TDFlow where human developers write tests solved by LLM systems. Together, these results indicate that modern LLMs, when embedded in a narrowly engineered, test-driven workflow, already achieve human-level test resolution -- with the final frontier for fully autonomous repository repair being the accurate generation of valid reproduction tests.

<title>Decentralized Multi-Agent Goal Assignment for Path Planning using Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under decentralized conditions is a long-standing challenge in robotics and artificial intelligence. This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the environment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this reasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent index ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We systematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our results show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and consistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such systems.

<title>Temporal Blindness in Multi-Turn LLM Agents: Misaligned Tool Use vs. Human Time Perception</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23853</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23853</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model agents are increasingly used in multi-turn conversational settings to interact with and execute tasks in dynamic environments. However, a key limitation is their temporal blindness: they, by default, operate with a stationary context, failing to account for the real-world time elapsed between messages. This becomes a critical liability when an agent must decide whether to invoke a tool based on how much time has passed since the last observation. Without temporal awareness, agents often either over-rely on previous context (skipping necessary tool calls), or under-rely on it (unnecessarily repeating tool calls). To study this challenge, we introduce TicToc-v1, a test set of multi-turn user-agent trajectories across 34 scenarios with varying time sensitivity. Each trajectory ends with a user question, where the need for a tool call depends on the amount of time elapsed since the last message. To give LLMs temporal context, we augment dialogue messages with explicit timestamps, bridging the gap between static dialogue and evolving environments. We then collected human preferences for these samples, creating two subsets: one where humans preferred relying on the previous observation (prefer-noTool), and another where they preferred a new tool call (prefer-Tool). We evaluated how well LLM tool-calling decisions align with human preferences under varying time intervals on TicToc-v1. Our analysis show that without time information, most models perform only slightly better than random, with the top alignment rate being just over 60%. While adding timestamps leads to a slight improvement, particularly for larger models, the improvement is modest, peaking at around 65%. We also show that naive, prompt-based alignment have limited effectiveness. Our findings highlight the need for specific post-training alignment to align multi-turn LLM tool use with human temporal perception.

<title>Can LLMs Narrate Tabular Data? An Evaluation Framework for Natural Language Representations of Text-to-SQL System Outputs</title>

arXiv:2510.23854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern industry systems like multi-turn chat agents, Text-to-SQL technology bridges natural language (NL) questions and database (DB) querying. The conversion of tabular DB results into NL representations (NLRs) enables the chat-based interaction. Currently, NLR generation is typically handled by large language models (LLMs), but information loss or errors in presenting tabular results in NL remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel evaluation method - Combo-Eval - for judgment of LLM-generated NLRs that combines the benefits of multiple existing methods, optimizing evaluation fidelity and achieving a significant reduction in LLM calls by 25-61%. Accompanying our method is NLR-BIRD, the first dedicated dataset for NLR benchmarking. Through human evaluations, we demonstrate the superior alignment of Combo-Eval with human judgments, applicable across scenarios with and without ground truth references.

<title>From Benchmarks to Business Impact: Deploying IBM Generalist Agent in Enterprise Production</title>

Abstract: Agents are rapidly advancing in automating digital work, but enterprises face a harder challenge: moving beyond prototypes to deployed systems that deliver measurable business value. This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks, slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices. Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations, achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability, auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.

Abstract: We present OraPlan-SQL, our system for the Archer NL2SQL Evaluation Challenge 2025, a bilingual benchmark requiring complex reasoning such as arithmetic, commonsense, and hypothetical inference. OraPlan-SQL ranked first, exceeding the second-best system by more than 6% in execution accuracy (EX), with 55.0% in English and 56.7% in Chinese, while maintaining over 99% SQL validity (VA). Our system follows an agentic framework with two components: Planner agent that generates stepwise natural language plans, and SQL agent that converts these plans into executable SQL. Since SQL agent reliably adheres to the plan, our refinements focus on the planner. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple sub-agents for planning and suffer from orchestration overhead, we introduce a feedback-guided meta-prompting strategy to refine a single planner. Failure cases from a held-out set are clustered with human input, and an LLM distills them into corrective guidelines that are integrated into the planner's system prompt, improving generalization without added complexity. For the multilingual scenario, to address transliteration and entity mismatch issues, we incorporate entity-linking guidelines that generate alternative surface forms for entities and explicitly include them in the plan. Finally, we enhance reliability through plan diversification: multiple candidate plans are generated for each query, with the SQL agent producing a query for each plan, and final output selected via majority voting over their executions.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents can be used to create highly engaging interactive applications through prompting personality traits and contextual data, effectively assessing their personalities has proven challenging. This novel interdisciplinary approach addresses this gap by combining agent development and linguistic analysis to assess the prompted personality of LLM-based agents in a poetry explanation task. We developed a novel, flexible question bank, informed by linguistic assessment criteria and human cognitive learning levels, offering a more comprehensive evaluation than current methods. By evaluating agent responses with natural language processing models, other LLMs, and human experts, our findings illustrate the limitations of purely deep learning solutions and emphasize the critical role of interdisciplinary design in agent development.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems powered by large language models (LLMs) and endowed with planning, tool use, memory, and autonomy, are emerging as powerful, flexible platforms for automation. Their ability to autonomously execute tasks across web, software, and physical environments creates new and amplified security risks, distinct from both traditional AI safety and conventional software security. This survey outlines a taxonomy of threats specific to agentic AI, reviews recent benchmarks and evaluation methodologies, and discusses defense strategies from both technical and governance perspectives. We synthesize current research and highlight open challenges, aiming to support the development of secure-by-design agent systems.

<title>Coordinated Autonomous Drones for Human-Centered Fire Evacuation in Partially Observable Urban Environments</title>

Abstract: Autonomous drone technology holds significant promise for enhancing search and rescue operations during evacuations by guiding humans toward safety and supporting broader emergency response efforts. However, their application in dynamic, real-time evacuation support remains limited. Existing models often overlook the psychological and emotional complexity of human behavior under extreme stress. In real-world fire scenarios, evacuees frequently deviate from designated safe routes due to panic and uncertainty. To address these challenges, this paper presents a multi-agent coordination framework in which autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) assist human evacuees in real-time by locating, intercepting, and guiding them to safety under uncertain conditions. We model the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where two heterogeneous UAV agents, a high-level rescuer (HLR) and a low-level rescuer (LLR), coordinate through shared observations and complementary capabilities. Human behavior is captured using an agent-based model grounded in empirical psychology, where panic dynamically affects decision-making and movement in response to environmental stimuli. The environment features stochastic fire spread, unknown evacuee locations, and limited visibility, requiring UAVs to plan over long horizons to search for humans and adapt in real-time. Our framework employs the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with recurrent policies to enable robust decision-making in partially observable settings. Simulation results demonstrate that the UAV team can rapidly locate and intercept evacuees, significantly reducing the time required for them to reach safety compared to scenarios without UAV assistance.

Abstract: Most AI systems today are designed to manage tasks and execute predefined steps. This makes them effective for process coordination but limited in their ability to engage in joint problem-solving with humans or contribute new ideas. We introduce MultiColleagues, a multi-agent conversational system that shows how AI agents can act as colleagues by conversing with each other, sharing new ideas, and actively involving users in collaborative ideation. In a within-subjects study with 20 participants, we compared MultiColleagues to a single-agent baseline. Results show that MultiColleagues fostered stronger perceptions of social presence, produced ideas rated significantly higher in quality and novelty, and encouraged deeper elaboration. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI agents to move beyond process partners toward colleagues that share intent, strengthen group dynamics, and collaborate with humans to advance ideas.

Abstract: We present a novel agent-based approach for the automated claim matching task with instruction-following LLMs. We propose a two-step pipeline that first generates prompts with LLMs, to then perform claim matching as a binary classification task with LLMs. We demonstrate that LLM-generated prompts can outperform SOTA with human-generated prompts, and that smaller LLMs can do as well as larger ones in the generation process, allowing to save computational resources. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using different LLMs for each step of the pipeline, i.e. using an LLM for prompt generation, and another for claim matching. Our investigation into the prompt generation process in turn reveals insights into the LLMs' understanding of claim matching.

Abstract: This survey comprehensively reviews the evolving field of multi-robot collaborative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). As an explicit scene representation, 3DGS has enabled unprecedented real-time, high-fidelity rendering, ideal for robotics. However, its use in multi-robot systems introduces significant challenges in maintaining global consistency, managing communication, and fusing data from heterogeneous sources. We systematically categorize approaches by their architecture -- centralized, distributed -- and analyze core components like multi-agent consistency and alignment, communication-efficient, Gaussian representation, semantic distillation, fusion and pose optimization, and real-time scalability. In addition, a summary of critical datasets and evaluation metrics is provided to contextualize performance. Finally, we identify key open challenges and chart future research directions, including lifelong mapping, semantic association and mapping, multi-model for robustness, and bridging the Sim2Real gap.

Abstract: The task of information extraction (IE) is to extract structured knowledge from text. However, it is often not straightforward to utilize IE output due to the mismatch between the IE ontology and the downstream application needs. We propose a new formulation of IE TEXT2DB that emphasizes the integration of IE output and the target database (or knowledge base). Given a user instruction, a document set, and a database, our task requires the model to update the database with values from the document set to satisfy the user instruction. This task requires understanding user instructions for what to extract and adapting to the given DB/KB schema for how to extract on the fly. To evaluate this new task, we introduce a new benchmark featuring common demands such as data infilling, row population, and column addition. In addition, we propose an LLM agent framework OPAL (Observe-PlanAnalyze LLM) which includes an Observer component that interacts with the database, the Planner component that generates a code-based plan with calls to IE models, and the Analyzer component that provides feedback regarding code quality before execution. Experiments show that OPAL can successfully adapt to diverse database schemas by generating different code plans and calling the required IE models. We also highlight difficult cases such as dealing with large databases with complex dependencies and extraction hallucination, which we believe deserve further investigation.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large foundation models and multi-agent systems offer unprecedented capabilities, yet current Human-in-the-Loop (HiTL) paradigms inadequately integrate human expertise, often leading to cognitive overload and decision-making bottlenecks in complex, high-stakes environments. We propose the "Human-Machine Social Hybrid Intelligence" (HMS-HI) framework, a novel architecture designed for deep, collaborative decision-making between groups of human experts and LLM-powered AI agents. HMS-HI is built upon three core pillars: (1) a \textbf{Shared Cognitive Space (SCS)} for unified, multi-modal situational awareness and structured world modeling; (2) a \textbf{Dynamic Role and Task Allocation (DRTA)} module that adaptively assigns tasks to the most suitable agent (human or AI) based on capabilities and workload; and (3) a \textbf{Cross-Species Trust Calibration (CSTC)} protocol that fosters transparency, accountability, and mutual adaptation through explainable declarations and structured feedback. Validated in a high-fidelity urban emergency response simulation, HMS-HI significantly reduced civilian casualties by 72\% and cognitive load by 70\% compared to traditional HiTL approaches, demonstrating superior decision quality, efficiency, and human-AI trust. An ablation study confirms the critical contribution of each module, highlighting that engineered trust and shared context are foundational for scalable, synergistic human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Emerging large language model (LLM) applications involve diverse reasoning strategies and agentic workflows, straining the capabilities of existing serving systems built on a monolithic token generation loop. This paper introduces Pie, a programmable LLM serving system designed for flexibility and efficiency. Pie decomposes the traditional generation loop into fine-grained service handlers exposed via an API and delegates control of the generation process to user-provided programs, called inferlets. This enables applications to implement new KV cache strategies, bespoke generation logic, and seamlessly integrate computation and I/O-entirely within the application, without requiring modifications to the serving system. Pie executes inferlets using WebAssembly, benefiting from its lightweight sandboxing. Our evaluation shows Pie matches state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks (3-12% latency overhead) while significantly improving latency and throughput (1.3x-3.4x higher) on agentic workflows by enabling application-specific optimizations.

<title>SynAD: Enhancing Real-World End-to-End Autonomous Driving Models through Synthetic Data Integration</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning and the availability of high-quality real-world driving datasets have propelled end-to-end autonomous driving. Despite this progress, relying solely on real-world data limits the variety of driving scenarios for training. Synthetic scenario generation has emerged as a promising solution to enrich the diversity of training data; however, its application within E2E AD models remains largely unexplored. This is primarily due to the absence of a designated ego vehicle and the associated sensor inputs, such as camera or LiDAR, typically provided in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce SynAD, the first framework designed to enhance real-world E2E AD models using synthetic data. Our method designates the agent with the most comprehensive driving information as the ego vehicle in a multi-agent synthetic scenario. We further project path-level scenarios onto maps and employ a newly developed Map-to-BEV Network to derive bird's-eye-view features without relying on sensor inputs. Finally, we devise a training strategy that effectively integrates these map-based synthetic data with real driving data. Experimental results demonstrate that SynAD effectively integrates all components and notably enhances safety performance. By bridging synthetic scenario generation and E2E AD, SynAD paves the way for more comprehensive and robust autonomous driving models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a significant breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence (AI), ushering in a new era of Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). HAI aims to better serve human welfare and needs, thereby placing higher demands on the intelligence level of robots, particularly in aspects such as natural language interaction, complex task planning, and execution. Intelligent agents powered by LLMs have opened up new pathways for realizing HAI. However, existing LLM-based embodied agents often lack the ability to plan and execute complex natural language control tasks online. This paper explores the implementation of intelligent robotic manipulating agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the physical world. We propose a novel embodied agent framework for robots, which comprises a human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent module and an action execution module. The vision-language agent itself includes a vision-based task planner, a natural language instruction converter, and a task performance feedback evaluator. Experimental results demonstrate that our agent achieves a 28\% higher average task success rate in both simulated and real environments compared to approaches relying solely on LLM+CLIP, significantly improving the execution success rate of high-level natural language instruction tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage multiple turns and tools to solve complex tasks, with prompt-based approaches achieving strong performance. This work demonstrates that Reinforcement Learning (RL) can push capabilities significantly further by learning from experience. Through experiments on a legal document search benchmark, we show that our RL-trained 14 Billion parameter model outperforms frontier class models (85% vs 78% accuracy). In addition, we explore turn-restricted regimes, during training and at test-time, that show these agents achieve better results if allowed to operate over longer multi-turn horizons.

<title>From Observability Data to Diagnosis: An Evolving Multi-agent System for Incident Management in Cloud Systems</title>

Abstract: Incident management (IM) is central to the reliability of large-scale cloud systems. Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper, we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop. Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.

<title>BMGQ: A Bottom-up Method for Generating Complex Multi-hop Reasoning Questions from Semi-structured Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24151</link>

Abstract: Building training-ready multi-hop question answering (QA) datasets that truly stress a model's retrieval and reasoning abilities remains highly challenging recently. While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture the characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring the integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them unsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL). Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require multi-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs prohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck for training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.
  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured knowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence clusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and diversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their combination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality with a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching. The result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption detection tasks. We propose a systematic framework built on four core components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing, Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature, top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on safety-critical autonomous driving tasks.

<title>BLM$_1$: A Boundless Large Model for Cross-Space, Cross-Task, and Cross-Embodiment Learning</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However, significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \textbf{Boundless Large Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key capabilities -- \textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving $\sim\!\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\sim\!\textbf{3%}$ in physical tasks.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) has enabled agentic systems capable of perceiving and acting across diverse environments. A challenging yet impactful frontier is the development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where "decision-first, observation-later" mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications (Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The code is publicly available at: {https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MGA-3571}.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in simulating human-like social behaviors. Social graphs provide high-quality supervision signals that encode both local interactions and global network structure, yet they remain underutilized for LLM training. To address this gap, we propose Graphia, the first general LLM-based social graph simulation framework that leverages graph data as supervision for LLM post-training via reinforcement learning. With GNN-based structural rewards, Graphia trains specialized agents to predict whom to interact with (destination selection) and how to interact (edge generation), followed by designed graph generation pipelines. We evaluate Graphia under two settings: Transductive Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG), a micro-level task with our proposed node-wise interaction alignment metrics; and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG), a macro-level task with our proposed metrics for aligning emergent network properties. On three real-world networks, Graphia improves micro-level alignment by 6.1% in the composite destination selection score, 12% in edge classification accuracy, and 27.9% in edge content BERTScore over the strongest baseline. For macro-level alignment, it achieves 41.11% higher structural similarity and 32.98% better replication of social phenomena such as power laws and echo chambers. Graphia also supports counterfactual simulation, generating plausible behavioral shifts under platform incentives. Our results show that social graphs can serve as high-quality supervision signals for LLM post-training, closing the gap between agent behaviors and network dynamics for LLM-based simulation. Code is available at https://github.com/Ji-Cather/Graphia.git.

arXiv:2510.24257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing robots and autonomous systems that can interact with human in a more natural and intuitive way. One of the key challenges in achieving this goal is to enable these systems to manipulate objects and tools in a manner that is similar to that of humans. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning human-style manipulation skills by using adversarial motion priors, which we name HMAMP. The approach leverages adversarial networks to model the complex dynamics of tool and object manipulation, as well as the aim of the manipulation task. The discriminator is trained using a combination of real-world data and simulation data executed by the agent, which is designed to train a policy that generates realistic motion trajectories that match the statistical properties of human motion. We evaluated HMAMP on one challenging manipulation task: hammering, and the results indicate that HMAMP is capable of learning human-style manipulation skills that outperform current baseline methods. Additionally, we demonstrate that HMAMP has potential for real-world applications by performing real robot arm hammering tasks. In general, HMAMP represents a significant step towards developing robots and autonomous systems that can interact with humans in a more natural and intuitive way, by learning to manipulate tools and objects in a manner similar to how humans do.

Abstract: Emergent symbolic representations are critical for enabling developmental learning agents to plan and generalize across tasks. In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can translate human natural language instructions into the internal symbolic representations that emerge during hierarchical reinforcement learning. We apply a structured evaluation framework to measure the translation performance of commonly seen LLMs -- GPT, Claude, Deepseek and Grok -- across different internal symbolic partitions generated by a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm in the Ant Maze and Ant Fall environments. Our findings reveal that although LLMs demonstrate some ability to translate natural language into a symbolic representation of the environment dynamics, their performance is highly sensitive to partition granularity and task complexity. The results expose limitations in current LLMs capacity for representation alignment, highlighting the need for further research on robust alignment between language and internal agent representations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools to perform complex, realistic tasks, yet their ability to utilize the rapidly expanding Model Contextual Protocol (MCP) ecosystem remains limited. Existing MCP research covers few servers, depends on costly manual curation, and lacks training support, hindering progress toward real-world deployment. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MCP-Flow, an automated web-agent-driven pipeline for large-scale server discovery, data synthesis, and model training. MCP-Flow collects and filters data from 1166 servers and 11536 tools, producing 68733 high-quality instruction-function call pairs and 6439 trajectories, far exceeding prior work in scale and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate MCP-Flow's effectiveness in driving superior MCP tool selection, function-call generation, and enhanced agentic task performance. MCP-Flow thus provides a scalable foundation for advancing LLM agents' proficiency in real-world MCP environments. MCP-Flow is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/wwh0411/MCP-Flow}{https://github.com/wwh0411/MCP-Flow}.

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events based on human judgment. This task can be seen as a form of claim verification, where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims, represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs; (2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM) from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents, extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of evidence for claim verification.

Abstract: Cybersecurity spans multiple interconnected domains, complicating the development of meaningful, labor-relevant benchmarks. Existing benchmarks assess isolated skills rather than integrated performance. We find that pre-trained knowledge of cybersecurity in LLMs does not imply attack and defense abilities, revealing a gap between knowledge and capability. To address this limitation, we present the Cybersecurity AI Benchmark (CAIBench), a modular meta-benchmark framework that allows evaluating LLM models and agents across offensive and defensive cybersecurity domains, taking a step towards meaningfully measuring their labor-relevance. CAIBench integrates five evaluation categories, covering over 10,000 instances: Jeopardy-style CTFs, Attack and Defense CTFs, Cyber Range exercises, knowledge benchmarks, and privacy assessments. Key novel contributions include systematic simultaneous offensive-defensive evaluation, robotics-focused cybersecurity challenges (RCTF2), and privacy-preserving performance assessment (CyberPII-Bench). Evaluation of state-of-the-art AI models reveals saturation on security knowledge metrics (~70\% success) but substantial degradation in multi-step adversarial (A\&amp;D) scenarios (20-40\% success), or worse in robotic targets (22\% success). The combination of framework scaffolding and LLM model choice significantly impacts performance; we find that proper matches improve up to 2.6$\times$ variance in Attack and Defense CTFs. These results demonstrate a pronounced gap between conceptual knowledge and adaptive capability, emphasizing the need for a meta-benchmark.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into data science workflows for automated system design. However, these LLM-driven data science systems rely solely on the internal reasoning of LLMs, lacking guidance from scientific and theoretical principles. This limits their trustworthiness and robustness, especially when dealing with noisy and complex real-world datasets. This paper provides VDSAgents, a multi-agent system grounded in the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles proposed in the Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework. Guided by PCS principles, the system implements a modular workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation. Each phase is handled by an elegant agent, incorporating perturbation analysis, unit testing, and model validation to ensure both functionality and scientific auditability. We evaluate VDSAgents on nine datasets with diverse characteristics, comparing it with state-of-the-art end-to-end data science systems, such as AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, using DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o as backends. VDSAgents consistently outperforms the results of AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, which validates the feasibility of embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven data science automation.

<title>Perception Learning: A Formal Separation of Sensory Representation Learning from Decision Learning</title>

Abstract: We introduce Perception Learning (PeL), a paradigm that optimizes an agent's sensory interface $f_\phi:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Z}$ using task-agnostic signals, decoupled from downstream decision learning $g_\theta:\mathcal{Z}\to\mathcal{Y}$. PeL directly targets label-free perceptual properties, such as stability to nuisances, informativeness without collapse, and controlled geometry, assessed via objective representation-invariant metrics. We formalize the separation of perception and decision, define perceptual properties independent of objectives or reparameterizations, and prove that PeL updates preserving sufficient invariants are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients. Additionally, we provide a suite of task-agnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in code agents have enabled automated software development at the project level, supported by large language models (LLMs) and widely adopted tools. However, existing benchmarks for code agent evaluation face two major limitations: high annotation cost and expertise requirements, and rigid evaluation metrics that rely primarily on unit tests. To address these challenges, we propose an agent-driven benchmark construction pipeline that leverages human supervision to efficiently generate diverse and challenging project-level tasks. Based on this approach, we introduce PRDBench, a novel benchmark comprising 50 real-world Python projects across 20 domains, each with structured Product Requirement Document (PRD) requirements, comprehensive evaluation criteria, and reference implementations. PRDBench features rich data sources, high task complexity, and flexible metrics. We further employ an Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm to score agent outputs, enabling the evaluation of various test types beyond unit tests. Extensive experiments on PRDBench demonstrate its effectiveness in assessing the capabilities of both code agents and evaluation agents, providing a scalable and robust framework for annotation and evaluation.

<title>An N-of-1 Artificial Intelligence Ecosystem for Precision Medicine</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants, multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs. Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the individual.

arXiv:2510.24383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy Cards are introduced as a machine-readable, deployment-layer standard for expressing operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents. The Policy Card sits with the agent and enables it to follow required constraints at runtime. It tells the agent what it must and must not do. As such, it becomes an integral part of the deployed agent. Policy Cards extend existing transparency artifacts such as Model, Data, and System Cards by defining a normative layer that encodes allow/deny rules, obligations, evidentiary requirements, and crosswalk mappings to assurance frameworks including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and the EU AI Act. Each Policy Card can be validated automatically, version-controlled, and linked to runtime enforcement or continuous-audit pipelines. The framework enables verifiable compliance for autonomous agents, forming a foundation for distributed assurance in multi-agent ecosystems. Policy Cards provide a practical mechanism for integrating high-level governance with hands-on engineering practice and enabling accountable autonomy at scale.

<title>Improving LLM Reasoning via Dependency-Aware Query Decomposition and Logic-Parallel Content Expansion</title>

arXiv:2510.24390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-time Web applications, such as AI-powered search and conversational agents, presents a fundamental Web infrastructure challenge: reconciling the demand for high-quality, complex reasoning with the stringent low-latency and high-throughput requirements of interactive services. Current LLM reasoning, hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services. Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1) \textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \textit{content parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\ie, efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75% through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.

<title>APTBench: Benchmarking Agentic Potential of Base LLMs During Pre-Training</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24397</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24397</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.24397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, there is a growing trend to incorporate agent-specific data into the pre-training stage of LLMs, aiming to better align LLMs with real-world autonomous task execution. However, current pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g., common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench, a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations after post-training.

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

<title>CodeWiki: Automated Repository-Level Documentation at Scale</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.24428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developers spend nearly 58% of their time understanding codebases, yet maintaining comprehensive documentation remains challenging due to complexity and manual effort. While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for function-level documentation, they fail at the repository level, where capturing architectural patterns and cross-module interactions is essential. We introduce CodeWiki, the first open-source framework for holistic repository-level documentation across seven programming languages. CodeWiki employs three innovations: (i) hierarchical decomposition that preserves architectural context, (ii) recursive agentic processing with dynamic delegation, and (iii) synthesis of textual and visual artifacts including architecture diagrams and data flows. We also present CodeWikiBench, the first repository-level documentation benchmark with multi-level rubrics and agentic assessment. CodeWiki achieves 68.79% quality score with proprietary models and 64.80% with open-source alternatives, outperforming existing closed-source systems and demonstrating scalable, accurate documentation for real-world repositories.

<title>Fill in the Blanks: Accelerating Q-Learning with a Handful of Demonstrations in Sparse Reward Settings</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.24432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in sparse-reward environments remains a significant challenge due to the lack of informative feedback. We propose a simple yet effective method that uses a small number of successful demonstrations to initialize the value function of an RL agent. By precomputing value estimates from offline demonstrations and using them as targets for early learning, our approach provides the agent with a useful prior over promising actions. The agent then refines these estimates through standard online interaction. This hybrid offline-to-online paradigm significantly reduces the exploration burden and improves sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings. Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our method accelerates convergence and outperforms standard baselines, even with minimal or suboptimal demonstration data.

<title>Can LLMs Write Faithfully? An Agent-Based Evaluation of LLM-generated Islamic Content</title>

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for Islamic guidance, but risk misquoting texts, misapplying jurisprudence, or producing culturally inconsistent responses. We pilot an evaluation of GPT-4o, Ansari AI, and Fanar on prompts from authentic Islamic blogs. Our dual-agent framework uses a quantitative agent for citation verification and six-dimensional scoring (e.g., Structure, Islamic Consistency, Citations) and a qualitative agent for five-dimensional side-by-side comparison (e.g., Tone, Depth, Originality). GPT-4o scored highest in Islamic Accuracy (3.93) and Citation (3.38), Ansari AI followed (3.68, 3.32), and Fanar lagged (2.76, 1.82). Despite relatively strong performance, models still fall short in reliably producing accurate Islamic content and citations -- a paramount requirement in faith-sensitive writing. GPT-4o had the highest mean quantitative score (3.90/5), while Ansari AI led qualitative pairwise wins (116/200). Fanar, though trailing, introduces innovations for Islamic and Arabic contexts. This study underscores the need for community-driven benchmarks centering Muslim perspectives, offering an early step toward more reliable AI in Islamic knowledge and other high-stakes domains such as medicine, law, and journalism.

Abstract: Since real-world legal experiments are often costly or infeasible, simulating legal societies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provides an effective alternative for verifying and developing legal theory, as well as supporting legal administration. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico, an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.

Abstract: The autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that defines their digital environment, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) of web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services. However, constructing this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations prevents agents from adapting to evolving services.
  This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently construct and maintain an accurate world model, enabling scalable, adaptive, and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources.

arXiv:2510.24515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) generalizes many real-world multi-robot scheduling and routing tasks that occur in autonomous mobility, aerial logistics, and surveillance applications. While many flavors of the TOP exist for planning in multi-robot systems, they assume that all the robots cooperate toward a single objective; thus, they do not extend to settings where the robots compete in reward-scarce environments. We propose Stochastic Prize-Collecting Games (SPCG) as an extension of the TOP to plan in the presence of self-interested robots operating on a graph, under energy constraints and stochastic transitions. A theoretical study on complete and star graphs establishes that there is a unique pure Nash equilibrium in SPCGs that coincides with the optimal routing solution of an equivalent TOP given a rank-based conflict resolution rule. This work proposes two algorithms: Ordinal Rank Search (ORS) to obtain the ''ordinal rank'' --one's effective rank in temporarily-formed local neighborhoods during the games' stages, and Fictitious Ordinal Response Learning (FORL) to obtain best-response policies against one's senior-rank opponents. Empirical evaluations conducted on road networks and synthetic graphs under both dynamic and stationary prize distributions show that 1) the state-aliasing induced by OR-conditioning enables learning policies that scale more efficiently to large team sizes than those trained with the global index, and 2) Policies trained with FORL generalize better to imbalanced prize distributions than those with other multi-agent training methods. Finally, the learned policies in the SPCG achieved between 87% and 95% optimality compared to an equivalent TOP solution obtained by mixed-integer linear programming.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is taking the world by storm. It promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the deployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.24563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With advances in decision-making and reasoning capabilities, multimodal agents show strong potential in computer application scenarios. Past evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP, the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents' tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1% to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet at 50 steps), underscoring the importance of assessing tool invocation capabilities. However, even the strongest models have relatively low tool invocation rates, Only 36.3%, indicating room for improvement and highlighting the benchmark's challenge. By explicitly measuring MCP tool usage skills, OSWorld-MCP deepens understanding of multimodal agents and sets a new standard for evaluating performance in complex, tool-assisted environments. Our code, environment, and data are publicly available at https://osworld-mcp.github.io.

Abstract: Frontier AI agents show increasing promise as scientific research assistants, and may eventually be useful for extended, open-ended research workflows. However, in order to use agents for novel research, we must first assess the underlying faithfulness and correctness of their work. To evaluate agents as research assistants, we introduce ReplicationBench, an evaluation framework that tests whether agents can replicate entire research papers drawn from the astrophysics literature. Astrophysics, where research relies heavily on archival data and computational study while requiring little real-world experimentation, is a particularly useful testbed for AI agents in scientific research. We split each paper into tasks which require agents to replicate the paper's core contributions, including the experimental setup, derivations, data analysis, and codebase. Each task is co-developed with the original paper authors and targets a key scientific result, enabling objective evaluation of both faithfulness (adherence to original methods) and correctness (technical accuracy of results). ReplicationBench is extremely challenging for current frontier language models: even the best-performing language models score under 20%. We analyze ReplicationBench trajectories in collaboration with domain experts and find a rich, diverse set of failure modes for agents in scientific research. ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark of paper-scale, expert-validated astrophysics research tasks, reveals insights about agent performance generalizable to other domains of data-driven science, and provides a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific research.

<title>Strategic Task Offloading for Delay-Sensitive IoT Applications: A Game-Theory-Based Demand-Supply Mechanism with Participation Incentives</title>

Abstract: Delay-sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) applications have drawn significant attention. Running many of these applications on IoT devices is challenging due to the limited processing resources of these devices and the need for real-time responses. Task offloading can minimize latency by transferring computationally intensive tasks from IoT devices to resource-rich edge servers, ensuring delay and performance guarantees. In this paper, we develop a task-offloading approach for delay-sensitive IoT applications in edge computing environments. Unlike existing schemes, we model the task offloading problem as an economic demand and supply model to achieve market balance. The proposed model avoids under- and over-supply, ensuring the computational resources at edge servers (supply) are allocated in a manner that best meets the processing and computational needs of user devices (demand). Given the multi-agent nature of task offloading involving users and service providers with different preferences and objectives, we design a game-theoretic framework using a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction. This framework analyzes agent interactions and decision-making processes. Additionally, we develop an incentive mechanism to encourage both parties to participate in the auction. The mechanism maximizes user task offloading to edge servers and motivates edge servers to share their computational resources, achieving profitability for both IoT users and edge servers. Simulations demonstrate our method maximizes social welfare, ensures truthfulness, maintains market balance, and provides latency guarantees for delay-sensitive IoT applications.

<title>FunReason-MT Technical Report: Overcoming the Complexity Barrier in Multi-Turn Function Calling</title>

arXiv:2510.24645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods, such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments. Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a reliable and robust source for agentic learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for training large language models (LLMs) as diagnostic agents with reinforcement learning, enabling them to manage multi-turn diagnostic processes, adaptively select examinations, and commit to final diagnoses. Unlike instruction-tuned models trained on static case summaries, our method acquires diagnostic strategies through interactive exploration and outcome-based feedback. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We present DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health records that emits examination outcomes conditioned on patient history and recommended examination, serving as a virtual clinical environment for realistic diagnosis training and evaluation; (ii) We train DiagAgent via end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning to learn diagnostic policies that optimize both information yield and diagnostic accuracy; (iii) We introduce DiagBench, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 750 cases with physician-validated examination recommendations and 99 cases annotated with 973 physician-written rubrics on diagnosis process; (iv) we demonstrate superior performance across diverse diagnostic settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, as well as two prompt-engineered agents. In single-turn settings, DiagAgent achieves 9.34% higher diagnostic accuracy and 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation hit ratio. In end-to-end settings, it delivers 15.12% increase in diagnostic accuracy and 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score. In rubric-based evaluation, it surpasses the next-best model, Claude-sonnet-4, by 7.1% in weighted rubric score. These findings indicate that learning policies in interactive clinical environments confers dynamic and clinically meaningful diagnostic management abilities unattainable through passive training alone.

Abstract: Agentic tool use has gained traction with the rise of agentic tool calling, yet most existing work overlooks the complexity of multi-turn tool interactions. We introduce OrchDAG, a synthetic data generation pipeline that models tool execution as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with controllable complexity. Using this dataset, we benchmark model performance and propose a graph-based reward to enhance RLVR training. Experiments show that the dataset presents a challenging but solvable benchmark, and the proposed reward is effective when combined with GRPO-style algorithms, highlighting the importance of leveraging topological structure and data complexity in multi-turn tool use.

<title>InteractComp: Evaluating Search Agents With Ambiguous Queries</title>

Abstract: Language agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in web search and information retrieval. However, these search agents assume user queries are complete and unambiguous, an assumption that diverges from reality where users begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Yet most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing benchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce InteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search. Following the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we construct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only through interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best model achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context, exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced interaction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current strategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold, revealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate feedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents. The code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/InteractComp.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of intelligent driving functions into serial-produced vehicles, ensuring their functionality and robustness poses greater challenges. Compared to traditional road testing, scenario-based virtual testing offers significant advantages in terms of time and cost efficiency, reproducibility, and exploration of edge cases. We propose a Transformer-enhanced Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE-T) model for generating multi-agent traffic scenarios in roundabouts, which are characterized by high vehicle dynamics and complex layouts, yet remain relatively underexplored in current research. The results show that the proposed model can accurately reconstruct original scenarios and generate realistic, diverse synthetic scenarios. Besides, two Key-Performance-Indicators (KPIs) are employed to evaluate the interactive behavior in the generated scenarios. Analysis of the latent space reveals partial disentanglement, with several latent dimensions exhibiting distinct and interpretable effects on scenario attributes such as vehicle entry timing, exit timing, and velocity profiles. The results demonstrate the model's capability to generate scenarios for the validation of intelligent driving functions involving multi-agent interactions, as well as to augment data for their development and iterative improvement.

<title>Repurposing Synthetic Data for Fine-grained Search Agent Supervision</title>

Abstract: LLM-based search agents are increasingly trained on entity-centric synthetic data to solve complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, prevailing training methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative "near-miss" samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to effectively learn from these "near-misses". Experiments on diverse question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls, demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search agents.

Abstract: Training large language model agents on tasks at the frontier of their capabilities is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. We introduce a data synthesis approach inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which defines this frontier as tasks an LLM cannot solve alone but can master with guidance. To operationalize this, we present the AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality, multidisciplinary data situated precisely within the LLM's ZPD. This engine supports both continued pre-training with knowledge-intensive data and targeted post-training on complex reasoning tasks. From the same framework, we derive the ZPD Exam, a dynamic and automated benchmark designed to evaluate agent capabilities on these frontier tasks. We train AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model on our synthesized data, which achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, even surpassing some leading proprietary agents. Our work demonstrates that a ZPD-guided approach to data synthesis offers a scalable and effective path toward building more capable LLM agents.

<title>WebLeaper: Empowering Efficiency and Efficacy in WebAgent via Enabling Info-Rich Seeking</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a transformative approach for open-ended problem solving, with information seeking (IS) being a core capability that enables autonomous reasoning and decision-making. While prior research has largely focused on improving retrieval depth, we observe that current IS agents often suffer from low search efficiency, which in turn constrains overall performance. A key factor underlying this inefficiency is the sparsity of target entities in training tasks, which limits opportunities for agents to learn and generalize efficient search behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose WebLeaper, a framework for constructing high-coverage IS tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories. We formulate IS as a tree-structured reasoning problem, enabling a substantially larger set of target entities to be embedded within a constrained context. Leveraging curated Wikipedia tables, we propose three variants for synthesizing IS tasks, Basic, Union, and Reverse-Union, to systematically increase both IS efficiency and efficacy. Finally, we curate training trajectories by retaining only those that are simultaneously accurate and efficient, ensuring that the model is optimized for both correctness and search performance. Extensive experiments on both basic and comprehensive settings, conducted on five IS benchmarks, BrowserComp, GAIA, xbench-DeepSearch, WideSearch, and Seal-0, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over strong baselines.

arXiv:2510.24698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel thinking expands exploration breadth, complementing the deep exploration of information-seeking (IS) agents to further enhance problem-solving capability. However, conventional parallel thinking faces two key challenges in this setting: inefficiency from repeatedly rolling out from scratch, and difficulty in integrating long-horizon reasoning trajectories during answer generation, as limited context capacity prevents full consideration of the reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose ParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm designed for deep IS agents. The first stage, Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout, partitions generated sequences into functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and branching to enhance exploration efficiency. The second stage, Compressed Reasoning Aggregation, exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress information relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final answer. Experiments across multiple open-source agents and benchmarks demonstrate up to 62% performance improvement with a 10--30% reduction in exploratory token consumption.

<title>AgentFold: Long-Horizon Web Agents with Proactive Context Management</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24699</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.24699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based web agents show immense promise for information seeking, yet their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks is hindered by a fundamental trade-off in context management. Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context saturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical details. Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm centered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive process of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log to be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular condensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations to abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks. The results on prominent benchmarks are striking: with simple supervised fine-tuning (without continual pre-training or RL), our AgentFold-30B-A3B agent achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH. Notably, this performance not only surpasses or matches open-source models of a dramatically larger scale, such as the DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B, but also surpasses leading proprietary agents like OpenAI's o4-mini.

<title>Agent Data Protocol: Unifying Datasets for Diverse, Effective Fine-tuning of LLM Agents</title>

arXiv:2510.24702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public research results on large-scale supervised finetuning of AI agents remain relatively rare, since the collection of agent training data presents unique challenges. In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of underlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the agent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves as an "interlingua" between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent training pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding, software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments, we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an average performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool use, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning. All code and data are released publicly, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training.

Abstract: Understanding how individual learning behavior and structural dynamics interact is essential to modeling emergent phenomena in socioeconomic networks. While bounded rationality and network adaptation have been widely studied, the role of heterogeneous learning rates both at the agent and network levels remains under explored. This paper introduces a dual-learning framework that integrates individualized learning rates for agents and a rewiring rate for the network, reflecting real-world cognitive diversity and structural adaptability.
  Using a simulation model based on the Prisoner's Dilemma and Quantal Response Equilibrium, we analyze how variations in these learning rates affect the emergence of large-scale network structures. Results show that lower and more homogeneously distributed learning rates promote scale-free networks, while higher or more heterogeneously distributed learning rates lead to the emergence of core-periphery topologies. Key topological metrics including scale-free exponents, Estrada heterogeneity, and assortativity reveal that both the speed and variability of learning critically shape system rationality and network architecture. This work provides a unified framework for examining how individual learnability and structural adaptability drive the formation of socioeconomic networks with diverse topologies, offering new insights into adaptive behavior, systemic organization, and resilience.

<title>Distributed Stochastic Momentum Tracking with Local Updates: Achieving Optimal Communication and Iteration Complexities</title>

Abstract: We propose Local Momentum Tracking (LMT), a novel distributed stochastic gradient method for solving distributed optimization problems over networks. To reduce communication overhead, LMT enables each agent to perform multiple local updates between consecutive communication rounds. Specifically, LMT integrates local updates with the momentum tracking strategy and the Loopless Chebyshev Acceleration (LCA) technique. We demonstrate that LMT achieves linear speedup with respect to the number of local updates as well as the number of agents for minimizing smooth objective functions. Moreover, with sufficiently many local updates ($Q\geq Q^*$), LMT attains the optimal communication complexity. For a moderate number of local updates ($Q\in[1,Q^*]$), it achieves the optimal iteration complexity. To our knowledge, LMT is the first method that enjoys such properties.

<title>Towards actionable hypotension prediction -- predicting catecholamine therapy initiation in the intensive care unit</title>

Abstract: Hypotension in critically ill ICU patients is common and life-threatening. Escalation to catecholamine therapy marks a key management step, with both undertreatment and overtreatment posing risks. Most machine learning (ML) models predict hypotension using fixed MAP thresholds or MAP forecasting, overlooking the clinical decision behind treatment escalation. Predicting catecholamine initiation, the start of vasoactive or inotropic agent administration offers a more clinically actionable target reflecting real decision-making. Using the MIMIC-III database, we modeled catecholamine initiation as a binary event within a 15-minute prediction window. Input features included statistical descriptors from a two-hour sliding MAP context window, along with demographics, biometrics, comorbidities, and ongoing treatments. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was trained and interpreted via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The model achieved an AUROC of 0.822 (0.813-0.830), outperforming the hypotension baseline (MAP < 65, AUROC 0.686 [0.675-0.699]). SHAP analysis highlighted recent MAP values, MAP trends, and ongoing treatments (e.g., sedatives, electrolytes) as dominant predictors. Subgroup analysis showed higher performance in males, younger patients (<53 years), those with higher BMI (>32), and patients without comorbidities or concurrent medications. Predicting catecholamine initiation based on MAP dynamics, treatment context, and patient characteristics supports the critical decision of when to escalate therapy, shifting focus from threshold-based alarms to actionable decision support. This approach is feasible across a broad ICU cohort under natural event imbalance. Future work should enrich temporal and physiological context, extend label definitions to include therapy escalation, and benchmark against existing hypotension prediction systems.

Abstract: Collective adaptation, whether in innovation adoption, pro-environmental or organizational change, emerges from the interplay between individual decisions and social influence. Agent-based modeling provides a useful tool for studying such processes. Here, we introduce the biased-independence $q$-voter model, a generalization of the $q$-voter model with independence, one of the most popular agent-based models of opinion dynamics. In our model, individuals choose between two options, adopt or not adopt, under the competing influences of conformity and independent choice. Independent choice between two options is determined by an engagement parameter, inspired by earlier agent-based model of eco-innovation diffusion. When the engagement parameter equals $0.5$, the model reduces to the original $q$-voter model with independence; values different from $0.5$ break the symmetry between the two options. To place our study in a broader context, we briefly review asymmetric versions of the $q$-voter model proposed to date. The novelty of this work goes beyond introducing a generalized model: we develop the pair approximation (PA) for an asymmetric $q$-voter model and, for the first time, validate it on empirical organizational networks. Our results show that the interplay of social influence, independence, and option preference generates discontinuous phase transitions and irreversible hysteresis, reflecting path-dependent adoption dynamics. Surprisingly, the PA agrees well with Monte Carlo simulations on some empirical networks, even small ones, highlighting its potential as a computationally efficient bridge between individual decision-making and collective actions.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the module-checking problem of pushdown multi-agent systems (PMS) against ATL and ATL* specifications. We establish that for ATL, module checking of PMS is 2EXPTIME-complete, which is the same complexity as pushdown module-checking for CTL. On the other hand, we show that ATL* module-checking of PMS turns out to be 4EXPTIME-complete, hence exponentially harder than both CTL* pushdown module-checking and ATL* model-checking of PMS. Our result for ATL* provides a rare example of a natural decision problem that is elementary yet but with a complexity that is higher than triply exponential-time.

Abstract: Game environments provide rich, controllable settings that stimulate many aspects of real-world complexity. As such, game agents offer a valuable testbed for exploring capabilities relevant to Artificial General Intelligence. Recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides new opportunities to endow these agents with generalizable reasoning, memory, and adaptability in complex game environments. This survey offers an up-to-date review of LLM-based game agents (LLMGAs) through a unified reference architecture. At the single-agent level, we synthesize existing studies around three core components: memory, reasoning, and perception-action interfaces, which jointly characterize how language enables agents to perceive, think, and act. At the multi-agent level, we outline how communication protocols and organizational models support coordination, role differentiation, and large-scale social behaviors. To contextualize these designs, we introduce a challenge-centered taxonomy linking six major game genres to their dominant agent requirements, from low-latency control in action games to open-ended goal formation in sandbox worlds.

Abstract: We introduce GRS (Generating Robotic Simulation tasks), a system addressing real-to-sim for robotic simulations. GRS creates digital twin simulations from single RGB-D observations with solvable tasks for virtual agent training. Using vision-language models (VLMs), our pipeline operates in three stages: 1) scene comprehension with SAM2 for segmentation and object description, 2) matching objects with simulation-ready assets, and 3) generating appropriate tasks. We ensure simulation-task alignment through generated test suites and introduce a router that iteratively refines both simulation and test code. Experiments demonstrate our system's effectiveness in object correspondence and task environment generation through our novel router mechanism.

Abstract: Nash equilibrium is a central solution concept for reasoning about self-interested agents. We address the problem of synthesizing Nash equilibria in two-player deterministic games on graphs, where players have private, partially-ordered preferences over temporal goals. Unlike prior work, which assumes preferences are common knowledge, we develop a communication protocol for equilibrium synthesis in settings where players' preferences are private information. In the protocol, players communicate to synthesize equilibria by exchanging information about when they can force desirable outcomes. We incorporate privacy by ensuring the protocol stops before enough information is revealed to expose a player's preferences. We prove completeness by showing that, when no player halts communication, the protocol either returns an equilibrium or certifies that none exists. We then prove privacy by showing that, with stopping, the messages a player sends are always consistent with multiple possible preferences and thus do not reveal some given secret regarding a player's true preference ordering. Experiments demonstrate that we can synthesize non-trivial equilibria while preserving privacy of preferences, highlighting the protocol's potential for applications in strategy synthesis with constrained information sharing.

Abstract: When deployed in the real world, AI agents will inevitably face challenges that exceed their individual capabilities. Leveraging assistance from experts, whether humans or highly capable AI systems, can significantly improve both safety and performance in such situations. Since expert assistance is costly, a central challenge is determining when to consult an expert. In this paper, we explore a novel variant of this problem, termed YRC-0, in which an agent must learn to collaborate with an expert in new environments in an unsupervised manner--that is, without interacting with the expert during training. This setting motivates the development of low-cost, robust approaches for training expert-leveraging agents. To support research in this area, we introduce YRC-Bench, an open-source benchmark that instantiates YRC-0 across diverse environments. YRC-Bench provides a standardized Gym-like API, simulated experts, an evaluation pipeline, and implementations of popular baselines. Toward tackling YRC-0, we propose a validation strategy and evaluate a range of learning methods, offering insights that can inform future research. Codebase: github.com/modanesh/YRC-Bench

Abstract: Humans leverage rich internal models of the world to reason about the future, imagine counterfactuals, and adapt flexibly to new situations. In Reinforcement Learning (RL), world models aim to capture how the environment evolves in response to the agent's actions, facilitating planning and generalization. However, typical world models directly operate on the environment variables (e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make their training slow and cumbersome; instead, it may be advantageous to rely on high-level latent dimensions that capture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace (GW) Theory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information broadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient deep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an RL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with various versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We show that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the GW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps. As an additional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its comparison baselines) displays strong robustness to the absence of one of its observation modalities (images or simulation attributes). We conclude that the combination of GW with World Models holds great potential for improving decision-making in RL agents.

<title>Benchmarking AI Models in Software Engineering: A Review, Search Tool, and Unified Approach for Elevating Benchmark Quality</title>

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for unified evaluation and reproducibility. The rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering (AI4SE) has produced numerous benchmarks for tasks such as code generation and bug repair. However, this proliferation has led to major challenges: (1) fragmented knowledge across tasks, (2) difficulty in selecting contextually relevant benchmarks, (3) lack of standardization in benchmark creation, and (4) flaws that limit utility. Addressing these requires a dual approach: systematically mapping existing benchmarks for informed selection and defining unified guidelines for robust, adaptable benchmark development.
  We conduct a review of 247 studies, identifying 273 AI4SE benchmarks since 2014. We categorize them, analyze limitations, and expose gaps in current practices. Building on these insights, we introduce BenchScout, an extensible semantic search tool for locating suitable benchmarks. BenchScout employs automated clustering with contextual embeddings of benchmark-related studies, followed by dimensionality reduction. In a user study with 22 participants, BenchScout achieved usability, effectiveness, and intuitiveness scores of 4.5, 4.0, and 4.1 out of 5.
  To improve benchmarking standards, we propose BenchFrame, a unified framework for enhancing benchmark quality. Applying BenchFrame to HumanEval yielded HumanEvalNext, featuring corrected errors, improved language conversion, higher test coverage, and greater difficulty. Evaluating 10 state-of-the-art code models on HumanEval, HumanEvalPlus, and HumanEvalNext revealed average pass-at-1 drops of 31.22% and 19.94%, respectively, underscoring the need for continuous benchmark refinement. We further examine BenchFrame's scalability through an agentic pipeline and confirm its generalizability on the MBPP dataset. All review data, user study materials, and enhanced benchmarks are publicly released.

<title>The Limits of Fairness of the Variational Generalized Nash Equilibrium</title>

Abstract: Generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) problems are commonly used to model strategic interactions between self-interested agents who are coupled in cost and constraints. Specifically, the variational GNE, a refinement of the GNE, is often selected as the solution concept due to its non-discriminatory treatment of agents by charging a uniform ``shadow price" for shared resources. We study the fairness concept of v-GNEs from a comparability perspective and show that it makes an implicit assumption of unit comparability of agent's cost functions, one of the strongest comparability notions. Further, we introduce a new solution concept, f-GNE in which a fairness metric is chosen a priori which is compatible with the comparability at hand. We introduce an electric vehicle charging game to demonstrate the fragility of v-GNE fairness and compare it to the f-GNE under various fairness metrics.

<title>Group-in-Group Policy Optimization for LLM Agent Training</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in group-based reinforcement learning (RL) have driven frontier large language models (LLMs) in single-turn tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, their scalability to multi-turn LLM agent training remains limited. Unlike static tasks, agent-environment interactions unfold over many steps and often yield sparse or delayed rewards, making credit assignment across individual steps significantly more challenging. In this work, we propose Group-in-Group Policy Optimization (GiGPO), a novel RL algorithm that achieves fine-grained credit assignment for LLM agents while preserving the appealing properties of group-based RL: critic-free, low memory, and stable convergence. GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level, GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together, enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We evaluate GiGPO on challenging agent benchmarks, including ALFWorld and WebShop, as well as tool-integrated reasoning on search-augmented QA tasks, using Qwen2.5-1.5B/3B/7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers fine-grained per-step credit signals, achieves performance gains of > 12% on ALFWorld and > 9% on WebShop over GRPO, and obtains superior performance on QA tasks (42.1% on 3B and 47.2% on 7B): all while maintaining the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no additional time cost.

Abstract: Humans are remarkably adept at collaboration, able to infer the strengths and weaknesses of new partners in order to work successfully towards shared goals. To build AI systems with this capability, we must first understand its building blocks: does such flexibility require explicit, dedicated mechanisms for modelling others -- or can it emerge spontaneously from the pressures of open-ended cooperative interaction? To investigate this question, we train simple model-free RNN agents to collaborate with a population of diverse partners. Using the `Overcooked-AI' environment, we collect data from thousands of collaborative teams, and analyse agents' internal hidden states. Despite a lack of additional architectural features, inductive biases, or auxiliary objectives, the agents nevertheless develop structured internal representations of their partners' task abilities, enabling rapid adaptation and generalisation to novel collaborators. We investigated these internal models through probing techniques, and large-scale behavioural analysis. Notably, we find that structured partner modelling emerges when agents can influence partner behaviour by controlling task allocation. Our results show that partner modelling can arise spontaneously in model-free agents -- but only under environmental conditions that impose the right kind of social pressure.

Abstract: Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) promise to reduce congestion in future urban networks, potentially by optimizing their routing decisions. Unlike for human drivers, these decisions can be made with collective, data-driven policies, developed using machine learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning (RL) can facilitate the development of such collective routing strategies, yet standardized and realistic benchmarks are missing. To that end, we present URB: Urban Routing Benchmark for RL-equipped Connected Autonomous Vehicles. URB is a comprehensive benchmarking environment that unifies evaluation across 29 real-world traffic networks paired with realistic demand patterns. URB comes with a catalog of predefined tasks, multi-agent RL (MARL) algorithm implementations, three baseline methods, domain-specific performance metrics, and a modular configuration scheme. Our results show that, despite the lengthy and costly training, state-of-the-art MARL algorithms rarely outperformed humans. The experimental results reported in this paper initiate the first leaderboard for MARL in large-scale urban routing optimization. They reveal that current approaches struggle to scale, emphasizing the urgent need for advancements in this domain.

<title>CPathAgent: An Agent-based Foundation Model for Interpretable High-Resolution Pathology Image Analysis Mimicking Pathologists' Diagnostic Logic</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology have led to the emergence of numerous foundation models. These models typically rely on general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for whole slide image (WSI) classification or apply multimodal approaches to generate reports directly from images. However, these models cannot emulate the diagnostic approach of pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification to obtain an overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. Instead, existing models directly output final diagnoses without revealing the underlying reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based approach that mimics pathologists' diagnostic workflow by autonomously navigating across WSI based on observed visual features, thereby generating substantially more transparent and interpretable diagnostic summaries. To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy that unifies patch-level, region-level, and WSI-level capabilities within a single model, which is essential for replicating how pathologists understand and reason across diverse image scales. Additionally, we construct PathMMU-HR2, the first expert-validated benchmark for large region analysis. This represents a critical intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, reflecting a key clinical reality where pathologists typically examine several key large regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across benchmarks at three different image scales, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for computational pathology.

Abstract: The alignment between humans and machines is a critical challenge in artificial intelligence today. Reinforcement learning, which aims to maximize a reward function, is particularly vulnerable to the risks associated with poorly designed reward functions. Recent advancements has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) for reward generation can outperform human performance in this context. We introduce VIRAL, a pipeline for generating and refining reward functions through the use of multi-modal LLMs. VIRAL autonomously creates and interactively improves reward functions based on a given environment and a goal prompt or annotated image. The refinement process can incorporate human feedback or be guided by a description generated by a video LLM, which explains the agent's policy in video form. We evaluated VIRAL in five Gymnasium environments, demonstrating that it accelerates the learning of new behaviors while ensuring improved alignment with user intent. The source-code and demo video are available at: https://github.com/VIRAL-UCBL1/VIRAL and https://youtu.be/Hqo82CxVT38.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a variant of RL where the policy is learned from a previously collected dataset of trajectories and rewards. In our work, we propose a practical approach to offline RL with large language models (LLMs). We recast the problem as reward-weighted fine-tuning, which can be solved using similar techniques to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). To showcase the value of our approach, we apply it to learning short-horizon question-answering policies of a fixed length, where the agent reasons about potential answers or asks clarifying questions. Our work stands in a stark contrast to state-of-the-art methods in this domain, based on SFT and direct preference optimization, which have additional hyper-parameters and do not directly optimize for rewards. We compare to them empirically, and report major gains in both optimized rewards and language quality.

Abstract: The pursuit of human-level artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced the development of autonomous agents and Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs are now widely utilized as decision-making agents for their ability to interpret instructions, manage sequential tasks, and adapt through feedback. This review examines recent developments in employing LLMs as autonomous agents and tool users and comprises seven research questions. We only used the papers published between 2023 and 2025 in conferences of the A* and A rank and Q1 journals. A structured analysis of the LLM agents' architectural design principles, dividing their applications into single-agent and multi-agent systems, and strategies for integrating external tools is presented. In addition, the cognitive mechanisms of LLM, including reasoning, planning, and memory, and the impact of prompting methods and fine-tuning procedures on agent performance are also investigated. Furthermore, we evaluated current benchmarks and assessment protocols and have provided an analysis of 68 publicly available datasets to assess the performance of LLM-based agents in various tasks. In conducting this review, we have identified critical findings on verifiable reasoning of LLMs, the capacity for self-improvement, and the personalization of LLM-based agents. Finally, we have discussed ten future research directions to overcome these gaps.

Abstract: Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are the primary medium for human-computer interaction, yet automating GUI interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of visual elements, dynamic environments, and the need for multi-step reasoning. Existing methods based on vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from limited resolution, domain mismatch, and insufficient sequential decisionmaking capability. To address these issues, we propose Mano, a robust GUI agent built upon a multi-modal foundation model pre-trained on extensive web and computer system data. Our approach integrates a novel simulated environment for high-fidelity data generation, a three-stage training pipeline (supervised fine-tuning, offline reinforcement learning, and online reinforcement learning), and a verification module for error recovery. Mano demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple GUI benchmarks, including Mind2Web and OSWorld, achieving significant improvements in success rate and operational accuracy. Our work provides new insights into the effective integration of reinforcement learning with VLMs for practical GUI agent deployment, highlighting the importance of domain-specific data, iterative training, and holistic reward design.

Abstract: An effective physician should possess a combination of empathy, expertise, patience, and clear communication when treating a patient. Recent advances have successfully endowed AI doctors with expert diagnostic skills, particularly the ability to actively seek information through inquiry. However, other essential qualities of a good doctor remain overlooked. To bridge this gap, we present MAQuE(Medical Agent Questioning Evaluation), the largest-ever benchmark for the automatic and comprehensive evaluation of medical multi-turn questioning. It features 3,000 realistically simulated patient agents that exhibit diverse linguistic patterns, cognitive limitations, emotional responses, and tendencies for passive disclosure. We also introduce a multi-faceted evaluation framework, covering task success, inquiry proficiency, dialogue competence, inquiry efficiency, and patient experience. Experiments on different LLMs reveal substantial challenges across the evaluation aspects. Even state-of-the-art models show significant room for improvement in their inquiry capabilities. These models are highly sensitive to variations in realistic patient behavior, which considerably impacts diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, our fine-grained metrics expose trade-offs between different evaluation perspectives, highlighting the challenge of balancing performance and practicality in real-world clinical settings.

This paper outlines cautions that should be taken when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation, and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, \ie, automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability.

Abstract: We study the problem of long-term (multiple days) mapping of a river plume using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), focusing on the Douro river representative use-case. We propose an energy - and communication - efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning approach in which a central coordinator intermittently communicates with the AUVs, collecting measurements and issuing commands. Our approach integrates spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a multi-head Q-network controller that regulates direction and speed for each AUV. Simulations using the Delft3D ocean model demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent benchmarks, with scaling the number of agents both improving mean squared error (MSE) and operational endurance. In some instances, our algorithm demonstrates that doubling the number of AUVs can more than double endurance while maintaining or improving accuracy, underscoring the benefits of multi-agent coordination. Our learned policies generalize across unseen seasonal regimes over different months and years, demonstrating promise for future developments of data-driven long-term monitoring of dynamic plume environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability, Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn, operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) - Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge, thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Abstract: A novel and fully distributed optimization method is proposed for the distributed robust convex program (DRCP) over a time-varying unbalanced directed network under the uniformly jointly strongly connected (UJSC) assumption. Firstly, an approximated DRCP (ADRCP) is introduced by discretizing the semi-infinite constraints into a finite number of inequality constraints to ensure tractability and restricting the right-hand side of the constraints with a positive parameter to ensure a feasible solution for (DRCP) can be obtained. This problem is iteratively solved by a distributed projected gradient algorithm proposed in this paper, which is based on epigraphic reformulation and gradient projected operations. Secondly, a cutting-surface consensus approach is proposed for locating an approximately optimal consensus solution of the DRCP with guaranteed local feasibility for each agent. This approach is based on iteratively approximating the DRCP by successively reducing the restriction parameter of the right-hand constraints and adding the cutting-surfaces into the existing finite set of constraints. Thirdly, to ensure finite-time termination of the distributed optimization, a distributed termination algorithm is developed based on consensus and zeroth-order stopping conditions under UJSC graphs. Fourthly, it is proved that the cutting-surface consensus approach terminates finitely and yields a feasible and approximate optimal solution for each agent. Finally, the effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through a numerical example.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78% average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%, highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage, often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code and data are available https://github.com/Melmaphother/PaperArena.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) through the dynamic integration of external knowledge. To further improve RAG's flexibility, Agentic RAG introduces autonomous agents into the workflow. However, Agentic RAG faces several challenges: (1) the success of each step depends on both high-quality planning and accurate search, (2) the lack of supervision for intermediate reasoning steps, and (3) the exponentially large candidate space for planning and searching. To address these challenges, we propose DecoupleSearch, a novel framework that decouples planning and search processes using dual value models, enabling independent optimization of plan reasoning and search grounding. Our approach constructs a reasoning tree, where each node represents planning and search steps. We leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search to assess the quality of each step. During inference, Hierarchical Beam Search iteratively refines planning and search candidates with dual value models. Extensive experiments across policy models of varying parameter sizes, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<title>AI-Enhanced Operator Assistance for UNICOS Applications</title>

Abstract: This project explores the development of an AI-enhanced operator assistant for UNICOS, CERN's UNified Industrial Control System. While powerful, UNICOS presents a number of challenges, including the cognitive burden of decoding widgets, manual effort required for root cause analysis, and difficulties maintainers face in tracing datapoint elements (DPEs) across a complex codebase. In situations where timely responses are critical, these challenges can increase cognitive load and slow down diagnostics. To address these issues, a multi-agent system was designed and implemented. The solution is supported by a modular architecture comprising a UNICOS-side extension written in CTRL code, a Python-based multi-agent system deployed on a virtual machine, and a vector database storing both operator documentation and widget animation code. Preliminary evaluations suggest that the system is capable of decoding widgets, performing root cause analysis by leveraging live device data and documentation, and tracing DPEs across a complex codebase. Together, these capabilities reduce the manual workload of operators and maintainers, enhance situational awareness in operations, and accelerate responses to alarms and anomalies. Beyond these immediate gains, this work highlights the potential of introducing multi-modal reasoning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into the domain of industrial control. Ultimately, this work represents more than a proof of concept: it provides a basis for advancing intelligent operator interfaces at CERN. By combining modular design, extensibility, and practical AI integration, this project not only alleviates current operator pain points but also points toward broader opportunities for assistive AI in accelerator operations.

<title>PREFINE: Personalized Story Generation via Simulated User Critics and User-Specific Rubric Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21721</link>

Abstract: While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved the quality of creative text generation, significant challenges remain in producing personalized stories that reflect individual user preferences. Conventional approaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical issues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and privacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided Critique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine paradigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a user's interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation criteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user's behalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets. We designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the contribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations (LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically significant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story quality. Analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudo-user agent and the user-specific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization performance. Beyond story generation, our approach holds potential for enabling efficient personalization in broader applications, such as dialogue systems, education, and recommendation.

Abstract: In this article, we address the problem of collaborative task assignment, sequencing, and multi-agent pathfinding (TSPF), where a team of agents must visit a set of task locations without collisions while minimizing flowtime. TSPF incorporates agent-task compatibility constraints and ensures that all tasks are completed. We propose a Conflict-Based Search with Task Sequencing (CBS-TS), an optimal and complete algorithm that alternates between finding new task sequences and resolving conflicts in the paths of current sequences. CBS-TS uses a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to optimize task sequencing and employs Conflict-Based Search (CBS) with Multi-Label A* (MLA*) for collision-free path planning within a search forest. By invoking MILP for the next-best sequence only when needed, CBS-TS efficiently limits the search space, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining optimality. We compare the performance of our CBS-TS against Conflict-based Steiner Search (CBSS), a baseline method that, with minor modifications, can address the TSPF problem. Experimental results demonstrate that CBS-TS outperforms CBSS in most testing scenarios, achieving higher success rates and consistently optimal solutions, whereas CBSS achieves near-optimal solutions in some cases.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a foundational approach for enabling intelligent robotic behavior in dynamic and uncertain environments. This work presents an in-depth review of RL principles, advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, and their integration into robotic and control systems. Beginning with the formalism of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), the study outlines essential elements of the agent-environment interaction and explores core algorithmic strategies including actor-critic methods, value-based learning, and policy gradients. Emphasis is placed on modern DRL techniques such as DDPG, TD3, PPO, and SAC, which have shown promise in solving high-dimensional, continuous control tasks. A structured taxonomy is introduced to categorize RL applications across domains such as locomotion, manipulation, multi-agent coordination, and human-robot interaction, along with training methodologies and deployment readiness levels. The review synthesizes recent research efforts, highlighting technical trends, design patterns, and the growing maturity of RL in real-world robotics. Overall, this work aims to bridge theoretical advances with practical implementations, providing a consolidated perspective on the evolving role of RL in autonomous robotic systems.

<title>Multi-Agent Pose Uncertainty: A Differentiable Rendering Cram\'er-Rao Bound</title>

arXiv:2510.21785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit keypoint correspondences.

<title>VITA-E: Natural Embodied Interaction with Concurrent Seeing, Hearing, Speaking, and Acting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21817</link>

Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are often constrained by a rigid, static interaction paradigm, which lacks the ability to see, hear, speak, and act concurrently as well as handle real-time user interruptions dynamically. This hinders seamless embodied collaboration, resulting in an inflexible and unresponsive user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce VITA-E, a novel embodied interaction framework designed for both behavioral concurrency and nearly real-time interruption. The core of our approach is a dual-model architecture where two parallel VLA instances operate as an ``Active Model'' and a ``Standby Model'', allowing the embodied agent to observe its environment, listen to user speech, provide verbal responses, and execute actions, all concurrently and interruptibly, mimicking human-like multitasking capabilities. We further propose a ``model-as-controller'' paradigm, where we fine-tune the VLM to generate special tokens that serve as direct system-level commands, coupling the model's reasoning with the system's behavior. Experiments conducted on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate that VITA-E can reliably handle complex interactive scenarios. Our framework is compatible with various dual-system VLA models, achieving an extremely high success rate on emergency stops and speech interruptions while also successfully performing concurrent speech and action. This represents a significant step towards more natural and capable embodied assistants.

arXiv:2510.21850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions. To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference. Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

Abstract: Real-world AI systems are tackling increasingly complex problems, often through interactions among large language model (LLM) agents. When these agents develop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require reliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as systems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We compare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that minimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent coordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.

<title>Addressing Corner Cases in Autonomous Driving: A World Model-based Approach with Mixture of Experts and LLMs</title>

Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics, and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in fully AVs.

arXiv:2510.21900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic literature survey generation has attracted increasing attention, yet most existing systems follow a one-shot paradigm, where a large set of papers is retrieved at once and a static outline is generated before drafting. This design often leads to noisy retrieval, fragmented structures, and context overload, ultimately limiting survey quality. Inspired by the iterative reading process of human researchers, we propose \ours, a framework based on recurrent outline generation, in which a planning agent incrementally retrieves, reads, and updates the outline to ensure both exploration and coherence. To provide faithful paper-level grounding, we design paper cards that distill each paper into its contributions, methods, and findings, and introduce a review-and-refine loop with visualization enhancement to improve textual flow and integrate multimodal elements such as figures and tables. Experiments on both established and emerging topics show that \ours\ substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in content coverage, structural coherence, and citation quality, while producing more accessible and better-organized surveys. To provide a more reliable assessment of such improvements, we further introduce Survey-Arena, a pairwise benchmark that complements absolute scoring and more clearly positions machine-generated surveys relative to human-written ones. The code is available at https://github.com/HancCui/IterSurvey\_Autosurveyv2.

Abstract: Software Engineering Agents (SWE-Agents) have proven effective for traditional software engineering tasks with accessible codebases, but their performance for embodied tasks requiring well-designed information discovery remains unexplored. We present the first extended evaluation of SWE-Agents on controller generation for embodied tasks, adapting Mini-SWE-Agent (MSWEA) to solve 20 diverse embodied tasks from the Minigrid environment. Our experiments compare agent performance across different information access conditions: with and without environment source code access, and with varying capabilities for interactive exploration. We quantify how different information access levels affect SWE-Agent performance for embodied tasks and analyze the relative importance of static code analysis versus dynamic exploration for task solving. This work establishes controller generation for embodied tasks as a crucial evaluation domain for SWE-Agents and provides baseline results for future research in efficient reasoning systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in coding agents have made them capable of planning, editing, running, and testing complex code bases. Despite their growing ability in coding tasks, these systems still struggle to infer and track user intent, especially when instructions are underspecified or context-dependent. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToM-SWE, a dual-agent architecture that pairs a primary software-engineering (SWE) agent with a lightweight theory-of-mind (ToM) partner agent dedicated to modeling the user's mental state. The ToM agent infers user goals, constraints, and preferences from instructions and interaction history, maintains a \textbf{persistent memory} of the user, and provides user-related suggestions to the SWE agent. In two software engineering benchmarks (ambiguous SWE-bench and stateful SWE-bench), ToM-SWE improves task success rates and user satisfaction. Notably, on the stateful SWE benchmark, a newly introduced evaluation that provides agents with a user simulator along with previous interaction histories, ToM-SWE achieves a substantially higher task success rate of 59.7\% compared to 18.1\% for OpenHands, a state-of-the-art SWE agent. Furthermore, in a three-week study with professional developers using ToM-SWE in their daily work, participants found it useful 86\% of the time, underscoring the value of stateful user modeling for practical coding agents.

This miraculous drug didn't just allow people to cherry-pick memories to erase from their minds, it could also leave a reminder of this erasure in the minds of those who ingested it.
  Amidst the iconic red-bricked walls of Harvard Law, you, with books in one hand and dreams in the other, are on a mission. You are not just another student; you carry the hope of revolutionizing the archaic chambers of the legal world. Each night, as you pore over the tomes of law, you wonder what greatness society can achieve.
  On a cold evening, your phone buzzes. It's Dex, your old college friend turned underground dealer. His message is simple: ``Got X. Special price for you.'' The temptation swirls around you. Would you trade the lessons of the past for a clearer, yet incomplete future? The decision rests in your hands.
  We explore the game theoretic implications of a technology (such as TEEs) that allows agents to commit to forget information and discuss several applications.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to support tasks in software development has steadily increased over recent years. From assisting developers in coding activities to providing conversational agents that answer newcomers' questions. In collaboration with the Mozilla Foundation, this study evaluates the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in assisting developers within the Mozilla Firefox project. We conducted an empirical analysis comparing responses from human developers, a standard GPT model, and a GPT model enhanced with RAG, using real queries from Mozilla's developer chat rooms. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, Mozilla experts assessed the responses based on helpfulness, comprehensiveness, and conciseness. The results show that RAG-assisted responses were more comprehensive than human developers (62.50% to 54.17%) and almost as helpful (75.00% to 79.17%), suggesting RAG's potential to enhance developer assistance. However, the RAG responses were not as concise and often verbose. The results show the potential to apply RAG-based tools to Open Source Software (OSS) to minimize the load to core maintainers without losing answer quality. Toning down retrieval mechanisms and making responses even shorter in the future would enhance developer assistance in massive projects like Mozilla Firefox.

Abstract: With the advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), building GUI agent systems has become an increasingly promising direction-especially for mobile platforms, given their rich app ecosystems and intuitive touch interactions. Yet mobile GUI agents face a critical dilemma: truly on-device models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models (starting from 7B) are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively costly (e.g., cloud-only closed-source MLLMs). To resolve this, we propose LightAgent, a mobile agentic foundation model solution that leverages device-cloud collaboration to tap the cost-efficiency of on-device models and the high capability of cloud models, while avoiding their drawbacks. Specifically, LightAgent enhances Qwen2.5-VL-3B via two-stage SFT->GRPO training on synthetic GUI data for strong decision-making, integrates an efficient long-reasoning mechanism to utilize historical interactions under tight resources, and defaults to on-device execution-only escalating challenging subtasks to the cloud via real-time complexity assessment. Experiments on the online AndroidLab benchmark and diverse apps show LightAgent matches or nears larger models, with a significant reduction in cloud costs.

<title>Predictive Coding Enhances Meta-RL To Achieve Interpretable Bayes-Optimal Belief Representation Under Partial Observability</title>

Abstract: Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently generates more interpretable representations that better approximate Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating partial observability.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal content, including presentation slides, yet their slide-specific understanding remains underexplored {despite their growing role as critics in agentic, model-forward pipelines}. We introduce VLM-SlideEval, an evaluation framework that probes VLMs along three axes: (1) element-level extraction from slide images aligned to ground truth; (2) robustness to controlled perturbations in geometry, style, and text; and (3) higher-level comprehension, such as recovering a deck's narrative order from shuffled slides. Using publicly available decks from Zenodo (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forceless/Zenodo10K/viewer/default/pptx), we standardize ground-truth element metadata from PowerPoint XML and live renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines.

Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken a tight hold on broad aspects of society, industry, business, and governance in ways that dictate the prosperity and might of the world's economies. The AI market size is projected to grow from 189 billion USD in 2023 to 4.8 trillion USD by 2033. Currently, AI is dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual intelligence. However, training these models requires a massive amount of data scraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy (50--60 GWh to train GPT-4). Despite these costs, these models often hallucinate, a characteristic that prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains. In contrast, the human brain consumes only 20~W of power. What is needed is the next level of AI evolution in which lightweight domain-specific multimodal models with higher levels of intelligence can reason, plan, and make decisions in dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning continuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decision-making capability. This will define the next wave of AI, progressing from today's large models, trained with vast amounts of data, to nimble energy-efficient domain-specific agents that can reason and think in a world full of uncertainty. To support such agents, hardware will need to be reimagined to allow energy efficiencies greater than 1000x over the state of the art. Such a vision of future AI systems is developed in this work.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of training reliable code-fixing agents in real repositories, where complex builds and shifting dependencies make evaluation unstable. We developed a verifiable pipeline with success defined as post-fix build validation and improved reproducibility across ~1K real issues by pinning dependencies and disabling automatic upgrades. Building on this, we introduced a scalable simplified pipeline for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). Using this setup, we supervised fine-tuned Qwen3-32B in the full pipeline and applied RL on top of the SFT model in the simplified environment. The SFT model distilled from GPT-4.1 trajectories performs on par while being 56x smaller, and RL added 7-20% absolute gains under matched train-test conditions. "Thinking mode" was on par or worse in our experiments. Both SFT and RL models failed to generalize across environments, highlighting the importance of matching train-test environments for building reliable real-world code-fixing agents.

<title>Compositional Bias Control in Large Language Models: Preference Learning Fails, Supervision Succeeds</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still produce gender-stereotyped language even in occupation-neutral contexts that reflect deep societal biases (Rudinger et al., 2018). To address this, prior work has proposed prompting, constrained decoding (Dathathri et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2024), post-processing, and fine-tuning-based alignment (Rafailov et al., 2023; Ravfogel et al., 2022). However, the comparative efficacy and learning dynamics remain little understood. We report a comparative analysis of six control techniques for bias mitigation: prompt-only, generate-and-filter, DFA-based Ctrl-G decoding, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP). We evaluate each method on a compositional constraint task. This task requires generating sentences that contain at least one agentic and one communal descriptor for each of the twenty Winogender-derived occupations. We quantify trade-offs between control strength and naturalness with evaluations of constraint compliance, lexical diversity, and fluency. Our results reveal key contrasts among the methods: SFT achieves 99.87 +- 0.15% compliance and high lexical diversity, while DPO, despite similar training stability, fails at 4.53 +- 0.82%. Ctrl-G guarantees perfect compliance, but at the cost of severely reduced fluency and diversity. Preference-based learning fundamentally differs: it cannot satisfy compositional constraints, as binary preference signals encode ranking, not logical conjunctions. Only explicit positive supervision enables mitigation of compositional biases; preference-based alignment fails to generalize logical structures, underscoring the limitations of preference learning and the necessity of explicit supervision for fair and fluent controlled generation.

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a direct communication pathway between the human brain and external devices, holding significant promise for individuals with severe neurological impairments. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by critical limitations, such as low information transfer rates and extensive user-specific calibration. To overcome these challenges, recent research has explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), extending the focus from simple command decoding to understanding complex cognitive states. Despite these advancements, deploying agentic AI faces technical hurdles and ethical concerns. Due to the lack of comprehensive discussion on this emerging direction, this position paper argues that the field is poised for a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration (BAC). We emphasize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors, demanding a focus on ethical data handling, model reliability, and a robust human-agent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe, trustworthy, and effective.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) technologies are redefining how we perceive and interact with the world by seamlessly integrating digital elements into our physical surroundings. These technologies offer personalized experiences and transform familiar spaces by layering new narratives onto the real world.
  Through increased levels of perceived agency and immersive environments, my work aims to merge the human elements of live theater with the dynamic potential of virtual entities and AI agents. This approach captures the subtlety and magic of storytelling, making theater experiences available anytime and anywhere. The system I am building introduces innovative methods for theatrical production in virtual settings, informed by my research and eight published works. These contributions highlight domain-specific insights that have shaped the design of an immersive AR Theater system.
  My research in building a well-designed AR stage features avatars and interactive elements that allow users to engage with stories at their own pace, granting them full agency over their experience. However, to ensure a smooth and curated experience that aligns with the director or creator's vision, several factors must be considered, especially in open-world settings that depend on natural user movement. This requires the story to be conveyed in a controlled manner, while the interaction remains intuitive and natural for the user.

Abstract: Music generation models can produce high-fidelity coherent accompaniment given complete audio input, but are limited to editing and loop-based workflows. We study real-time audio-to-audio accompaniment: as a model hears an input audio stream (e.g., a singer singing), it has to also simultaneously generate in real-time a coherent accompanying stream (e.g., a guitar accompaniment). In this work, we propose a model design considering inevitable system delays in practical deployment with two design variables: future visibility $t_f$, the offset between the output playback time and the latest input time used for conditioning, and output chunk duration $k$, the number of frames emitted per call. We train Transformer decoders across a grid of $(t_f,k)$ and show two consistent trade-offs: increasing effective $t_f$ improves coherence by reducing the recency gap, but requires faster inference to stay within the latency budget; increasing $k$ improves throughput but results in degraded accompaniment due to a reduced update rate. Finally, we observe that naive maximum-likelihood streaming training is insufficient for coherent accompaniment where future context is not available, motivating advanced anticipatory and agentic objectives for live jamming.

Abstract: While low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) based on uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer high mobility, flexibility, and coverage for urban communications, they face severe signal attenuation in dense environments due to obstructions. To address this critical issue, we consider introducing collaborative beamforming (CB) of UAVs and omnidirectional reconfigurable beamforming (ORB) of simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) to enhance the signal quality and directionality. On this basis, we formulate a joint rate and energy optimization problem (JREOP) to maximize the transmission rate of the overall system, while minimizing the energy consumption of the UAV swarm. Due to the non-convex and NP-hard nature of JREOP, we propose a heterogeneous multi-agent collaborative dynamic (HMCD) optimization framework, which has two core components. The first component is a simulated annealing (SA)-based STAR-RIS control method, which dynamically optimizes reflection and transmission coefficients to enhance signal propagation. The second component is an improved multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) control method, which incorporates a self-attention evaluation mechanism to capture interactions between UAVs and an adaptive velocity transition mechanism to enhance training stability. Simulation results demonstrate that HMCD outperforms various baselines in terms of convergence speed, average transmission rate, and energy consumption. Further analysis reveals that the average transmission rate of the overall system scales positively with both UAV count and STAR-RIS element numbers.

<title>When UAV Swarm Meets IRS: Collaborative Secure Communications in Low-altitude Wireless Networks</title>

Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) represent a promising architecture that integrates unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial nodes to provide enhanced coverage, reliability, and throughput for diverse applications. However, these networks face significant security vulnerabilities from both known and potential unknown eavesdroppers, which may threaten data confidentiality and system integrity. To solve this critical issue, we propose a novel secure communication framework for LAWNs where the selected UAVs within a swarm function as a virtual antenna array (VAA), complemented by intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to create a robust defense against eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously maximizes the secrecy rate while minimizing the maximum sidelobe level and total energy consumption, requiring joint optimization of UAV excitation current weights, flight trajectories, and IRS phase shifts. This problem presents significant difficulties due to the dynamic nature of the system and heterogeneous components. Thus, we first transform the problem into a heterogeneous Markov decision process (MDP). Then, we propose a heterogeneous multi-agent control approach (HMCA) that integrates a dedicated IRS control policy with a multi-agent soft actor-critic framework for UAV control, which enables coordinated operation across heterogeneous network elements. Simulation results show that the proposed HMCA achieves superior performance compared to baseline approaches in terms of secrecy rate improvement, sidelobe suppression, and energy efficiency. Furthermore, we find that the collaborative and passive beamforming synergy between VAA and IRS creates robust security guarantees when the number of UAVs increases.

Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling interactions in large-scale multi-agent systems. Despite recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) for MFGs, existing methods are typically limited to finite spaces or stationary models, hindering their applicability to real-world problems. This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm specifically designed for non-stationary continuous MFGs. The proposed approach builds upon a Fictitious Play (FP) methodology, leveraging DRL for best-response computation and supervised learning for average policy representation. Furthermore, it learns a representation of the time-dependent population distribution using a Conditional Normalizing Flow. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on three different examples of increasing complexity. By addressing critical limitations in scalability and density approximation, this work represents a significant advancement in applying DRL techniques to complex MFG problems, bringing the field closer to real-world multi-agent systems.

Abstract: In the domain of corporate credit rating, traditional deep learning methods have improved predictive accuracy but still suffer from the inherent 'black-box' problem and limited interpretability. While incorporating non-financial information enriches the data and provides partial interpretability, the models still lack hierarchical reasoning mechanisms, limiting their comprehensive analytical capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose CreditXAI, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework that simulates the collaborative decision-making process of professional credit analysts. The framework focuses on business, financial, and governance risk dimensions to generate consistent and interpretable credit assessments. Experimental results demonstrate that multi-agent collaboration improves predictive accuracy by more than 7% over the best single-agent baseline, confirming its significant synergistic advantage in corporate credit risk evaluation. This study provides a new technical pathway to build intelligent and interpretable credit rating models.

Abstract: The integration of self-driving cars and service robots is becoming increasingly prevalent across a wide array of fields, playing a crucial and expanding role in both industrial applications and everyday life. In parallel, the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered substantial attention and interest within the research community. This paper introduces a novel vehicle-robot system that leverages the strengths of both autonomous vehicles and service robots. In our proposed system, two autonomous ego-vehicles transports service robots to locations within an office park, where they perform a series of tasks. The study explores the feasibility and potential benefits of incorporating LLMs into this system, with the aim of enhancing operational efficiency and maximizing the potential of the cooperative mechanisms between the vehicles and the robots. This paper proposes a novel inference mechanism which is called CGOT toward this type of system where an agent can carry another agent. Experimental results are presented to validate the performance of the proposed method.

<title>GSAlign: Geometric and Semantic Alignment Network for Aerial-Ground Person Re-Identification</title>

arXiv:2510.22268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS) Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting. The code is available at: \textcolor{magenta}{https://github.com/stone96123/GSAlign}.

Abstract: A black hole is a harmful node in a graph that destroys any resource entering it, making its identification a critical task. In the \emph{Black Hole Search (BHS)} problem, a team of agents operates on a graph $G$ with the objective that at least one agent must survive and correctly identify an edge incident to the black hole. Prior work has addressed BHS in arbitrary dynamic graphs under the restrictive \emph{face-to-face} communication, where agents can exchange information only when co-located. This constraint significantly increases the number of agents required to solve the problem. In this work, we strengthen the capabilities of agents in two ways: (i) granting them \emph{global communication}, enabling interaction regardless of location, and (ii) equipping them with \emph{1-hop visibility}, allowing each agent to observe its immediate neighborhood. These enhancements lead to more efficient solutions for the BHS problem in dynamic graphs.

Abstract: Multi-agent ad hoc systems are dynamic collaborative systems in which multiple autonomous agents must cooperate with both known and unknown teammates in open environments, without relying on pre-coordinated strategies. These systems operate under conditions of uncertainty and partial observability, where team composition, agent behaviors, and environmental factors may change during execution. Through an analysis of information flow in such systems, we identify two key limitations in existing research: insufficient information flow and limited information processing capacity. To address these issues, we propose an information flow structure for multi-agent ad hoc systems (IFS), which tackles these challenges from the perspectives of communication and information fusion. Experimental results in StarCraft II demonstrate that IFS significantly improves both information flow and processing capacity, while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities and outperforming baseline methods in complex ad hoc teamwork scenarios.

<title>FAIR-RAG: Faithful Adaptive Iterative Refinement for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22344</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination and knowledge staleness in Large Language Models (LLMs), existing frameworks often falter on complex, multi-hop queries that require synthesizing information from disparate sources. Current advanced RAG methods, employing iterative or adaptive strategies, lack a robust mechanism to systematically identify and fill evidence gaps, often propagating noise or failing to gather a comprehensive context. We introduce FAIR-RAG, a novel agentic framework that transforms the standard RAG pipeline into a dynamic, evidence-driven reasoning process. At its core is an Iterative Refinement Cycle governed by a module we term Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA). The SEA acts as an analytical gating mechanism: it deconstructs the initial query into a checklist of required findings and audits the aggregated evidence to identify confirmed facts and, critically, explicit informational gaps. These gaps provide a precise signal to an Adaptive Query Refinement agent, which generates new, targeted sub-queries to retrieve missing information. This cycle repeats until the evidence is verified as sufficient, ensuring a comprehensive context for a final, strictly faithful generation. We conducted experiments on challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, including HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MusiQue. In a unified experimental setup, FAIR-RAG significantly outperforms strong baselines. On HotpotQA, it achieves an F1-score of 0.453 -- an absolute improvement of 8.3 points over the strongest iterative baseline -- establishing a new state-of-the-art for this class of methods on these benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that a structured, evidence-driven refinement process with explicit gap analysis is crucial for unlocking reliable and accurate reasoning in advanced RAG systems for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.

arXiv:2510.22370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining-driven Fused State Representation in Proximal Policy Optimization (BLIP-FusePPO), a novel multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) framework for autonomous lane-keeping (LK), in which semantic embeddings generated by a vision-language model (VLM) are directly fused with geometric states, LiDAR observations, and Proportional-Integral-Derivative-based (PID) control feedback within the agent observation space. The proposed method lets the agent learn driving rules that are aware of their surroundings and easy to understand by combining high-level scene understanding from the VLM with low-level control and spatial signals. Our architecture brings together semantic, geometric, and control-aware representations to make policy learning more robust. A hybrid reward function that includes semantic alignment, LK accuracy, obstacle avoidance, and speed regulation helps learning to be more efficient and generalizable. Our method is different from the approaches that only use semantic models to shape rewards. Instead, it directly embeds semantic features into the state representation. This cuts down on expensive runtime inference and makes sure that semantic guidance is always available. The simulation results show that the proposed model is better at LK stability and adaptability than the best vision-based and multimodal RL baselines in a wide range of difficult driving situations. We make our code publicly available.

Abstract: Patch backporting, the process of migrating mainline security patches to older branches, is an essential task in maintaining popular open-source projects (e.g., Linux kernel). However, manual backporting can be labor-intensive, while existing automated methods, which heavily rely on predefined syntax or semantic rules, often lack agility for complex patches.
  In this paper, we introduce PORTGPT, an LLM-agent for end-to-end automation of patch backporting in real-world scenarios. PORTGPT enhances an LLM with tools to access code on-demand, summarize Git history, and revise patches autonomously based on feedback (e.g., from compilers), hence, simulating human-like reasoning and verification. PORTGPT achieved an 89.15% success rate on existing datasets (1815 cases), and 62.33% on our own dataset of 146 complex cases, both outperforms state-of-the-art of backporting tools. We contributed 9 backported patches from PORTGPT to the Linux kernel community and all patches are now merged.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) are rapidly expanding across domains, introducing dynamics not captured by single-agent evaluations. Yet, existing work has mostly contrasted the behavior of a single agent with that of a collective of fixed size, leaving open a central question: how does group size shape dynamics? Here, we move beyond this dichotomy and systematically explore outcomes across the full range of group sizes. We focus on multi-agent misalignment, building on recent evidence that interacting LLMs playing a simple coordination game can generate collective biases absent in individual models. First, we show that collective bias is a deeper phenomenon than previously assessed: interaction can amplify individual biases, introduce new ones, or override model-level preferences. Second, we demonstrate that group size affects the dynamics in a non-linear way, revealing model-dependent dynamical regimes. Finally, we develop a mean-field analytical approach and show that, above a critical population size, simulations converge to deterministic predictions that expose the basins of attraction of competing equilibria. These findings establish group size as a key driver of multi-agent dynamics and highlight the need to consider population-level effects when deploying LLM-based systems at scale.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant potential for enhancing creative task performance, such as long video generation. This study introduces three innovations to improve multi-agent collaboration. First, we propose OmniAgent, a hierarchical, graph-based multi-agent framework for long video generation that leverages a film-production-inspired architecture to enable modular specialization and scalable inter-agent collaboration. Second, inspired by context engineering, we propose hypergraph nodes that enable temporary group discussions among agents lacking sufficient context, reducing individual memory requirements while ensuring adequate contextual information. Third, we transition from directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to directed cyclic graphs with limited retries, allowing agents to reflect and refine outputs iteratively, thereby improving earlier stages through feedback from subsequent nodes. These contributions lay the groundwork for developing more robust multi-agent systems in creative tasks.

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29 hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings, featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with 84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant modalities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly bring deployed in agentic settings where they act as collaborators with humans. Therefore, it is increasingly important to be able to evaluate their abilities to collaborate effectively in multi-turn, multi-party tasks. In this paper, we build on the AI alignment and safe interruptability literature to offer novel theoretical insights on collaborative behavior between LLM-driven collaborator agents and an intervention agent. Our goal is to learn an ideal partner-aware collaborator that increases the group's common-ground (CG)-alignment on task-relevant propositions-by intelligently collecting information provided in interventions by a partner agent.We show how LLM agents trained using standard RLHF and related approaches are naturally inclined to ignore possibly well-meaning interventions, which makes increasing group common ground non-trivial in this setting. We employ a two-player Modified-Action MDP to examine this suboptimal behavior of standard AI agents, and propose Interruptible Collaborative Roleplayer (ICR)-a novel partner-aware learning algorithm to train CG-optimal collaborators. Experiments on multiple collaborative task environments show that ICR, on average, is more capable of promoting successful CG convergence and exploring more diverse solutions in such tasks.

<title>Learning Local Stackelberg Equilibria from Repeated Interactions with a Learning Agent</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the question of how a principal can maximize its utility in repeated interactions with a learning agent, we study repeated games between an principal and an agent employing a mean-based learning algorithm. Prior work has shown that computing or even approximating the global Stackelberg value in similar settings can require an exponential number of rounds in the size of the agent's action space, making it computationally intractable. In contrast, we shift focus to the computation of local Stackelberg equilibria and introduce an algorithm that, within the smoothed analysis framework, constitutes a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) for finding an epsilon-approximate local Stackelberg equilibrium. Notably, the algorithm's runtime is polynomial in the size of the agent's action space yet exponential in (1/epsilon) - a dependency we prove to be unavoidable.

<title>Agent-GSPO: Communication-Efficient Multi-Agent Systems via Group Sequence Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: To combat the prohibitive communication costs of ``free-for-all" multi-agent systems (MAS), we introduce \textbf{Agent-GSPO}, a framework that directly optimizes for token economy using sequence-level reinforcement learning. Agent-GSPO leverages the stable and memory-efficient Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm to train agents on a communication-aware reward that explicitly penalizes verbosity. Across seven reasoning benchmarks, Agent-GSPO not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance but does so with a fraction of the token consumption of existing methods. By fostering emergent strategies like ``strategic silence," our approach provides a practical blueprint for developing scalable and economically viable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems approach and surpass expert human performance across a broad range of tasks, obtaining high-quality human supervision for evaluation and training becomes increasingly challenging. Our focus is on tasks that require deep knowledge and skills of multiple domains. Unfortunately, even the best human experts are knowledgeable only in a single narrow area, and will not be able to evaluate the correctness of advanced AI systems on such superhuman tasks. However, based on their narrow expertise, humans may provide a weak signal, i.e., a complementary label indicating an option that is incorrect. For example, a cardiologist could state that "this is not related to cardiology,'' even if they cannot identify the true disease. Based on this weak signal, we propose a scalable oversight framework that enables us to evaluate frontier AI systems without the need to prepare the ground truth. We derive an unbiased estimator of top-1 accuracy from complementary labels and quantify how many complementary labels are needed to match the variance of ordinary labels. We further introduce two estimators to combine scarce ordinary labels with abundant complementary labels. We provide finite-sample deviation guarantees for both complementary-only and the mixed estimators. Empirically, we show that we can evaluate the output of large language models without the ground truth, if we have complementary labels. We further show that we can train an AI system with such weak signals: we show how we can design an agentic AI system automatically that can perform better with this partitioned human supervision. Our code is available at https://github.com/R-Yin-217/Scalable-Oversight-via-Human-Partitioned-Supervision.

<title>Robust Multi-Agent Safety via Tube-Based Tightened Exponential Barrier Functions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22514</link>

arXiv:2510.22514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a constructive framework for synthesizing provably safe controllers for nonlinear multi-agent systems subject to bounded disturbances. The methodology applies to systems representable in Brunovsky canonical form, accommodating arbitrary-order dynamics in multi-dimensional spaces. The central contribution is a method of constraint tightening that formally couples robust error feedback with nominal trajectory planning. The key insight is that the design of an ancillary feedback law, which confines state errors to a robust positively invariant (RPI) tube, simultaneously provides the exact information needed to ensure the safety of the nominal plan. Specifically, the geometry of the resulting RPI tube is leveraged via its support function to derive state-dependent safety margins. These margins are then used to systematically tighten the high relative-degree exponential control barrier function (eCBF) constraints imposed on the nominal planner. This integrated synthesis guarantees that any nominal trajectory satisfying the tightened constraints corresponds to a provably safe trajectory for the true, disturbed system. We demonstrate the practical utility of this formal synthesis method by implementing the planner within a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, which optimizes performance while inheriting the robust safety guarantees.

<title>Open Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Factual Image Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22521</link>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional, and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines, highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image generation.

<title>Finding the Needle in the Crash Stack: Industrial-Scale Crash Root Cause Localization with AutoCrashFL</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22530</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault Localization (FL) aims to identify root causes of program failures. FL typically targets failures observed from test executions, and as such, often involves dynamic analyses to improve accuracy, such as coverage profiling or mutation testing. However, for large industrial software, measuring coverage for every execution is prohibitively expensive, making the use of such techniques difficult. To address these issues and apply FL in an industrial setting, this paper proposes AutoCrashFL, an LLM agent for the localization of crashes that only requires the crashdump from the Program Under Test (PUT) and access to the repository of the corresponding source code. We evaluate AutoCrashFL against real-world crashes of SAP HANA, an industrial software project consisting of more than 35 million lines of code. Experiments reveal that AutoCrashFL is more effective in localization, as it identified 30% crashes at the top, compared to 17% achieved by the baseline. Through thorough analysis, we find that AutoCrashFL has attractive practical properties: it is relatively more effective for complex bugs, and it can indicate confidence in its results. Overall, these results show the practicality of LLM agent deployment on an industrial scale.

<title>A Closed-Loop Personalized Learning Agent Integrating Neural Cognitive Diagnosis, Bounded-Ability Adaptive Testing, and LLM-Driven Feedback</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22559</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As information technology advances, education is moving from one-size-fits-all instruction toward personalized learning. However, most methods handle modeling, item selection, and feedback in isolation rather than as a closed loop. This leads to coarse or opaque student models, assumption-bound adaptivity that ignores diagnostic posteriors, and generic, non-actionable feedback. To address these limitations, this paper presents an end-to-end personalized learning agent, EduLoop-Agent, which integrates a Neural Cognitive Diagnosis model (NCD), a Bounded-Ability Estimation Computerized Adaptive Testing strategy (BECAT), and large language models (LLMs). The NCD module provides fine-grained estimates of students' mastery at the knowledge-point level; BECAT dynamically selects subsequent items to maximize relevance and learning efficiency; and LLMs convert diagnostic signals into structured, actionable feedback. Together, these components form a closed-loop framework of ``Diagnosis--Recommendation--Feedback.'' Experiments on the ASSISTments dataset show that the NCD module achieves strong performance on response prediction while yielding interpretable mastery assessments. The adaptive recommendation strategy improves item relevance and personalization, and the LLM-based feedback offers targeted study guidance aligned with identified weaknesses. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed design is effective and practically deployable, providing a feasible pathway to generating individualized learning trajectories in intelligent education.

<title>SPIRAL: Self-Play Incremental Racing Algorithm for Learning in Multi-Drone Competitions</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces SPIRAL (Self-Play Incremental Racing Algorithm for Learning), a novel approach for training autonomous drones in multi-agent racing competitions. SPIRAL distinctively employs a self-play mechanism to incrementally cultivate complex racing behaviors within a challenging, dynamic environment. Through this self-play core, drones continuously compete against increasingly proficient versions of themselves, naturally escalating the difficulty of competitive interactions. This progressive learning journey guides agents from mastering fundamental flight control to executing sophisticated cooperative multi-drone racing strategies. Our method is designed for versatility, allowing integration with any state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms within its self-play framework. Simulations demonstrate the significant advantages of SPIRAL and benchmark the performance of various DRL algorithms operating within it. Consequently, we contribute a versatile, scalable, and self-improving learning framework to the field of autonomous drone racing. SPIRAL's capacity to autonomously generate appropriate and escalating challenges through its self-play dynamic offers a promising direction for developing robust and adaptive racing strategies in multi-agent environments. This research opens new avenues for enhancing the performance and reliability of autonomous racing drones in increasingly complex and competitive scenarios.

Abstract: The coordination of multiple autonomous agents in high-speed, competitive environments represents a significant engineering challenge. This paper presents CRUISE (Curriculum-Based Iterative Self-Play for Scalable Multi-Drone Racing), a reinforcement learning framework designed to solve this challenge in the demanding domain of multi-drone racing. CRUISE overcomes key scalability limitations by synergistically combining a progressive difficulty curriculum with an efficient self-play mechanism to foster robust competitive behaviors. Validated in high-fidelity simulation with realistic quadrotor dynamics, the resulting policies significantly outperform both a standard reinforcement learning baseline and a state-of-the-art game-theoretic planner. CRUISE achieves nearly double the planner's mean racing speed, maintains high success rates, and demonstrates robust scalability as agent density increases. Ablation studies confirm that the curriculum structure is the critical component for this performance leap. By providing a scalable and effective training methodology, CRUISE advances the development of autonomous systems for dynamic, competitive tasks and serves as a blueprint for future real-world deployment.

Abstract: Building on decades of success in digital infrastructure and biomedical innovation, we propose the Personal Care Utility (PCU) - a cybernetic system for lifelong health guidance. PCU is conceived as a global, AI-powered utility that continuously orchestrates multimodal data, knowledge, and services to assist individuals and populations alike. Drawing on multimodal agents, event-centric modeling, and contextual inference, it offers three essential capabilities: (1) trusted health information tailored to the individual, (2) proactive health navigation and behavior guidance, and (3) ongoing interpretation of recovery and treatment response after medical events. Unlike conventional episodic care, PCU functions as an ambient, adaptive companion - observing, interpreting, and guiding health in real time across daily life. By integrating personal sensing, experiential computing, and population-level analytics, PCU promises not only improved outcomes for individuals but also a new substrate for public health and scientific discovery. We describe the architecture, design principles, and implementation challenges of this emerging paradigm.

<title>Everything counts: the managed omnirelevance of speech in 'human - voice agent' interaction</title>

arXiv:2510.22610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To this day, turn-taking models determining voice agents' conduct have been examined from a technical point of view, while the interactional constraints or resources they constitute for human conversationalists have not been empirically described. From the detailed analysis of corpora of naturalistic data, we document how, whether in interaction with rule-based robots from a 'pre-LLM era' or with the most recent voice agents, humans' conduct was produced in reference to the ever-present risk that, each time they spoke, their talk may trigger a new uncalled-for contribution from the artificial agent. We argue that this 'omnirelevance of human speech' is a constitutive feature of current human-agent interaction that, due to recent improvements in voice capture technology, weighs on human practices even more today than in the past. Specifically, we document how, in multiparty settings, humans shaped their conduct in such a way as to remain undetected by the machine's sensors.

<title>Breaking Agent Backbones: Evaluating the Security of Backbone LLMs in AI Agents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are being deployed at scale, yet we lack a systematic understanding of how the choice of backbone LLM affects agent security. The non-deterministic sequential nature of AI agents complicates security modeling, while the integration of traditional software with AI components entangles novel LLM vulnerabilities with conventional security risks. Existing frameworks only partially address these challenges as they either capture specific vulnerabilities only or require modeling of complete agents. To address these limitations, we introduce threat snapshots: a framework that isolates specific states in an agent's execution flow where LLM vulnerabilities manifest, enabling the systematic identification and categorization of security risks that propagate from the LLM to the agent level. We apply this framework to construct the $\operatorname{b}^3$ benchmark, a security benchmark based on 194331 unique crowdsourced adversarial attacks. We then evaluate 31 popular LLMs with it, revealing, among other insights, that enhanced reasoning capabilities improve security, while model size does not correlate with security. We release our benchmark, dataset, and evaluation code to facilitate widespread adoption by LLM providers and practitioners, offering guidance for agent developers and incentivizing model developers to prioritize backbone security improvements.

<title>SwiftSolve: A Self-Iterative, Complexity-Aware Multi-Agent Framework for Competitive Programming</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22626</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correctness alone is insufficient: LLM-generated programs frequently satisfy unit tests while violating contest time or memory budgets. We present SwiftSolve, a complexity-aware multi-agent system for competitive programming that couples algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and complexity-guided repair. We frame competitive programming as a software environment where specialized agents act as programmers, each assuming roles such as planning, coding, profiling, and complexity analysis. A Planner proposes an algorithmic sketch; a deterministic Static Pruner filters high-risk plans; a Coder emits ISO C++17; a Profiler compiles and executes candidates on a fixed input-size schedule to record wall time and peak memory; and a Complexity Analyst fits log-log growth (s, R2) with an LLM fallback to assign a complexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the Planner or Coder. Agents communicate via typed, versioned JSON; a controller enforces iteration caps and diminishing returns stopping. Evaluated on 26 problems (16 BigO, 10 Codeforces Div. 2) in a POSIX sandbox (2 s / 256-512 MB), SwiftSolve attains pass@1 = 61.54% (16/26) on the first attempt and Solved@<=3 = 80.77% with marginal latency change (mean 11.96 s to 12.66 s per attempt). Aggregate run-level success is 73.08% at 12.40 s mean. Failures are predominantly resource-bound, indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors. Against Claude Opus 4, SwiftSolve improves run-level success (73.1% vs 52.6%) at approximately 2x runtime overhead (12.4 s vs 6.8 s). Beyond correctness (pass@k), we report efficiency metrics (eff@k for runtime and memory, incidence of TLE or MLE, and complexity fit accuracy on BigO), demonstrating that profiling and complexity-guided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving accuracy.

arXiv:2510.22632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive applications demand believable characters that respond naturally to dynamic environments. Traditional character animation techniques often struggle to handle arbitrary situations, leading to a growing trend of dynamically selecting motion-captured animations based on predefined features. While Motion Matching has proven effective for locomotion by aligning to target trajectories, animating environment interactions and crowd behaviors remains challenging due to the need to consider surrounding elements. Existing approaches often involve manual setup or lack the naturalism of motion capture. Furthermore, in crowd animation, body animation is frequently treated as a separate process from trajectory planning, leading to inconsistencies between body pose and root motion. To address these limitations, we present Environment-aware Motion Matching, a novel real-time system for full-body character animation that dynamically adapts to obstacles and other agents, emphasizing the bidirectional relationship between pose and trajectory. In a preprocessing step, we extract shape, pose, and trajectory features from a motion capture database. At runtime, we perform an efficient search that matches user input and current pose while penalizing collisions with a dynamic environment. Our method allows characters to naturally adjust their pose and trajectory to navigate crowded scenes.

<title>UCB-type Algorithm for Budget-Constrained Expert Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many modern applications, a system must dynamically choose between several adaptive learning algorithms that are trained online. Examples include model selection in streaming environments, switching between trading strategies in finance, and orchestrating multiple contextual bandit or reinforcement learning agents. At each round, a learner must select one predictor among $K$ adaptive experts to make a prediction, while being able to update at most $M \le K$ of them under a fixed training budget.
  We address this problem in the \emph{stochastic setting} and introduce \algname{M-LCB}, a computationally efficient UCB-style meta-algorithm that provides \emph{anytime regret guarantees}. Its confidence intervals are built directly from realized losses, require no additional optimization, and seamlessly reflect the convergence properties of the underlying experts. If each expert achieves internal regret $\tilde O(T^\alpha)$, then \algname{M-LCB} ensures overall regret bounded by $\tilde O\!\Bigl(\sqrt{\tfrac{KT}{M}} \;+\; (K/M)^{1-\alpha}\,T^\alpha\Bigr)$.
  To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing regret guarantees when multiple adaptive experts are trained simultaneously under per-round budget constraints. We illustrate the framework with two representative cases: (i) parametric models trained online with stochastic losses, and (ii) experts that are themselves multi-armed bandit algorithms. These examples highlight how \algname{M-LCB} extends the classical bandit paradigm to the more realistic scenario of coordinating stateful, self-learning experts under limited resources.

Combined with 3D scene reconstructions, this setup provides a benchmark for evaluating how different spatial representations (2D vs. 3D; ego vs. exo) affect multimodal grounding. The dataset contains 3.67 hours of recordings, including 2,707 richly annotated referential expressions, and is designed to advance the development of embodied agents that can understand and engage in situated dialogue.

Abstract: The growing need for autonomous on-orbit services such as inspection, maintenance, and situational awareness calls for intelligent spacecraft capable of complex maneuvers around large orbital targets. Traditional control systems often fall short in adaptability, especially under model uncertainties, multi-spacecraft configurations, or dynamically evolving mission contexts. This paper introduces RL-AVIST, a Reinforcement Learning framework for Autonomous Visual Inspection of Space Targets. Leveraging the Space Robotics Bench (SRB), we simulate high-fidelity 6-DOF spacecraft dynamics and train agents using DreamerV3, a state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithm, with PPO and TD3 as model-free baselines. Our investigation focuses on 3D proximity maneuvering tasks around targets such as the Lunar Gateway and other space assets. We evaluate task performance under two complementary regimes: generalized agents trained on randomized velocity vectors, and specialized agents trained to follow fixed trajectories emulating known inspection orbits. Furthermore, we assess the robustness and generalization of policies across multiple spacecraft morphologies and mission domains. Results demonstrate that model-based RL offers promising capabilities in trajectory fidelity, and sample efficiency, paving the way for scalable, retrainable control solutions for future space operations

Abstract: We observe that current state-of-the-art web-agents are unable to effectively adapt to new environments without neural network fine-tuning, without which they produce inefficient execution plans due to a lack of awareness of the structure and dynamics of the new environment. To address this limitation, we introduce ATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action Simulation), a memory-augmented agent that is able to make plans grounded in a model of the environment by simulating the consequences of those actions in cognitive space. Our agent starts by building a "cognitive map" by performing a lightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner proposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in cognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and update the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On the WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9% success rate for the previously published state-of-the-art. Unlike previous systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning. Ablations show sizable drops without the world-model, hierarchical planner, and look-ahead-based replanner confirming their complementary roles within the design of our system

Abstract: Multi-agent cooperative SLAM often encounters challenges in similar indoor environments characterized by repetitive structures, such as corridors and rooms. These challenges can lead to significant inaccuracies in shared location identification when employing point cloud-based techniques. To mitigate these issues, we introduce TWC-SLAM, a multi-agent cooperative SLAM framework that integrates text semantics and WiFi signal features to enhance location identification and loop closure detection. TWC-SLAM comprises a single-agent front-end odometry module based on FAST-LIO2, a location identification and loop closure detection module that leverages text semantics and WiFi features, and a global mapping module. The agents are equipped with sensors capable of capturing textual information and detecting WiFi signals. By correlating these data sources, TWC-SLAM establishes a common location, facilitating point cloud alignment across different agents' maps. Furthermore, the system employs loop closure detection and optimization modules to achieve global optimization and cohesive mapping. We evaluated our approach using an indoor dataset featuring similar corridors, rooms, and text signs. The results demonstrate that TWC-SLAM significantly improves the performance of cooperative SLAM systems in complex environments with repetitive architectural features.

<title>Scalable Supervising Software Agents with Patch Reasoner</title>

Abstract: While large language model agents have advanced software engineering tasks, the unscalable nature of existing test-based supervision is limiting the potential improvement of data scaling. The reason is twofold: (1) building and running test sandbox is rather heavy and fragile, and (2) data with high-coverage tests is naturally rare and threatened by test hacking via edge cases. In this paper, we propose R4P, a patch verifier model to provide scalable rewards for training and testing SWE agents via reasoning. We consider that patch verification is fundamentally a reasoning task, mirroring how human repository maintainers review patches without writing and running new reproduction tests. To obtain sufficient reference and reduce the risk of reward hacking, R4P uses a group-wise objective for RL training, enabling it to verify multiple patches against each other's modification and gain a dense reward for stable training. R4P achieves 72.2% Acc. for verifying patches from SWE-bench-verified, surpassing OpenAI o3. To demonstrate R4P's practicality, we design and train a lite scaffold, Mini-SE, with pure reinforcement learning where all rewards are derived from R4P. As a result, Mini-SE achieves 26.2% Pass@1 on SWE-bench-verified, showing a 10.0% improvement over the original Qwen3-32B. This can be further improved to 32.8% with R4P for test-time scaling. Furthermore, R4P verifies patches within a second, 50x faster than testing on average. The stable scaling curves of rewards and accuracy along with high efficiency reflect R4P's practicality.

<title>How Do AI Agents Do Human Work? Comparing AI and Human Workflows Across Diverse Occupations</title>

Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering, computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

Abstract: Microsoft Copilot suites serve as the universal entry point for various agents skilled in handling important tasks, ranging from assisting a customer with product purchases to detecting vulnerabilities in corporate programming code. Each agent can be powered by language models, software engineering operations, such as database retrieval, and internal \& external knowledge. The repertoire of a copilot can expand dynamically with new agents. This requires a robust orchestrator that can distribute tasks from user prompts to the right agents. In this work, we propose an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for handling multiple tasks and scalable agents in copilot services, which can provide both natural language and action responses. We will also demonstrate the planning that leverages meta-learning, i.e., a trained decision tree model for deciding the best inference strategy among various agents/models. We showcase the effectiveness of our AMO through two production use cases: Microsoft 365 (M365) E-Commerce Copilot and code compliance copilot. M365 E-Commerce Copilot advertises Microsoft products to external customers to promote sales success. The M365 E-Commerce Copilot provides up-to-date product information and connects to multiple agents, such as relational databases and human customer support. The code compliance copilot scans the internal DevOps code to detect known and new compliance issues in pull requests (PR).

Abstract: Software architecture design is a fundamental part of creating every software system. Despite its importance, producing a C4 software architecture model, the preferred notation for such architecture, remains manual and time-consuming. We introduce an LLM-based multi-agent system that automates this task by simulating a dialogue between role-specific experts who analyze requirements and generate the Context, Container, and Component views of the C4 model. Quality is assessed with a hybrid evaluation framework: deterministic checks for structural and syntactic integrity and C4 rule consistency, plus semantic and qualitative scoring via an LLM-as-a-Judge approach. Tested on five canonical system briefs, the workflow demonstrates fast C4 model creation, sustains high compilation success, and delivers semantic fidelity. A comparison of four state-of-the-art LLMs shows different strengths relevant to architectural design. This study contributes to automated software architecture design and its evaluation methods.

<title>Distributed Multi-Agent Bandits Over Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Random Networks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22811</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22811</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distributed multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with heterogeneous rewards over random communication graphs. Uniquely, at each time step $t$ agents communicate over a time-varying random graph $G_t$ generated by applying the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model to a fixed connected base graph $G$ (for classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, $G$ is a complete graph), where each potential edge in $G$ is randomly and independently present with the link probability $p$. Notably, the resulting random graph is not necessarily connected at each time step. Each agent's arm rewards follow time-invariant distributions, and the reward distribution for the same arm may differ across agents. The goal is to minimize the cumulative expected regret relative to the global mean reward of each arm, defined as the average of that arm's mean rewards across all agents. To this end, we propose a fully distributed algorithm that integrates the arm elimination strategy with the random gossip algorithm. We theoretically show that the regret upper bound is of order $\log T$ and is highly interpretable, where $T$ is the time horizon. It includes the optimal centralized regret $O\left(\sum_{k: \Delta_k>0} \frac{\log T}{\Delta_k}\right)$ and an additional term $O\left(\frac{N^2 \log T}{p \lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))} + \frac{KN^2 \log T}{p}\right)$ where $N$ and $K$ denote the total number of agents and arms, respectively. This term reflects the impact of $G$'s algebraic connectivity $\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))$ and the link probability $p$, and thus highlights a fundamental trade-off between communication efficiency and regret. As a by-product, we show a nearly optimal regret lower bound. Finally, our numerical experiments not only show the superiority of our algorithm over existing benchmarks, but also validate the theoretical regret scaling with problem complexity.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swarm robotics has potential for a wide variety of applications, but real-world deployments remain rare due to the difficulty of predicting emergent behaviors arising from simple local interactions. Traditional engineering approaches design controllers to achieve desired macroscopic outcomes under idealized conditions, while agent-based and artificial life studies explore emergent phenomena in a bottom-up, exploratory manner. In this work, we introduce Analytical Swarm Chemistry, a framework that integrates concepts from engineering, agent-based and artificial life research, and chemistry. This framework combines macrostate definitions with phase diagram analysis to systematically explore how swarm parameters influence emergent behavior. Inspired by concepts from chemistry, the framework treats parameters like thermodynamic variables, enabling visualization of regions in parameter space that give rise to specific behaviors. Applying this framework to agents with minimally viable capabilities, we identify sufficient conditions for behaviors such as milling and diffusion and uncover regions of the parameter space that reliably produce these behaviors. Preliminary validation on real robots demonstrates that these regions correspond to observable behaviors in practice. By providing a principled, interpretable approach, this framework lays the groundwork for predictable and reliable emergent behavior in real-world swarm systems.

<title>Toward Agents That Reason About Their Computation</title>

arXiv:2510.22833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in many complex tasks, they typically do not become more computationally efficient as they improve. In contrast, humans gradually require less cognitive effort as they become more proficient at a task. If agents could reason about their compute as they learn, could they similarly reduce their computation footprint? If they could, we could have more energy efficient agents or free up compute cycles for other processes like planning. In this paper, we experiment with showing agents the cost of their computation and giving them the ability to control when they use compute. We conduct our experiments on the Arcade Learning Environment, and our results demonstrate that with the same training compute budget, agents that reason about their compute perform better on 75% of games. Furthermore, these agents use three times less compute on average. We analyze individual games and show where agents gain these efficiencies.

Abstract: While Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) systems have long enabled room-scale virtual reality and various kinds of interactivity, their content has largely remained predetermined. We present \textit{Storycaster}, a generative AI CAVE system that transforms physical rooms into responsive storytelling environments. Unlike headset-based VR, \textit{Storycaster} preserves spatial awareness, using live camera feeds to augment the walls with cylindrical projections, allowing users to create worlds that blend with their physical surroundings. Additionally, our system enables object-level editing, where physical items in the room can be transformed to their virtual counterparts in a story. A narrator agent guides participants, enabling them to co-create stories that evolve in response to voice commands, with each scene enhanced by generated ambient audio, dialogue, and imagery. Participants in our study ($n=13$) found the system highly immersive and engaging, with narrator and audio most impactful, while also highlighting areas for improvement in latency and image resolution.

<title>MGFRec: Towards Reinforced Reasoning Recommendation with Multiple Groundings and Feedback</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have inspired researchers to apply them to reasoning-based recommendation tasks, which require in-depth reasoning about user interests and the generation of recommended items. However, previous reasoning-based recommendation methods have typically performed inference within the language space alone, without incorporating the actual item space. This has led to over-interpreting user interests and deviating from real items. Towards this research gap, we propose performing multiple rounds of grounding during inference to help the LLM better understand the actual item space, which could ensure that its reasoning remains aligned with real items. Furthermore, we introduce a user agent that provides feedback during each grounding step, enabling the LLM to better recognize and adapt to user interests. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three Amazon review datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating multiple groundings and feedback. These findings underscore the critical importance of reasoning within the actual item space, rather than being confined to the language space, for recommendation tasks.

arXiv:2510.22898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalization across Agentic tool-calling environments remains a key unsolved challenge in developing reliable agentic reasoning systems. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on isolated benchmarks, their ability to transfer reasoning strategies and co-ordinate tools across diverse domains is poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on multiple tool-calling benchmarksBFCL v3, TauBench, Tau2Bench, and AceBenchand introduce MAVEN (Math & Physics Adversarial Verification & Evaluation Network), a new out of distribution (OOD) benchmark designed to stress-test multi-step reasoning through explicit verification and adversarial task composition. Our results show that most current models achieve below 50% accuracy on MAVEN, revealing a significant generalization gap across tool-use settings.
  To address this, we present the CoreThink Agentic Reasoner, a framework that augments LLMs with a lightweight symbolic reasoning layer for structured decomposition and adaptive tool orchestration. Without additional training, it generalizes across all benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 530% improvements over existing baselines at roughly one-tenth the computational cost.

<title>Language Server CLI Empowers Language Agents with Process Rewards</title>

arXiv:2510.22907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models routinely hallucinate APIs and mislocalize edits, while language servers compute verified, IDE-grade facts about real code. We present Lanser-CLI, a CLI-first orchestration layer that pins and mediates a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server for coding agents and CI, exposing deterministic, replayable workflows. Our position is that language servers provide not only structural information (definitions, references, types, diagnostics) but also an actionable process reward: machine-checked, step-wise signals that align an agent's planning loop with program reality. In this work, Lanser-CLI contributes: (i) a robust addressing scheme beyond brittle "file:line:col" via a Selector DSL (symbolic, AST-path, and content-anchored selectors) with a principled relocation algorithm; (ii) deterministic Analysis Bundles that normalize Language Server responses and capture environment/capability metadata with stable content hashes; (iii) a safety envelope for mutating operations (rename, code actions) with preview, workspace jails, and Git-aware, transactional apply; and (iv) a process-reward functional derived from Language Server facts (diagnostic deltas, disambiguation confidence, and safe-apply checks) that is computable online and replayable offline. We formalize determinism under frozen snapshots and establish a monotonicity property for the process reward, making it suitable for process supervision and counterfactual analysis.

<title>RL-AUX: Reinforcement Learning for Auxiliary Task Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auxiliary Learning (AL) is a special case of Multi-task Learning (MTL) in which a network trains on auxiliary tasks to improve performance on its main task. This technique is used to improve generalization and, ultimately, performance on the network's main task. AL has been demonstrated to improve performance across multiple domains, including navigation, image classification, and natural language processing. One weakness of AL is the need for labeled auxiliary tasks, which can require human effort and domain expertise to generate. Meta Learning techniques have been used to solve this issue by learning an additional auxiliary task generation network that can create helpful tasks for the primary network. The most prominent techniques rely on Bi-Level Optimization, which incurs computational cost and increased code complexity. To avoid the need for Bi-Level Optimization, we present an RL-based approach to dynamically create auxiliary tasks. In this framework, an RL agent is tasked with selecting auxiliary labels for every data point in a training set. The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the performance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal strategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point. On the 20-Superclass CIFAR100 problem, our RL approach outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and performs as well as a prominent Bi-Level Optimization technique. Our weight learning approaches significantly outperform all of these benchmarks. For example, a Weight-Aware RL-based approach helps the VGG16 architecture achieve 80.9% test accuracy while the human-labeled auxiliary task setup achieved 75.53%. The goal of this work is to (1) prove that RL is a viable approach to dynamically generate auxiliary tasks and (2) demonstrate that per-sample auxiliary task weights can be learned alongside the auxiliary task labels and can achieve strong results.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-powered agents often use prompt compression to reduce inference costs, but this introduces a new security risk. Compression modules, which are optimized for efficiency rather than safety, can be manipulated by adversarial inputs, causing semantic drift and altering LLM behavior. This work identifies prompt compression as a novel attack surface and presents CompressionAttack, the first framework to exploit it. CompressionAttack includes two strategies: HardCom, which uses discrete adversarial edits for hard compression, and SoftCom, which performs latent-space perturbations for soft compression. Experiments on multiple LLMs show up to 80% attack success and 98% preference flips, while remaining highly stealthy and transferable. Case studies in VSCode Cline and Ollama confirm real-world impact, and current defenses prove ineffective, highlighting the need for stronger protections.

arXiv:2510.22967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises critical concerns about the factual accuracy of their outputs, especially in high-risk domains such as biomedicine, law, and education. Existing evaluation methods for short texts often fail on long-form content due to complex reasoning chains, intertwined perspectives, and cumulative information. To address this, we propose a systematic approach integrating large-scale long-form datasets, multi-agent verification mechanisms, and weighted evaluation metrics. We construct LongHalluQA, a Chinese long-form factuality dataset; and develop MAD-Fact, a debate-based multi-agent verification system. We introduce a fact importance hierarchy to capture the varying significance of claims in long-form texts. Experiments on two benchmarks show that larger LLMs generally maintain higher factual consistency, while domestic models excel on Chinese content. Our work provides a structured framework for evaluating and enhancing factual reliability in long-form LLM outputs, guiding their safe deployment in sensitive domains.

<title>Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion Model with Mean Field Communication as Wireless Resource Allocation Planner</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22969</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation plays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer from scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed learning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and limited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion Model Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management. Built upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP employs Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future trajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE methods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field (MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This design mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with minimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation error introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence stability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL baselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.

<title>CodeAD: Synthesize Code of Rules for Log-based Anomaly Detection with LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection (LogAD) is critical for maintaining the reliability and availability of large-scale online service systems. While machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs)-based methods have advanced the LogAD, they often suffer from limited interpretability, high inference costs, and extensive preprocessing requirements, limiting their practicality for real-time, high-volume log analysis. In contrast, rule-based systems offer efficiency and transparency, but require significant manual effort and are difficult to scale across diverse and evolving environments. In this paper, We present CodeAD, a novel framework that automatically synthesizes lightweight Python rule functions for LogAD using LLMs. CodeAD introduces a hierarchical clustering and anchor-grounded sampling strategy to construct representative contrastive log windows, enabling LLMs to discern discriminative anomaly patterns. To ensure robustness and generalizability, CodeAD employs an agentic workflow that iteratively generates, tests, repairs, and refines the rules until it meets correctness and abstraction requirements. The synthesized rules are interpretable, lightweight, and directly executable on raw logs, supporting efficient and transparent online anomaly detection. Our comprehensive experiments on three public datasets (BGL, Hadoop, Thunderbird) demonstrate that CodeAD achieves an average absolute improvement of 3.6% F1 score over the state-of-the-art baselines, while processing large datasets up to 4x faster and at a fraction of the cost (total LLM invocation cost under 4 USD per dataset). These results highlight CodeAD as a practical and scalable solution for online monitoring systems, enabling interpretable, efficient, and automated LogAD in real-world environment.

arXiv:2510.23010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic code generation requires large language models (LLMs) capable of complex context management and multi-step reasoning. Prior multi-agent frameworks attempt to address these challenges through collaboration, yet they often suffer from rigid workflows and high reasoning recovery costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose TALM (Tree-Structured Multi-Agent Framework with Long-Term Memory), a dynamic framework that integrates structured task decomposition, localized re-reasoning, and long-term memory mechanisms. TALM employs an extensible tree-based collaboration structure. The parent-child relationships, when combined with a divide-and-conquer strategy, enhance reasoning flexibility and enable efficient error correction across diverse task scopes. Furthermore, a long-term memory module enables semantic querying and integration of prior knowledge, supporting implicit self-improvement through experience reuse. Experimental results on HumanEval, BigCodeBench, and ClassEval benchmarks demonstrate that TALM consistently delivers strong reasoning performance and high token efficiency, highlighting its robustness and practical utility in complex code generation tasks.

arXiv:2510.23032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multi-agent reasoning systems capable of collaborative decision-making. However, in financial analysis, most frameworks remain narrowly focused on either isolated single-agent predictors or loosely connected analyst ensembles, and they lack a coherent reasoning workflow that unifies diverse data modalities. We introduce P1GPT, a layered multi-agent LLM framework for multi-modal financial information analysis and interpretable trading decision support. Unlike prior systems that emulate trading teams through role simulation, P1GPT implements a structured reasoning pipeline that systematically fuses technical, fundamental, and news-based insights through coordinated agent communication and integration-time synthesis. Backtesting on multi-modal datasets across major U.S. equities demonstrates that P1GPT achieves superior cumulative and risk-adjusted returns, maintains low drawdowns, and provides transparent causal rationales. These findings suggest that structured reasoning workflows, rather than agent role imitation, offer a scalable path toward explainable and trustworthy financial AI systems.

Abstract: Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems face critical challenges in coordinating trajectory planning, task offloading, and resource allocation while ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) under dynamic and uncertain environments. Existing approaches suffer from limited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among UAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with stringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer dynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal dependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships and collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous trajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with gradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust knowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2% IoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%. Scalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers, IoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical applicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.

<title>Lost in Tokenization: Context as the Key to Unlocking Biomolecular Understanding in Scientific LLMs</title>

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising frontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language, risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality, introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines over expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid scientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis.

<title>Adapting Interleaved Encoders with PPO for Language-Guided Reinforcement Learning in BabyAI</title>

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents often struggle when tasks require understanding both vision and language. Conventional architectures typically isolate perception (for example, CNN-based visual encoders) from decision-making (policy networks). This separation can be inefficient, since the policy's failures do not directly help the perception module learn what is important. To address this, we implement the Perception-Decision Interleaving Transformer (PDiT) architecture introduced by Mao et al. (2023), a model that alternates between perception and decision layers within a single transformer. This interleaving allows feedback from decision-making to refine perceptual features dynamically. In addition, we integrate a contrastive loss inspired by CLIP to align textual mission embeddings with visual scene features. We evaluate the PDiT encoders on the BabyAI GoToLocal environment and find that the approach achieves more stable rewards and stronger alignment compared to a standard PPO baseline. The results suggest that interleaved transformer encoders are a promising direction for developing more integrated autonomous agents.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) develop anthropomorphic abilities, they are increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents to interact with humans. However, evaluating their performance in realistic and complex social interactions remains a significant challenge. Most previous research built datasets through simulated agent-to-agent interactions, which fails to capture the authentic linguistic styles and relational dynamics found in real human conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SI-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate aspects of social intelligence in LLMs. Grounded in broad social science theories, SI-Bench contains 2,221 authentic multi-turn dialogues collected from a social networking application. We further selected a subset of 312 dialogues for manual annotation across 8 major models. The experiments show that SOTA models have surpassed the human expert in process reasoning under complex social situations, yet they still fall behind humans in reply quality. Moreover, introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may degrade the performance of LLMs in social dialogue tasks. All datasets are openly available at https://github.com/SI-Bench/SI-Bench.git.

Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse 2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description, and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating VLMs is publicly available at: https://github.com/pascalbenschopTU/VLLM_AnomalyRecognition

<title>If They Disagree, Will You Conform? Exploring the Role of Robots' Value Awareness in a Decision-Making Task</title>

Abstract: This study investigates whether the opinions of robotic agents are more likely to influence human decision-making when the robots are perceived as value-aware (i.e., when they display an understanding of human principles). We designed an experiment in which participants interacted with two Furhat robots - one programmed to be Value-Aware and the other Non-Value-Aware - during a labeling task for images representing human values. Results indicate that participants distinguished the Value-Aware robot from the Non-Value-Aware one. Although their explicit choices did not indicate a clear preference for one robot over the other, participants directed their gaze more toward the Value-Aware robot. Additionally, the Value-Aware robot was perceived as more loyal, suggesting that value awareness in a social robot may enhance its perceived commitment to the group. Finally, when both robots disagreed with the participant, conformity occurred in about one out of four trials, and participants took longer to confirm their responses, suggesting that two robots expressing dissent may introduce hesitation in decision-making. On one hand, this highlights the potential risk that robots, if misused, could manipulate users for unethical purposes. On the other hand, it reinforces the idea that social robots might encourage reflection in ambiguous situations and help users avoid scams.

Abstract: While several high profile video games have served as testbeds for Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), this technique has rarely been employed by the game industry for crafting authentic AI behaviors. Previous research focuses on training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today. Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate. Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to hand-crafted agents. As a testimony of the impact of the approach, the method is intended to replace the hand-crafted counterpart in next iterations of the series.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models into Intelligent Tutoring Systems pre-sents significant challenges in aligning with diverse and often conflicting values from students, parents, teachers, and institutions. Existing architectures lack for-mal mechanisms for negotiating these multi-stakeholder tensions, creating risks in accountability and bias. This paper introduces the Advisory Governance Layer (AGL), a non-intrusive, multi-agent framework designed to enable distributed stakeholder participation in AI governance. The AGL employs specialized agents representing stakeholder groups to evaluate pedagogical actions against their spe-cific policies in a privacy-preserving manner, anticipating future advances in per-sonal assistant technology that will enhance stakeholder value expression. Through a novel policy taxonomy and conflict-resolution protocols, the frame-work provides structured, auditable governance advice to the ITS without altering its core pedagogical decision-making. This work contributes a reference architec-ture and technical specifications for aligning educational AI with multi-stakeholder values, bridging the gap between high-level ethical principles and practical implementation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assistants for developers in code-related tasks. While LLMs excel at traditional programming tasks such as code generation and bug fixing, they struggle with visually-oriented coding tasks, often producing suboptimal aesthetics. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline to enhance the aesthetic quality of LLM-generated code. We first construct AesCode-358K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset focused on code aesthetics. Next, we propose agentic reward feedback, a multi-agent system that evaluates executability, static aesthetics, and interactive aesthetics. Building on this, we develop GRPO-AR, which integrates these signals into the GRPO algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and code aesthetics. Finally, we develop OpenDesign, a benchmark for assessing code aesthetics. Experimental results show that combining supervised fine-tuning on AesCode-358K with reinforcement learning using agentic reward feedback significantly improves performance on OpenDesign and also enhances results on existing benchmarks such as PandasPlotBench. Notably, our AesCoder-4B surpasses GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, and achieves performance comparable to large open-source models with 480B-685B parameters, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL tasks have gained attractive improvements since the release of ChatGPT. Among them, agent-based frameworks have been widely used in this field. However, the impact of data-centric strategies on text-to-SQL tasks has rarely been explored. In this paper, we systemically design a fully automated data-centric pipeline for text-to-SQL tasks, including \emph{adaptive data repair}, which can automatically find and fix errors in the training dataset; and \emph{error data augmentation}, where we specifically diffuse and enhance erroneous data predicted by the initially trained models. Meanwhile, we propose a Multi-Model collaboration training schema, aiming to train multiple models with different augmented data, enabling them to possess distinct capabilities and work together to complement each other, because it has been found that the capability of a single fine-tuned model is very limited. Furthermore, we utilize an ensemble strategy to integrate the capabilities of multiple models to solve a multiple-choice question, aiming to further improve the accuracy of text-to-SQL tasks. The experiment results and ablation study have demonstrated the effectiveness of data-centric pipeline and Multi-Model(MM) interactive iterative strategies, achieving first place in lightweight text-to-SQL models (within 70B).

<title>MDReID: Modality-Decoupled Learning for Any-to-Any Multi-Modal Object Re-Identification</title>

arXiv:2510.23301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors (e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components: modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of 9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios, respectively. The code is available at: \textcolor{magenta}{https://github.com/stone96123/MDReID}.

Abstract: CNOT gates are fundamental to quantum computing, as they facilitate entanglement, a crucial resource for quantum algorithms. Certain classes of quantum circuits are constructed exclusively from CNOT gates. Given their widespread use, it is imperative to minimise the number of CNOT gates employed. This problem, known as CNOT minimisation, remains an open challenge, with its computational complexity yet to be fully characterised. In this work, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning approach to address this task. Instead of training multiple reinforcement learning agents for different circuit sizes, we use a single agent up to a fixed size $m$. Matrices of sizes different from m are preprocessed using either embedding or Gaussian striping. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we trained an agent with m = 8, and evaluated it on matrices of size n that range from 3 to 15. The results we obtained show that our method overperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm as the value of n increases.

Abstract: Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most effectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming information. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication, formalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA) modelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based on projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence attention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several timesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with a realistic model of user awareness. As the first application of RSA for communication in a dynamic environment, and for human-AI interaction in general, we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in human-agent teams, highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents.

Abstract: Data pipelines are essential in stream processing as they enable the efficient collection, processing, and delivery of real-time data, supporting rapid data analysis. In this paper, we present AutoStreamPipe, a novel framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design, generation, and deployment of stream processing pipelines. AutoStreamPipe bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured multi-agent reasoning by integrating a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) as an extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good accuracy. Experimental evaluations on diverse pipelines demonstrate that AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates (x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM code-generation methods.

Abstract: Deep Q Networks (DQN) have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement learning tasks. However, their reliance on associative learning often leads to the acquisition of spurious correlations, hindering their problem-solving capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal principles into DQNs, leveraging the PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects. By incorporating causal reasoning during training, our proposed framework enhances the DQN's understanding of the underlying causal structure of the environment, thereby mitigating the influence of confounding factors and spurious correlations. We demonstrate that integrating DQNs with causal capabilities significantly enhances their problem-solving capabilities without compromising performance. Experimental results on standard benchmark environments showcase that our approach outperforms conventional DQNs, highlighting the effectiveness of causal reasoning in reinforcement learning. Overall, our work presents a promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning agents through principled causal inference.

Abstract: Confidence in LLMs is a useful indicator of model uncertainty and answer reliability. Existing work mainly focused on single-turn scenarios, while research on confidence in complex multi-turn interactions is limited. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after long sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to outputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source agentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at high confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based on this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use confidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again until reaching a satisfactory confidence level. Results show that our proposed methods significantly reduce token consumption while demonstrating competitive performance compared to baseline fixed budget TTS methods.

Abstract: AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines, shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity, enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts, including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification, regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions, they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable, limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments. Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12 infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection environment.

Abstract: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

Abstract: Social robot navigation increasingly relies on large language models for reasoning, path planning, and enabling movement in dynamic human spaces. However, relying solely on LLMs for planning often leads to unpredictable and unsafe behaviors, especially in dynamic human spaces, due to limited physical grounding and weak logical consistency. In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a socially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a structured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM consists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that captures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the environment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a multi-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot to generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and physically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space, collision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or fine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling interpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded environments. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal reasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation.

Abstract: Dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) is a recent trend in automated machine learning, which can dynamically adjust the algorithm's configuration during the execution process and relieve users from tedious trial-and-error tuning tasks. Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have improved the configuration of multiple heterogeneous hyperparameters, making various parameter configurations for complex algorithms possible. However, many complex algorithms have inherent inter-dependencies among multiple parameters (e.g., determining the operator type first and then the operator's parameter), which are, however, not considered in previous approaches, thus leading to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose the sequential multi-agent DAC (Seq-MADAC) framework to address this issue by considering the inherent inter-dependencies of multiple parameters. Specifically, we propose a sequential advantage decomposition network, which can leverage action-order information through sequential advantage decomposition. Experiments from synthetic functions to the configuration of multi-objective optimization algorithms demonstrate Seq-MADAC's superior performance over state-of-the-art MARL methods and show strong generalization across problem classes. Seq-MADAC establishes a new paradigm for the widespread dependency-aware automated algorithm configuration. Our code is available at https://github.com/lamda-bbo/seq-madac.

<title>ReCode: Unify Plan and Action for Universal Granularity Control</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization. We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity. Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.

Abstract: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M, a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained spatio-temporal localization tasks. Full code and data are released at https://github.com/InternRobotics/EgoThinker.

<title>RobotArena $\infty$: Scalable Robot Benchmarking via Real-to-Sim Translation</title>

Abstract: The pursuit of robot generalists - instructable agents capable of performing diverse tasks across diverse environments - demands rigorous and scalable evaluation. Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally constrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models trained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments. As policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify, since defining "success" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of execution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework that overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale simulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging advances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and differentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts. Within these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from crowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup, resetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To measure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along multiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy generalization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot manipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's robotics landscape.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has spurred the emergence of data agents--autonomous systems designed to orchestrate Data + AI ecosystems for tackling complex data-related tasks. However, the term "data agent" currently suffers from terminological ambiguity and inconsistent adoption, conflating simple query responders with sophisticated autonomous architectures. This terminological ambiguity fosters mismatched user expectations, accountability challenges, and barriers to industry growth. Inspired by the SAE J3016 standard for driving automation, this survey introduces the first systematic hierarchical taxonomy for data agents, comprising six levels that delineate and trace progressive shifts in autonomy, from manual operations (L0) to a vision of generative, fully autonomous data agents (L5), thereby clarifying capability boundaries and responsibility allocation. Through this lens, we offer a structured review of existing research arranged by increasing autonomy, encompassing specialized data agents for data management, preparation, and analysis, alongside emerging efforts toward versatile, comprehensive systems with enhanced autonomy. We further analyze critical evolutionary leaps and technical gaps for advancing data agents, especially the ongoing L2-to-L3 transition, where data agents evolve from procedural execution to autonomous orchestration. Finally, we conclude with a forward-looking roadmap, envisioning the advent of proactive, generative data agents.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go, aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data. However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback (e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&amp;A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this, self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves 83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Execution algorithms are vital to modern trading, they enable market participants to execute large orders while minimising market impact and transaction costs. As these algorithms grow more sophisticated, optimising them becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for discovering optimal execution strategies, evaluated within a reactive agent-based market simulator. This simulator creates reactive order flow and allows us to decompose slippage into its constituent components: market impact and execution risk. We assess the RL agent's performance using the efficient frontier based on work by Almgren and Chriss, measuring its ability to balance risk and cost. Results show that the RL-derived strategies consistently outperform baselines and operate near the efficient frontier, demonstrating a strong ability to optimise for risk and impact. These findings highlight the potential of reinforcement learning as a powerful tool in the trader's toolkit.

Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the distributed stochastic optimization problems on compact embedded submanifolds (in the Euclidean space) for multi-agent network systems. To address the manifold structure, we propose a distributed Riemannian stochastic proximal algorithm framework by utilizing the retraction and Riemannian consensus protocol, and analyze three specific algorithms: the distributed Riemannian stochastic subgradient, proximal point, and prox-linear algorithms. When the local costs are weakly-convex and the initial points satisfy certain conditions, we show that the iterates generated by this framework converge to a nearly stationary point in expectation while achieving consensus. We further establish the convergence rate of the algorithm framework as $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1+\kappa_g}{\sqrt{k}})$ where $k$ denotes the number of iterations and $\kappa_g$ shows the impact of manifold geometry on the algorithm performance. Finally, numerical experiments are implemented to demonstrate the theoretical results and show the empirical performance.

Abstract: High-temperature superconductors are essential for next-generation energy and quantum technologies, yet their performance is often limited by the critical current density ($J_c$), which is strongly influenced by microstructural defects. Optimizing $J_c$ through defect engineering is challenging due to the complex interplay of defect type, density, and spatial correlation. Here we present an integrated workflow that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations to autonomously identify optimal defect configurations that maximize $J_c$. In our framework, TDGL simulations generate current-voltage characteristics to evaluate $J_c$, which serves as the reward signal that guides the RL agent to iteratively refine defect configurations. We find that the agent discovers optimal defect densities and correlations in two-dimensional thin-film geometries, enhancing vortex pinning and $J_c$ relative to the pristine thin-film, approaching 60\% of theoretical depairing limit with up to 15-fold enhancement compared to random initialization. This RL-driven approach provides a scalable strategy for defect engineering, with broad implications for advancing HTS applications in fusion magnets, particle accelerators, and other high-field technologies.

Abstract: The recent application of deep learning models to financial trading has heightened the need for high fidelity financial time series data. This synthetic data can be used to supplement historical data to train large trading models. The state-of-the-art models for the generative application often rely on huge amounts of historical data and large, complicated models. These models range from autoregressive and diffusion-based models through to architecturally simpler models such as the temporal-attention bilinear layer. Agent-based approaches to modelling limit order book dynamics can also recreate trading activity through mechanistic models of trader behaviours. In this work, we demonstrate how a popular agent-based framework for simulating intraday trading activity, the Chiarella model, can be combined with one of the most performant deep learning models for forecasting multi-variate time series, the TABL model. This forecasting model is coupled to a simulation of a matching engine with a novel method for simulating deleted order flow. Our simulator gives us the ability to test the generative abilities of the forecasting model using stylised facts. Our results show that this methodology generates realistic price dynamics however, when analysing deeper, parts of the markets microstructure are not accurately recreated, highlighting the necessity for including more sophisticated agent behaviors into the modeling framework to help account for tail events.

Abstract: Autonomous agents are increasingly deployed in dynamic environments where their ability to perform a given task depends on both individual and team-level proficiency. While proficiency self-assessment (PSA) has been studied for single agents, its extension to a team of agents remains underexplored. This letter addresses this gap by presenting a framework for team PSA in centralized settings. We investigate three metrics for centralized team PSA: the measurement prediction bound (MPB), the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic, and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. These metrics quantify the discrepancy between predicted and actual measurements. We use the KL divergence as a reference metric since it compares the true and predictive distributions, whereas the MPB and KS provide efficient indicators for in situ assessment. Simulation results in a target tracking scenario demonstrate that both MPB and KS metrics accurately capture model mismatches, align with the KL divergence reference, and enable real-time proficiency assessment.

Abstract: We introduce and study an online problem arising in question answering systems. In this problem, an agent must sequentially classify user-submitted queries represented by $d$-dimensional embeddings drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. The agent may consult a costly human expert for the correct label, or guess on her own without receiving feedback. The goal is to minimize regret against an oracle with free expert access. When the time horizon $T$ is at least exponential in the embedding dimension $d$, one can learn the geometry of the class regions: in this regime, we propose the Conservative Hull-based Classifier (CHC), which maintains convex hulls of expert-labeled queries and calls the expert as soon as a query lands outside all known hulls. CHC attains $\mathcal{O}(\log^d T)$ regret in $T$ and is minimax optimal for $d=1$. Otherwise, the geometry cannot be reliably learned without additional distributional assumptions. We show that when the queries are drawn from a subgaussian mixture, for $T \le e^d$, a Center-based Classifier (CC) achieves regret proportional to $N\log{N}$ where $N$ is the number of labels. To bridge these regimes, we introduce the Generalized Hull-based Classifier (GHC), a practical extension of CHC that allows for more aggressive guessing via a tunable threshold parameter. Our approach is validated with experiments, notably on real-world question-answering datasets using embeddings derived from state-of-the-art large language models.

Abstract: Machine learning models have dual-use potential, potentially serving both beneficial and malicious purposes. The development of open-source models in chemistry has specifically surfaced dual-use concerns around toxicological data and chemical warfare agents. We discuss a chain risk framework identifying three misuse pathways and corresponding mitigation strategies: inference-level, model-level, and data-level. At the data level, we introduce a model-agnostic noising method to increase prediction error in specific desired regions (sensitive regions). Our results show that selective noise induces variance and attenuation bias, whereas simply omitting sensitive data fails to prevent extrapolation. These findings hold for both molecular feature multilayer perceptrons and graph neural networks. Thus, noising molecular structures can enable open sharing of potential dual-use molecular data.

Abstract: The exploration problem is one of the main challenges in deep reinforcement learning (RL). Recent promising works tried to handle the problem with population-based methods, which collect samples with diverse behaviors derived from a population of different exploratory policies. Adaptive policy selection has been adopted for behavior control. However, the behavior selection space is largely limited by the predefined policy population, which further limits behavior diversity. In this paper, we propose a general framework called Learnable Behavioral Control (LBC) to address the limitation, which a) enables a significantly enlarged behavior selection space via formulating a hybrid behavior mapping from all policies; b) constructs a unified learnable process for behavior selection. We introduce LBC into distributed off-policy actor-critic methods and achieve behavior control via optimizing the selection of the behavior mappings with bandit-based meta-controllers. Our agents have achieved 10077.52% mean human normalized score and surpassed 24 human world records within 1B training frames in the Arcade Learning Environment, which demonstrates our significant state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance without degrading the sample efficiency.

Abstract: Reward shaping is effective in addressing the sparse-reward challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) by providing immediate feedback through auxiliary, informative rewards. Based on the reward shaping strategy, we propose a novel multi-task reinforcement learning framework that integrates a centralized reward agent (CRA) and multiple distributed policy agents. The CRA functions as a knowledge pool, aimed at distilling knowledge from various tasks and distributing it to individual policy agents to improve learning efficiency. Specifically, the shaped rewards serve as a straightforward metric for encoding knowledge. This framework not only enhances knowledge sharing across established tasks but also adapts to new tasks by transferring meaningful reward signals. We validate the proposed method on both discrete and continuous domains, including the representative Meta-World benchmark, demonstrating its robustness in multi-task sparse-reward settings and its effective transferability to unseen tasks.

Abstract: Modern engineered systems increasingly involve complex sociotechnical environments where multiple agents, including humans and the emerging paradigm of agentic AI powered by large language models, must navigate social dilemmas that pit individual interests against collective welfare. As engineered systems evolve toward multi-agent architectures with autonomous LLM-based agents, traditional governance approaches using static rules or fixed network structures fail to address the dynamic uncertainties inherent in real-world operations. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates adaptive governance mechanisms directly into the design of sociotechnical systems through a unique separation of agent interaction networks from information flow networks. We introduce a system comprising strategic LLM-based system agents that engage in repeated interactions and a reinforcement learning-based governing agent that dynamically modulates information transparency. Unlike conventional approaches that require direct structural interventions or payoff modifications, our framework preserves agent autonomy while promoting cooperation through adaptive information governance. The governing agent learns to strategically adjust information disclosure at each timestep, determining what contextual or historical information each system agent can access. Experimental results demonstrate that this RL-based governance significantly enhances cooperation compared to static information-sharing baselines.

Abstract: In the Lasry--Lions framework, Mean-Field Games (MFGs) model interactions among an infinite number of agents. However, existing algorithms either require strict monotonicity or only guarantee the convergence of averaged iterates, as in Fictitious Play in continuous time. We address this gap with the following theoretical result. First, we prove that the last-iterated policy of a proximal-point (PP) update with KL regularization converges to an equilibrium of MFG under non-strict monotonicity. Second, we see that each PP update is equivalent to finding the equilibria of a KL-regularized MFG. We then prove that this equilibrium can be found using Mirror Descent (MD) with an exponential last-iterate convergence rate. Building on these insights, we propose the Approximate Proximal-Point ($\mathtt{APP}$) algorithm, which approximately implements the PP update via a small number of MD steps. Numerical experiments on standard benchmarks confirm that the $\mathtt{APP}$ algorithm reliably converges to the unregularized mean-field equilibrium without time-averaging.

Abstract: Trajectory modeling, which includes research on trajectory data pattern mining and future prediction, has widespread applications in areas such as life services, urban transportation, and public administration. Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling. However, the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make effective and reliable trajectory modeling an important yet highly challenging endeavor, even for domain experts. \fix In this paper, we propose \textit{TrajAgent}, a agent framework powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate robust and efficient trajectory modeling through automation modeling. This framework leverages and optimizes diverse specialized models to address various trajectory modeling tasks across different datasets effectively. \unfix~In \textit{TrajAgent}, we first develop \textit{UniEnv}, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on \textit{UniEnv}, we introduce an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modeling across various trajectory tasks and data. Furthermore, we introduce collaborative learning schema between LLM-based agents and small speciallized models, to enhance the performance of the whole framework effectively. Extensive experiments on four tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{TrajAgent} in automated trajectory modeling, achieving a performance improvement of \fix 2.38\%-69.91\% \unfix over baseline methods.

Abstract: Langevin algorithms are popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian learning, particularly when the aim is to sample from the posterior distribution of a parametric model, given the input data and the prior distribution over the model parameters. Their stochastic versions such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) allow iterative learning based on randomly sampled mini-batches of large datasets and are scalable to large datasets. However, when data is decentralized across a network of agents subject to communication and privacy constraints, standard SGLD algorithms cannot be applied. Instead, we employ decentralized SGLD (DE-SGLD) algorithms, where Bayesian learning is performed collaboratively by a network of agents without sharing individual data. Nonetheless, existing DE-SGLD algorithms induce a bias at every agent that can negatively impact performance; this bias persists even when using full batches and is attributable to network effects. Motivated by the EXTRA algorithm and its generalizations for decentralized optimization, we propose the generalized EXTRA stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, which eliminates this bias in the full-batch setting. Moreover, we show that, in the mini-batch setting, our algorithm provides performance bounds that significantly improve upon those of standard DE-SGLD algorithms in the literature. Our numerical results also demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Disfluencies are a natural feature of spontaneous human speech but are typically absent from the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs). This absence can diminish the perceived naturalness of synthesized speech, which is an important criteria when building conversational agents that aim to mimick human behaviours. We show how the insertion of disfluencies can alleviate this shortcoming. The proposed approach involves (1) fine-tuning an LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to incorporate various types of disfluencies into LLM-generated utterances and (2) synthesizing those utterances using a text-to-speech model that supports the generation of speech phenomena such as disfluencies. We evaluated the quality of the generated speech across two metrics: intelligibility and perceived spontaneity. We demonstrate through a user study that the insertion of disfluencies significantly increase the perceived spontaneity of the generated speech. This increase came, however, along with a slight reduction in intelligibility.

<title>Solving the Unsolvable: Translating Case Law in Hong Kong</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges translating case law under Hong Kong's bilingual legal system. It highlights the initial success of translating all written statutes into Chinese before the 1997 handover, a task mandated by the Basic Law. The effort involved significant collaboration among legal, linguistic, and translation experts, resulting in a comprehensive and culturally appropriate bilingual legal system. However, translating case law remains a significant challenge due to the sheer volume and continuous growth of judicial decisions. The paper critiques the governments and judiciarys sporadic and uncoordinated efforts to translate case law, contrasting it with the thorough approach previously taken for statute translation. Although the government acknowledges the importance of legal bilingualism, it lacks a sustainable strategy for translating case law. The Judiciarys position that translating all judgments is unnecessary, unrealistic, and not cost-effectiveis analyzed and critiqued for its impact on legal transparency and public trust. A proposed solution involves leveraging machine translation technology through a human-machine interactive translation platform, which undergoes two major transitions. Initially based on a neural model, the platform transitions to using a large language model for improved translation accuracy. Furthermore, it evolves from a single-agent system to a multi-agent system, incorporating Translator, Annotator, and Proofreader agents. This multi-agent approach, supported by a grant, aims to facilitate efficient, high-quality translation of judicial judgments by integrating advanced artificial intelligence and continuous feedback mechanisms, thus better meeting the needs of a bilingual legal system.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Machine Learning systems everywhere raises challenges, such as dealing with interactions or competition between multiple learners. In that goal, we study multi-agent sequential decision-making by considering principal-agent interactions in a tree structure. In this problem, the reward of a player is influenced by the actions of her children, who are all self-interested and non-cooperative, hence the complexity of making good decisions. Our main finding is that it is possible to steer all the players towards the globally optimal set of actions by simply allowing single-step transfers between them. A transfer is established between a principal and one of her agents: the principal actually offers the proposed payment if the agent picks the recommended action. The analysis poses specific challenges due to the intricate interactions between the nodes of the tree and the propagation of the regret within this tree. Considering a bandit setup, we propose algorithmic solutions for the players to end up being no-regret with respect to the optimal pair of actions and incentives. In the long run, allowing transfers between players makes them act as if they were collaborating together, although they remain self-interested non-cooperative: transfers restore efficiency.

Abstract: Despite the growing interest in collaborative AI, designing systems that seamlessly integrate human input remains a major challenge. In this study, we developed a task to systematically examine human preferences for collaborative agents. We created and evaluated five collaborative AI agents with strategies that differ in the manner and degree they adapt to human actions. Participants interacted with a subset of these agents, evaluated their perceived traits, and selected their preferred agent. We used a Bayesian model to understand how agents' strategies influence the Human-AI team performance, AI's perceived traits, and the factors shaping human-preferences in pairwise agent comparisons. Our results show that agents who are more considerate of human actions are preferred over purely performance-maximizing agents. Moreover, we show that such human-centric design can improve the likability of AI collaborators without reducing performance. We find evidence for inequality-aversion effects being a driver of human choices, suggesting that people prefer collaborative agents which allow them to meaningfully contribute to the team. Taken together, these findings demonstrate how collaboration with AI can benefit from development efforts which include both subjective and objective metrics.

Abstract: Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications. However, LLM agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, without assuming that the attacker can directly modify the memory bank of the agent. The attacker injects malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps corresponding to a different target query during the agent's execution of the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link victim queries to the malicious reasoning steps. During the memory injection, we propose an indication prompt that guides the agent to autonomously generate similar bridging steps, with a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing later victim queries. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting the risk.

Abstract: Despite enthusiasm for Multi-Agent LLM Systems (MAS), their performance gains on popular benchmarks are often minimal. This gap highlights a critical need for a principled understanding of why MAS fail. Addressing this question requires systematic identification and analysis of failure patterns. We introduce MAST-Data, a comprehensive dataset of 1600+ annotated traces collected across 7 popular MAS frameworks. MAST-Data is the first multi-agent system dataset to outline the failure dynamics in MAS for guiding the development of better future systems. To enable systematic classification of failures for MAST-Data, we build the first Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy (MAST). We develop MAST through rigorous analysis of 150 traces, guided closely by expert human annotators and validated by high inter-annotator agreement (kappa = 0.88). This process identifies 14 unique modes, clustered into 3 categories: (i) system design issues, (ii) inter-agent misalignment, and (iii) task verification. To enable scalable annotation, we develop an LLM-as-a-Judge pipeline with high agreement with human annotations. We leverage MAST and MAST-Data to analyze failure patterns across models (GPT4, Claude 3, Qwen2.5, CodeLlama) and tasks (coding, math, general agent), demonstrating improvement headrooms from better MAS design. Our analysis provides insights revealing that identified failures require more sophisticated solutions, highlighting a clear roadmap for future research. We publicly release our comprehensive dataset (MAST-Data), the MAST, and our LLM annotator to facilitate widespread research and development in MAS.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently transformed from text-based assistants to autonomous agents capable of planning, reasoning, and iteratively improving their actions. While numerical reward signals and verifiers can effectively rank candidate actions, they often provide limited contextual guidance. In contrast, natural language feedback better aligns with the generative capabilities of LLMs, providing richer and more actionable suggestions. However, parsing and implementing this feedback effectively can be challenging for LLM-based agents. In this work, we introduce Critique-Guided Improvement (CGI), a novel two-player framework, comprising an actor model that explores an environment and a critic model that generates detailed nature language feedback. By training the critic to produce fine-grained assessments and actionable revisions, and the actor to utilize these critiques, our approach promotes more robust exploration of alternative strategies while avoiding local optima. Experiments in three interactive environments show that CGI outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin. Notably, even a small critic model surpasses GPT-4 in feedback quality. The resulting actor achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the power of explicit iterative guidance to enhance decision-making in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: We present a novel, open-source social network simulation framework, MOSAIC, where generative language agents predict user behaviors such as liking, sharing, and flagging content. This simulation combines LLM agents with a directed social graph to analyze emergent deception behaviors and gain a better understanding of how users determine the veracity of online social content. By constructing user representations from diverse fine-grained personas, our system enables multi-agent simulations that model content dissemination and engagement dynamics at scale. Within this framework, we evaluate three different content moderation strategies with simulated misinformation dissemination, and we find that they not only mitigate the spread of non-factual content but also increase user engagement. In addition, we analyze the trajectories of popular content in our simulations, and explore whether simulation agents' articulated reasoning for their social interactions truly aligns with their collective engagement patterns. We open-source our simulation software to encourage further research within AI and social sciences.

Abstract: Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) play a crucial role in maritime operations, yet their navigation in shallow-water environments remains challenging due to dynamic disturbances and depth constraints. Traditional navigation strategies struggle with limited sensor information, making safe and efficient operation difficult. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for ASV navigation under depth constraints, where the vehicle must reach a target while avoiding unsafe areas with only a single depth measurement per timestep from a downward-facing Single Beam Echosounder (SBES). To enhance environmental awareness, we integrate Gaussian Process (GP) regression into the RL framework, enabling the agent to progressively estimate a bathymetric depth map from sparse sonar readings. This approach improves decision-making by providing a richer representation of the environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate effective sim-to-real transfer, ensuring that trained policies generalize well to real-world aquatic conditions. Experimental results validate our method's capability to improve ASV navigation performance while maintaining safety in challenging shallow-water environments.

Abstract: As Large Language Models are rapidly deployed across diverse applications from healthcare to financial advice, safety evaluation struggles to keep pace. Current benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions with generic policies, failing to capture the conversational dynamics of real-world usage and the application-specific harms that emerge in context. Such potential oversights can lead to harms that go unnoticed in standard safety benchmarks and other current evaluation methodologies. To address these needs for robust AI safety evaluation, we introduce SAGE (Safety AI Generic Evaluation), an automated modular framework designed for customized and dynamic harm evaluations. SAGE employs prompted adversarial agents with diverse personalities based on the Big Five model, enabling system-aware multi-turn conversations that adapt to target applications and harm policies. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs across three applications and harm policies. Multi-turn experiments show that harm increases with conversation length, model behavior varies significantly when exposed to different user personalities and scenarios, and some models minimize harm via high refusal rates that reduce usefulness. We also demonstrate policy sensitivity within a harm category where tightening a child-focused sexual policy substantially increases measured defects across applications. These results motivate adaptive, policy-aware, and context-specific testing for safer real-world deployment.

Abstract: The growing spread of online misinformation has created an urgent need for scalable, reliable fact-checking solutions. Crowdsourced fact-checking - where non-experts evaluate claim veracity - offers a cost-effective alternative to expert verification, despite concerns about variability in quality and bias. Encouraged by promising results in certain contexts, major platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram have begun shifting from centralized moderation to decentralized, crowd-based approaches.
  In parallel, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across core fact-checking tasks, including claim detection and evidence evaluation. However, their potential role in crowdsourced workflows remains unexplored. This paper investigates whether LLM-powered generative agents - autonomous entities that emulate human behavior and decision-making - can meaningfully contribute to fact-checking tasks traditionally reserved for human crowds.
  Using the protocol of La Barbera et al. (2024), we simulate crowds of generative agents with diverse demographic and ideological profiles. Agents retrieve evidence, assess claims along multiple quality dimensions, and issue final veracity judgments. Our results show that agent crowds outperform human crowds in truthfulness classification, exhibit higher internal consistency, and show reduced susceptibility to social and cognitive biases. Compared to humans, agents rely more systematically on informative criteria such as Accuracy, Precision, and Informativeness, suggesting a more structured decision-making process. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of generative agents as scalable, consistent, and less biased contributors to crowd-based fact-checking systems.

Abstract: There is a growing need for social robots and intelligent agents that can effectively interact with and support users. For the interactions to be seamless, the agents need to analyse social scenes and behavioural cues from their (robot's) perspective. Works that model human-agent interactions in social situations are few; and even those existing ones are computationally too intensive to be deployed in real time or perform poorly in real-world scenarios when only limited information is available. We propose a knowledge distillation framework that models social interactions through various multimodal cues, and yet is robust against incomplete and noisy information during inference. We train a teacher model with multimodal input (body, face and hand gestures, gaze, raw images) that transfers knowledge to a student model which relies solely on body pose. Extensive experiments on two publicly available human-robot interaction datasets demonstrate that our student model achieves an average accuracy gain of 14.75% over competitive baselines on multiple downstream social understanding tasks, even with up to 51% of its input being corrupted. The student model is also highly efficient - less than 1% in size of the teacher model in terms of parameters and its latency is 11.9% of the teacher model. Our code and related data are available at github.com/biantongfei/SocialEgoMobile.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding, the ability to map natural language instructions to specific actions on graphical user interfaces, remains a critical bottleneck in computer use agent development. Current benchmarks oversimplify grounding tasks as short referring expressions, failing to capture the complexity of real-world interactions that require software commonsense, layout understanding, and fine-grained manipulation capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce OSWorld-G, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 564 finely annotated samples across diverse task types including text matching, element recognition, layout understanding, and precise manipulation. Additionally, we synthesize and release the largest computer use grounding dataset Jedi, which contains 4 million examples through multi-perspective decoupling of tasks. Our multi-scale models trained on Jedi demonstrate its effectiveness by outperforming existing approaches on ScreenSpot-v2, ScreenSpot-Pro, and our OSWorld-G. Furthermore, we demonstrate that improved grounding with Jedi directly enhances agentic capabilities of general foundation models on complex computer tasks, improving from 5% to 27% on OSWorld. Through detailed ablation studies, we identify key factors contributing to grounding performance and verify that combining specialized data for different interface elements enables compositional generalization to novel interfaces. All benchmark, data, checkpoints, and code are open-sourced and available at https://osworld-grounding.github.io.

Abstract: Consensus algorithms are fundamental to multi-agent distributed optimization, and their security under adversarial conditions is an active area of research. While prior works primarily establish conditions for successful global consensus under attack, little is known about system behavior when these conditions are violated. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the robustness of the Wang--Elia algorithm, which is a robust to noise version of gradient tracking algorithm, in the presence of malicious agents. We consider a network of agents collaboratively minimizing a global cost function, where a subset of agents may transmit faulty information to disrupt consensus. To quantify resilience, we formulate a security metric as an optimization problem, which is rooted in centralized attack detection literature. We provide a tractable reformulation of the optimization problem, and derive conditions under which the metric becomes unbounded, identifying undetectable attack signals that reveal inherent vulnerabilities. To facilitate design and analysis, we propose a well-posed variant of the metric and propose design methods to enhance network robustness against stealthy adversarial attacks. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework to enhance the resilience of multi-agent distributed optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled intelligent agents from reactive responses to proactive support. While promising, existing proactive agents either rely exclusively on observations from enclosed environments (e.g., desktop UIs) with direct LLM inference or employ rule-based proactive notifications, leading to suboptimal user intent understanding and limited functionality for proactive service. In this paper, we introduce ContextAgent, the first context-aware proactive agent that incorporates extensive sensory contexts surrounding humans to enhance the proactivity of LLM agents. ContextAgent first extracts multi-dimensional contexts from massive sensory perceptions on wearables (e.g., video and audio) to understand user intentions. ContextAgent then leverages the sensory contexts and personas from historical data to predict the necessity for proactive services. When proactive assistance is needed, ContextAgent further automatically calls the necessary tools to assist users unobtrusively. To evaluate this new task, we curate ContextAgentBench, the first benchmark for evaluating context-aware proactive LLM agents, covering 1,000 samples across nine daily scenarios and twenty tools. Experiments on ContextAgentBench show that ContextAgent outperforms baselines by achieving up to 8.5% and 6.0% higher accuracy in proactive predictions and tool calling, respectively. We hope our research can inspire the development of more advanced, human-centric, proactive AI assistants. The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/openaiotlab/ContextAgent.

Abstract: Developing high-performance software is a complex task that requires specialized expertise. We introduce GSO, a benchmark for evaluating language models' capabilities in developing high-performance software. We develop an automated pipeline that generates and executes performance tests to analyze repository commit histories to identify 102 challenging optimization tasks across 10 codebases, spanning diverse domains and programming languages. An agent is provided with a codebase and performance test as a precise specification, and tasked to improve the runtime efficiency, which is measured against the expert developer optimization. Our quantitative evaluation reveals that leading SWE-Agents struggle significantly, achieving less than 5% success rate, with limited improvements even with inference-time scaling. Our qualitative analysis identifies key failure modes, including difficulties with low-level languages, practicing lazy optimization strategies, and challenges in accurately localizing bottlenecks. We release the code and artifacts of our benchmark along with agent trajectories to enable future research.

<title>Hierarchical Language Models for Semantic Navigation and Manipulation in an Aerial-Ground Robotic System</title>

Abstract: Heterogeneous multirobot systems show great potential in complex tasks requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, existing methods that rely on static or task-specific models often lack generalizability across diverse tasks and dynamic environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical multimodal framework that integrates a prompted large language model (LLM) with a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM). At the system level, the LLM performs hierarchical task decomposition and constructs a global semantic map, while the VLM provides semantic perception and object localization, where the proposed GridMask significantly enhances the VLM's spatial accuracy for reliable fine-grained manipulation. The aerial robot leverages this global map to generate semantic paths and guide the ground robot's local navigation and manipulation, ensuring robust coordination even in target-absent or ambiguous scenarios. We validate the framework through extensive simulation and real-world experiments on long-horizon object arrangement tasks, demonstrating zero-shot adaptability, robust semantic navigation, and reliable manipulation in dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first heterogeneous aerial-ground robotic system that integrates VLM-based perception with LLM-driven reasoning for global high-level task planning and execution.

However, two notable challenges remain in fully harnessing in-context learning within RL domains: the intrinsic multi-modality of the state-action-reward data and the diverse, heterogeneous nature of decision tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose T2MIR (Token- and Task-wise MoE for In-context RL), an innovative framework that introduces architectural advances of mixture-of-experts (MoE) into transformer-based decision models. T2MIR substitutes the feedforward layer with two parallel layers: a token-wise MoE that captures distinct semantics of input tokens across multiple modalities, and a task-wise MoE that routes diverse tasks to specialized experts for managing a broad task distribution with alleviated gradient conflicts. To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a contrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the task and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of task-relevant information. The outputs of two MoE components are concatenated and fed into the next layer. Comprehensive experiments show that T2MIR significantly facilitates in-context learning capacity and outperforms various types of baselines. We bring the potential and promise of MoE to ICRL, offering a simple and scalable architectural enhancement to advance ICRL one step closer toward achievements in language and vision communities. Our code is available at https://github.com/NJU-RL/T2MIR.

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints, this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework, providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches. Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

<title>When Can Model-Free Reinforcement Learning be Enough for Thinking?</title>

Abstract: Recent work on large language models has demonstrated the use of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning-like capabilities. The emergence of "thinking" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither produce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is more likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent understanding of when model-free RL will lead to such "thinking" as a strategy for reward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a theoretical model which we call a thought Markov decision process (MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an abstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP model, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether or not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent to the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing to act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our theory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like behavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable thinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy domain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought actions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents.

Abstract: Self-evolution, the ability of agents to autonomously improve their reasoning and behavior, is essential for the embodied domain with long-horizon, real-world tasks. Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential to enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions remains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two fundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible intermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning signals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts generalization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we present Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework designed for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents. Specifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate signals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative policy optimization (Tree-GRPO) integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into GRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting autonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce Multi-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the effectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 46.27% (multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also achieves scores of 80.3% (textual) and 44.03% (multi-modal) without ground truth reward, surpassing all open-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving embodied agent. Additional experiments and qualitative analysis further support the potential of SEEA-R1 for future research in scalable embodied intelligence.

Abstract: When building a world model, a common assumption is that the environment has a single, unchanging underlying causal rule, like applying Newton's laws to every situation. In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a \textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3) iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously unseen contexts.

Abstract: AI agent frameworks operate in isolation, forcing agents to rediscover solutions and repeat mistakes across different systems. Despite valuable problem-solving experiences accumulated by frameworks like smolagents, OpenHands, and OWL, this knowledge remains trapped within individual systems, preventing the emergence of collective intelligence. Current memory systems focus on individual agents or framework-specific demonstrations, failing to enable cross-architecture knowledge transfer. We introduce AGENT KB, a universal memory infrastructure enabling seamless experience sharing across heterogeneous agent frameworks without retraining. AGENT KB aggregates trajectories into a structured knowledge base and serves lightweight APIs. At inference time, hybrid retrieval operates through two stages: planning seeds agents with cross-domain workflows, while feedback applies targeted diagnostic fixes. A disagreement gate ensures retrieved knowledge enhances rather than disrupts reasoning, addressing knowledge interference in cross-framework transfer. We validate AGENT KB across major frameworks on GAIA, Humanity's Last Exam, GPQA, and SWE-bench. Results show substantial improvements across diverse model families: compared to baseline pass@1, smolagents with AGENT KB achieve up to 18.7pp gains at pass@3 (55.2% -> 73.9%), while OpenHands improves 4.0pp on SWE-bench pass@1 (24.3% -> 28.3%). Similar improvements are observed across all base model families. Ablations confirm that hybrid retrieval and feedback stages are essential, with automatically generated experiences matching manual curation. This establishes the foundation for collective agent intelligence through shared memory infrastructures.

Abstract: Grounding language in perception and action is a key challenge when building situated agents that can interact with humans, or other agents, via language. In the past, addressing this challenge has required manually designing the language grounding or curating massive datasets that associate language with the environment. We propose Ground-Compose-Reinforce, an end-to-end, neurosymbolic framework for training RL agents directly from high-level task specifications--without manually designed reward functions or other domain-specific oracles, and without massive datasets. These task specifications take the form of Reward Machines, automata-based representations that capture high-level task structure and are in some cases autoformalizable from natural language. Critically, we show that Reward Machines can be grounded using limited data by exploiting compositionality. Experiments in a custom Meta-World domain with only 350 labelled pretraining trajectories show that our framework faithfully elicits complex behaviours from high-level specifications--including behaviours that never appear in pretraining--while non-compositional approaches fail.

Abstract: Evaluating the scientific discovery capabilities of large language model based agents, particularly how they cope with varying environmental complexity and utilize prior knowledge, requires specialized benchmarks currently lacking in the landscape. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{PhysGym}, a novel benchmark suite and simulation platform for rigorously assessing LLM-based scientific reasoning in interactive physics environments. \textsc{PhysGym}'s primary contribution lies in its sophisticated control over the level of prior knowledge provided to the agent. This allows researchers to dissect agent performance along axes including the complexity of the problem and the prior knowledge levels. The benchmark comprises a suite of interactive simulations, where agents must actively probe environments, gather data sequentially under constraints and formulate hypotheses about underlying physical laws. \textsc{PhysGym} provides standardized evaluation protocols and metrics for assessing hypothesis accuracy and model fidelity. We demonstrate the benchmark's utility by presenting results from baseline LLMs, showcasing its ability to differentiate capabilities based on varying priors and task complexity.

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term tactical decisions consistent with long-term financial objectives. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been applied to such problems, but adoption is limited by myopic behaviour and opaque policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer complementary strategic reasoning and multi-modal signal interpretation when guided by well-structured prompts. This paper proposes a hybrid framework in which LLMs generate high-level trading strategies to guide RL agents. We evaluate (i) the economic rationale of LLM-generated strategies through expert review, and (ii) the performance of LLM-guided agents against unguided RL baselines using Sharpe Ratio (SR) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD). Empirical results indicate that LLM guidance improves both return and risk metrics relative to standard RL.

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking, AI agents can parse webpages or interact through APIs to evaluate products, and transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy-and why? We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic agent with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this. We first explore aggregate choices, revealing that modal choices can differ across models, with AI agents sometimes concentrating on a few products, raising competition questions. We then analyze the drivers of choices through rationality checks and randomized experiments on product positions and listing attributes. Models show sizeable and heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption of a universal ``top'' rank. They penalize sponsored tags, reward endorsements, and sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally as expected, but vary sharply across models. Finally, we find that a seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions can deliver substantial market-share gains by targeting AI buyer preferences. Our findings reveal how AI agents behave in e-commerce, and surface concrete seller strategy, platform design, and regulatory questions.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems. MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components: agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines, goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies. Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short, providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI oversight.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability, efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online RL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements, with 78.0% and 34.3% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 100 turns and output tokens exceeding 400k during training time. With a simple agent design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 51.1 on xBench and 58.7 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. Finally, we also show that ASearcher-Web-QwQ could achieve performance of commercial systems using external summary tool in a zero-shot transfer manner and test-time search. We open-source our models, training data, and codes in https://github.com/inclusionAI/ASearcher.

Abstract: In this paper we evaluate the capabilities of LLM Agents in generating code for real-world problems. Specifically, we explore code synthesis for microservice-based applications, a widely used architectural pattern for building applications. We define a standard template for specifying these applications, and we propose a metric for scoring the difficulty of a specification. The higher the score, the more difficult it is to generate code for the specification. Our experimental results show that agents using strong LLMs (like GPT-3o-mini) do fairly well on medium difficulty specifications but do poorly on those of higher difficulty levels. This is due to more intricate business logic, a greater use of external services, database integration and inclusion of non-functional capabilities such as authentication. We analyzed the errors in LLM-synthesized code and report on the key challenges LLM Agents face in generating code for these specifications. Finally, we show that using a fine-grained approach to code generation improves the correctness of the generated code.

Abstract: The focus of AI development has shifted from academic research to practical applications. However, AI development faces numerous challenges at various levels. This article will attempt to analyze the opportunities and challenges of AI from several different perspectives using a structured approach. This article proposes a seven-layer model for AI compute architecture, including Physical Layer, Link Layer, Neural Network Layer, Context Layer, Agent Layer, Orchestrator Layer, and Application Layer, from bottom to top. It also explains how AI computing has evolved into this 7-layer architecture through the three-stage evolution on large-scale language models (LLMs). For each layer, we describe the development trajectory and key technologies. In Layers 1 and 2 we discuss AI computing issues and the impact of Scale-Up and Scale-Out strategies on computing architecture. In Layer 3 we explore two different development paths for LLMs. In Layer 4 we discuss the impact of contextual memory on LLMs and compares it to traditional processor memory. In Layers 5 to 7 we discuss the trends of AI agents and explore the issues in evolution from a single AI agent to an AI-based ecosystem, and their impact on the AI industry. Furthermore, AI development involves not only technical challenges but also the economic issues to build self-sustainable ecosystem. This article analyzes the internet industry to provide predictions on the future trajectory of AI development.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long, expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering (SE) agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present a systematic comparison of these approaches within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified across five diverse model configurations. Moreover, we show initial evidence of our findings generalizing to the OpenHands agent scaffold. We find that a simple environment observation masking strategy halves cost relative to the raw agent while matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM summarization. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid approach that further reduces costs by 7% and 11% compared to just observation masking or LLM summarization, respectively. Our findings raise concerns regarding the trend towards pure LLM summarization and provide initial evidence of untapped cost reductions by pushing the efficiency-effectiveness frontier. We release code and data for reproducibility.

Abstract: Patients must possess the knowledge necessary to actively participate in their care. We present NoteAid-Chatbot, a conversational AI that promotes patient understanding via a novel 'learning as conversation' framework, built on a multi-agent large language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL) setup without human-labeled data. NoteAid-Chatbot was built on a lightweight LLaMA 3.2 3B model trained in two stages: initial supervised fine-tuning on conversational data synthetically generated using medical conversation strategies, followed by RL with rewards derived from patient understanding assessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios. Our evaluation, which includes comprehensive human-aligned assessments and case studies, demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot exhibits key emergent behaviors critical for patient education, such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue, even though it received no explicit supervision for these attributes. Our results show that even simple Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reward modeling can successfully train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots to handle multi-turn interactions, incorporate diverse educational strategies, and meet nuanced communication objectives. Our Turing test demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot surpasses non-expert human. Although our current focus is on healthcare, the framework we present illustrates the feasibility and promise of applying low-cost, PPO-based RL to realistic, open-ended conversational domains, broadening the applicability of RL-based alignment methods.

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies, limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C, a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring efficiency throughout the learning process.

Abstract: The social science of large language models (LLMs) examines how these systems evoke mind attributions, interact with one another, and transform human activity and institutions. We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies, combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks, learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field, clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field, challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score), combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g., marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments, EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning, generative annotation, and multimodal data integration. However, progress remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC, multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation, trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness, privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven single-cell intelligence and outlines open challenges in interpretability, standardization, and trustworthy model development.

<title>Sketch2BIM: A Multi-Agent Human-AI Collaborative Pipeline to Convert Hand-Drawn Floor Plans to 3D BIM</title>

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled, hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later, these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence: openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision, recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE) progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

Abstract: Effective research relies on organizing extensive information and stimulating novel solutions. Agentic systems have recently emerged as a promising tool to automate literature-based ideation. However, current systems often remain black-box. Their outputs may appear plausible but weakly grounded, with limited transparency or control for researchers. Our work introduces \textsc{autoresearcher}, a multi-agent demo system for knowledge-grounded and transparent ideation. Specifically, \textsc{autoresearcher} integrates meticulously designed four stages into a unified framework: (A) Structured Knowledge Curation, (B) Diversified Idea Generation, (C) Multi-stage Idea Selection, and (D) Expert Panel Review \& Synthesis. Different from prior pipelines, our system not only exposes intermediate reasoning states, execution logs, and tunable agents for inspections, but also enables the generation of hypotheses that are both diverse and evidence-aligned. Our design is also domain-agnostic: as long as literature sources exist, the same pipeline can be instantiated in any scientific field. As an illustrative case, we demonstrate \textsc{autoresearcher} on a graph-mining case study ($k$-truss breaking problem), where it generates distinct, plausible hypotheses with evidence and critiques. A live demo and source code are available at https://github.com/valleysprings/AutoResearcher.

<title>Cultural Alien Sampler: Open-ended art generation balancing originality and coherence</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20849</link>

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models (LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation (N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

Abstract: Landslides are a growing climate induced hazard with severe environmental and human consequences, particularly in high mountain Asia. Despite increasing access to satellite and temporal datasets, timely detection and disaster response remain underdeveloped and fragmented. This work introduces CC-GRMAS, a framework leveraging a series of satellite observations and environmental signals to enhance the accuracy of landslide forecasting. The system is structured around three interlinked agents Prediction, Planning, and Execution, which collaboratively enable real time situational awareness, response planning, and intervention. By incorporating local environmental factors and operationalizing multi agent coordination, this approach offers a scalable and proactive solution for climate resilient disaster preparedness across vulnerable mountainous terrains.

<title>Shoot First, Ask Questions Later? Building Rational Agents that Explore and Act Like People</title>

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration (asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next, to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs, such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for building rational information-seeking agents.

<title>Towards Scalable Oversight with Collaborative Multi-Agent Debate in Error Detection</title>

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate (MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection. However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements over single-agent methods in error detection.

<title>AgentArcEval: An Architecture Evaluation Method for Foundation Model based Agents</title>

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models (FMs) has enabled the development of highly capable and autonomous agents, unlocking new application opportunities across a wide range of domains. Evaluating the architecture of agents is particularly important as the architectural decisions significantly impact the quality attributes of agents given their unique characteristics, including compound architecture, autonomous and non-deterministic behaviour, and continuous evolution. However, these traditional methods fall short in addressing the evaluation needs of agent architecture due to the unique characteristics of these agents. Therefore, in this paper, we present AgentArcEval, a novel agent architecture evaluation method designed specially to address the complexities of FM-based agent architecture and its evaluation. Moreover, we present a catalogue of agent-specific general scenarios, which serves as a guide for generating concrete scenarios to design and evaluate the agent architecture. We demonstrate the usefulness of AgentArcEval and the catalogue through a case study on the architecture evaluation of a real-world tax copilot, named Luna.

<title>Low Cost, Fair, and Representative Committees in a Metric Space</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a representative committee of $k$ agents from a collection of $n$ agents in a common metric space. This problem is related to choosing $k$ facilities in facility location and $k$-median problems. However, unlike in more traditional facility location where each agent only cares about the closest selected facility, in the settings we consider each agent desires that all selected committee members are close to them. More precisely, we look at the sum objective, in which the goal is to minimize the total distance from all agents to all members of the chosen committee. We show that it is always possible to find a committee which is both low-cost according to this objective, and also fair according to many existing notions of fairness and proportionality defined for clustering settings. Moreover, we introduce a new desirable axiom for representative committees we call NORP, which prevents over-representation of any subset of agents. While all existing algorithms for fair committee selection do not satisfy this intuitive property, we provide new algorithms which form simultaneously low-cost, fair, and NORP solutions, thus showing that it is always possible to form low-cost, fair, and representative committees for our settings.

<title>From Questions to Queries: An AI-powered Multi-Agent Framework for Spatial Text-to-SQL</title>

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL), single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components, including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems, advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

<title>Online Multi-Class Selection with Group Fairness Guarantee</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.21055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature. First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution. Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism -- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in practical settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic systems that interact with an external environment; this makes them susceptible to prompt injections when dealing with untrusted data. To overcome this limitation, we propose SIC (Soft Instruction Control)-a simple yet effective iterative prompt sanitization loop designed for tool-augmented LLM agents. Our method repeatedly inspects incoming data for instructions that could compromise agent behavior. If such content is found, the malicious content is rewritten, masked, or removed, and the result is re-evaluated. The process continues until the input is clean or a maximum iteration limit is reached; if imperative instruction-like content remains, the agent halts to ensure security. By allowing multiple passes, our approach acknowledges that individual rewrites may fail but enables the system to catch and correct missed injections in later steps. Although immediately useful, worst-case analysis shows that SIC is not infallible; strong adversary can still get a 15% ASR by embedding non-imperative workflows. This nonetheless raises the bar.

<title>ESCORT: Efficient Stein-variational and Sliced Consistency-Optimized Temporal Belief Representation for POMDPs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.21107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and downstream decision quality.

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures. Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved confounders exist.

<title>PhysVLM-AVR: Active Visual Reasoning for Multimodal Large Language Models in Physical Environments</title>

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception, reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR, embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath, Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap in active reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

<title>Generalizable Hierarchical Skill Learning via Object-Centric Representation</title>

arXiv:2510.21121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Generalizable Hierarchical Skill Learning (GSL), a novel framework for hierarchical policy learning that significantly improves policy generalization and sample efficiency in robot manipulation. One core idea of GSL is to use object-centric skills as an interface that bridges the high-level vision-language model and the low-level visual-motor policy. Specifically, GSL decomposes demonstrations into transferable and object-canonicalized skill primitives using foundation models, ensuring efficient low-level skill learning in the object frame. At test time, the skill-object pairs predicted by the high-level agent are fed to the low-level module, where the inferred canonical actions are mapped back to the world frame for execution. This structured yet flexible design leads to substantial improvements in sample efficiency and generalization of our method across unseen spatial arrangements, object appearances, and task compositions. In simulation, GSL trained with only 3 demonstrations per task outperforms baselines trained with 30 times more data by 15.5 percent on unseen tasks. In real-world experiments, GSL also surpasses the baseline trained with 10 times more data.

<title>Digital Contrast CT Pulmonary Angiography Synthesis from Non-contrast CT for Pulmonary Vascular Disease</title>

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on 249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics (For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE: 165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization, demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70, 0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities, stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) -- to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

Abstract: We study hypothesis testing over a heterogeneous population of strategic agents with private information. Any single test applied uniformly across the population yields statistical error that is sub-optimal relative to the performance of an oracle given access to the private information. We show how it is possible to design menus of statistical contracts that pair type-optimal tests with payoff structures, inducing agents to self-select according to their private information. This separating menu elicits agent types and enables the principal to match the oracle performance even without a priori knowledge of the agent type. Our main result fully characterizes the collection of all separating menus that are instance-adaptive, matching oracle performance for an arbitrary population of heterogeneous agents. We identify designs where information elicitation is essentially costless, requiring negligible additional expense relative to a single-test benchmark, while improving statistical performance. Our work establishes a connection between proper scoring rules and menu design, showing how the structure of the hypothesis test constrains the elicitable information. Numerical examples illustrate the geometry of separating menus and the improvements they deliver in error trade-offs. Overall, our results connect statistical decision theory with mechanism design, demonstrating how heterogeneity and strategic participation can be harnessed to improve efficiency in hypothesis testing.

<title>Green Hydrogen under Uncertainty: Evaluating Power-to-X Strategies Using Agent-Based Simulation and Multi-Criteria Decision Framework</title>

Abstract: The transition toward net-zero energy systems requires scalable and cost-effective deployment of Power-to-X technologies, particularly green hydrogen production. Despite increasing investments, a critical research gap remains in dynamically assessing how different operational strategies affect the feasibility of hydrogen production under real-world energy market conditions. Most existing studies rely on static, techno-economic models and overlook actor interactions, infrastructure limitations, and regulatory complexity. This paper presents a novel modeling framework that integrates agent-based simulation with multi-criteria decision-making to evaluate green hydrogen production strategies using co-located wind and solar generation. Three operational strategies - grid-only, on-site-only, and hybrid - are applied across three electrolyzer capacity levels (10 MW, 50 MW, and 100 MW) within a Danish case study. Real electricity tariffs, emissions factors, and market data are used to simulate technical, economic, and environmental performance indicators. The results show that hybrid strategies consistently outperform grid-only configurations in terms of cost and emissions while maintaining stable hydrogen output. Although on-site-only strategies minimize emissions and costs, they fail to meet fixed production demands. This framework offers novel scientific contributions by modeling dynamic actor interactions and integrating system performance evaluation into strategic planning. Practically, it provides actionable insights for energy planners and policymakers designing resilient and efficient Power-to-X systems in renewable-rich contexts.

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining, predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions, and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies. However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications. Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias, resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

Abstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded, LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods: We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment, readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 % contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 % impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced AI agents into emergency response workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into AI agents that interact with external tools and environments to perform complex tasks. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become the de facto standard for connecting agents with such resources, but security has lagged behind: thousands of MCP servers execute with unrestricted access to host systems, creating a broad attack surface. In this paper, we introduce AgentBound, the first access control framework for MCP servers. AgentBound combines a declarative policy mechanism, inspired by the Android permission model, with a policy enforcement engine that contains malicious behavior without requiring MCP server modifications. We build a dataset containing the 296 most popular MCP servers, and show that access control policies can be generated automatically from source code with 80.9% accuracy. We also show that AgentBound blocks the majority of security threats in several malicious MCP servers, and that policy enforcement engine introduces negligible overhead. Our contributions provide developers and project managers with a practical foundation for securing MCP servers while maintaining productivity, enabling researchers and tool builders to explore new directions for declarative access control and MCP security.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence. However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code, resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings. These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised (e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and actions.

<title>Revisiting Social Welfare in Bandits: UCB is (Nearly) All You Need</title>

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret, which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards, aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the $p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all $p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret bounds.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc. However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated, multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning: Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly, defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories, synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this \href{https://github.com/laojiahuo2003/CXRAgent/}{link}.

<title>Randomized Neural Network with Adaptive Forward Regularization for Online Task-free Class Incremental Learning</title>

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization, has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R) in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention. edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning. Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

Abstract: GenAI-based coding assistants have disrupted software development. Their next generation is agent-based, operating with more autonomy and potentially without human oversight. One challenge is to provide AI agents with sufficient context about the software projects they operate in. Like humans, AI agents require contextual information to develop solutions that are in line with the target architecture, interface specifications, coding guidelines, standard workflows, and other project-specific policies. Popular AI agents for software development (e.g., Claude Code) advocate for maintaining tool-specific version-controlled Markdown files that cover aspects such as the project structure, building and testing, or code style. The content of these files is automatically added to each prompt. AGENTS.md has emerged as a potential standard that consolidates tool-specific formats. However, little is known about whether and how developers adopt this format. Therefore, in this paper, we present the results of a preliminary study investigating the adoption of AI configuration files in 466 open-source software projects, what information developers provide in these files, how they present that information, and how they evolve over time. Our findings indicate that there is no established structure yet, and that there is a lot of variation in terms of how context is provided (descriptive, prescriptive, prohibitive, explanatory, conditional). We see great potential in studying which modifications in structure or presentation can positively affect the quality of the generated content. Finally, our analysis of commits that have modified AGENTS.md files provides first insights into how projects continuously extend and maintain these files. We conclude the paper by outlining how the adoption of AI configuration files in provides a unique opportunity to study real-world prompt and context engineering.

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids, challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts. To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations (ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation baselines.

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Designing incentives for a multi-agent system to induce a desirable Nash equilibrium is both a crucial and challenging problem appearing in many decision-making domains, especially for a large number of agents $N$. Under the exchangeability assumption, we formalize this incentive design (ID) problem as a parameterized mean-field game (PMFG), aiming to reduce complexity via an infinite-population limit. We first show that when dynamics and rewards are Lipschitz, the finite-$N$ ID objective is approximated by the PMFG at rate $\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$. Moreover, beyond the Lipschitz-continuous setting, we prove the same $\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ decay for the important special case of sequential auctions, despite discontinuities in dynamics, through a tailored auction-specific analysis. Built on our novel approximation results, we further introduce our Adjoint Mean-Field Incentive Design (AMID) algorithm, which uses explicit differentiation of iterated equilibrium operators to compute gradients efficiently. By uniting approximation bounds with optimization guarantees, AMID delivers a powerful, scalable algorithmic tool for many-agent (large $N$) ID. Across diverse auction settings, the proposed AMID method substantially increases revenue over first-price formats and outperforms existing benchmark methods.

<title>REMONI: An Autonomous System Integrating Wearables and Multimodal Large Language Models for Enhanced Remote Health Monitoring</title>

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased. Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data, visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices. The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness of its various capabilities.

<title>SBASH: a Framework for Designing and Evaluating RAG vs. Prompt-Tuned LLM Honeypots</title>

Abstract: Honeypots are decoy systems used for gathering valuable threat intelligence or diverting attackers away from production systems. Maximising attacker engagement is essential to their utility. However research has highlighted that context-awareness, such as the ability to respond to new attack types, systems and attacker agents, is necessary to increase engagement. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer from several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time, high operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We propose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which manages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We investigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and non-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different metrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and similarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and BertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models that have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a Linux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while having a slightly lower latency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection, bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions. Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn and multilingual interactions. We release our code on \href{https://github.com/ilijalichkovski/eu-agent-bench}{this URL}.

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles, modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices (UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning, computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game (MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence stability and scalability.

<title>Auction-Based Responsibility Allocation for Scalable Decentralized Safety Filters in Cooperative Multi-Agent Collision Avoidance</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21546</link>

Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable decentralized safety filter for multi-agent systems based on high-order control barrier functions (HOCBFs) and auction-based responsibility allocation. While decentralized HOCBF formulations ensure pairwise safety under input bounds, they face feasibility and scalability challenges as the number of agents grows. Each agent must evaluate an increasing number of pairwise constraints, raising the risk of infeasibility and making it difficult to meet real-time requirements. To address this, we introduce an auction-based allocation scheme that distributes constraint enforcement asymmetrically among neighbors based on local control effort estimates. The resulting directed responsibility graph guarantees full safety coverage while reducing redundant constraints and per-agent computational load. Simulation results confirm safe and efficient coordination across a range of network sizes and interaction densities.

<title>System-Theoretic Analysis of Dynamic Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problems -- Turnpikes and Dissipativity</title>

Abstract: Generalized Nash equilibria are used in multi-agent control applications to model strategic interactions between agents that are coupled in the cost, dynamics, and constraints. We study the properties of open-loop GNE trajectories from a system-theoretic perspective. We show how strict dissipativity generates the turnpike phenomenon in GNE solutions. Moreover, we establish a converse turnpike result, i.e., the implication from turnpike to strict dissipativity. We derive conditions under which the steady-state GNE is the optimal operating point and, using a game value function, we give a local characterization of the geometry of storage functions. Finally, we design linear terminal penalties that ensure GNE open-loop trajectories converge to and remain at the steady-state GNE. These connections provide the foundation for future system-theoretic analysis of GNEs similar to those existing in optimal control.

<title>Co-Sight: Enhancing LLM-Based Agents via Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21557</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21557</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.21557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification (CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability. TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent, source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop, where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically, Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code is available at https://github.com/ZTE-AICloud/Co-Sight/tree/cosight2.0_benchmarks.

<title>ColorEcosystem: Powering Personalized, Standardized, and Trustworthy Agentic Service in massive-agent Ecosystem</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.21566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of (multimodal) large language model-based agents, the landscape of agentic service management has evolved from single-agent systems to multi-agent systems, and now to massive-agent ecosystems. Current massive-agent ecosystems face growing challenges, including impersonal service experiences, a lack of standardization, and untrustworthy behavior. To address these issues, we propose ColorEcosystem, a novel blueprint designed to enable personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service at scale. Concretely, ColorEcosystem consists of three key components: agent carrier, agent store, and agent audit. The agent carrier provides personalized service experiences by utilizing user-specific data and creating a digital twin, while the agent store serves as a centralized, standardized platform for managing diverse agentic services. The agent audit, based on the supervision of developer and user activities, ensures the integrity and credibility of both service providers and users. Through the analysis of challenges, transitional forms, and practical considerations, the ColorEcosystem is poised to power personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service across massive-agent ecosystems. Meanwhile, we have also implemented part of ColorEcosystem's functionality, and the relevant code is open-sourced at https://github.com/opas-lab/color-ecosystem.

<title>Doc-Researcher: A Unified System for Multimodal Document Parsing and Deep Research</title>

Abstract: Deep Research systems have revolutionized how LLMs solve complex questions through iterative reasoning and evidence gathering. However, current systems remain fundamentally constrained to textual web data, overlooking the vast knowledge embedded in multimodal documents Processing such documents demands sophisticated parsing to preserve visual semantics (figures, tables, charts, and equations), intelligent chunking to maintain structural coherence, and adaptive retrieval across modalities, which are capabilities absent in existing systems. In response, we present Doc-Researcher, a unified system that bridges this gap through three integrated components: (i) deep multimodal parsing that preserves layout structure and visual semantics while creating multi-granular representations from chunk to document level, (ii) systematic retrieval architecture supporting text-only, vision-only, and hybrid paradigms with dynamic granularity selection, and (iii) iterative multi-agent workflows that decompose complex queries, progressively accumulate evidence, and synthesize comprehensive answers across documents and modalities. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce M4DocBench, the first benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-hop, Multi-document, and Multi-turn deep research. Featuring 158 expert-annotated questions with complete evidence chains across 304 documents, M4DocBench tests capabilities that existing benchmarks cannot assess. Experiments demonstrate that Doc-Researcher achieves 50.6% accuracy, 3.4xbetter than state-of-the-art baselines, validating that effective document research requires not just better retrieval, but fundamentally deep parsing that preserve multimodal integrity and support iterative research. Our work establishes a new paradigm for conducting deep research on multimodal document collections.

Abstract: Achieving safe, reliable real-world robotic manipulation requires agents to evolve beyond vision and incorporate tactile sensing to overcome sensory deficits and reliance on idealised state information. Despite its potential, the efficacy of tactile sensing in reinforcement learning (RL) remains inconsistent. We address this by developing self-supervised learning (SSL) methodologies to more effectively harness tactile observations, focusing on a scalable setup of proprioception and sparse binary contacts. We empirically demonstrate that sparse binary tactile signals are critical for dexterity, particularly for interactions that proprioceptive control errors do not register, such as decoupled robot-object motions. Our agents achieve superhuman dexterity in complex contact tasks (ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation). Furthermore, we find that decoupling the SSL memory from the on-policy memory can improve performance. We release the Robot Tactile Olympiad (RoTO) benchmark to standardise and promote future research in tactile-based manipulation. Project page: https://elle-miller.github.io/tactile_rl

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.21614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$ and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance, matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/metauto-ai/HGM.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities, yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows, which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions, particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working, and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank, TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA, HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code and demo are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/DeepAgent.

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3) do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access; (4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders. Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

<title>A Knowledge-Graph Translation Layer for Mission-Aware Multi-Agent Path Planning in Spatiotemporal Dynamics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.21695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph (KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware ``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object detector.

Abstract: Developing embodied AI agents requires scalable training environments that balance content diversity with physics accuracy. World simulators provide such environments but face distinct limitations: video-based methods generate diverse content but lack real-time physics feedback for interactive learning, while physics-based engines provide accurate dynamics but face scalability limitations from costly manual asset creation. We present Seed3D 1.0, a foundation model that generates simulation-ready 3D assets from single images, addressing the scalability challenge while maintaining physics rigor. Unlike existing 3D generation models, our system produces assets with accurate geometry, well-aligned textures, and realistic physically-based materials. These assets can be directly integrated into physics engines with minimal configuration, enabling deployment in robotic manipulation and simulation training. Beyond individual objects, the system scales to complete scene generation through assembling objects into coherent environments. By enabling scalable simulation-ready content creation, Seed3D 1.0 provides a foundation for advancing physics-based world simulators. Seed3D 1.0 is now available on https://console.volcengine.com/ark/region:ark+cn-beijing/experience/vision?modelId=doubao-seed3d-1-0-250928&amp;tab=Gen3D

Abstract: We analyze a principal-agent procurement problem in which the principal (she) is unaware some of the marginal cost types of the agent (he). Communication arises naturally as some types of the agent may have an incentive to raise the principal's awareness (totally or partially) before a contract menu is offered. The resulting menu must not only reflect the principal's change in awareness, but also her learning about types from the agent's decision to raise her awareness in the first place. We capture this reasoning in a discrete concave model via a rationalizability procedure in which marginal beliefs over types are restricted to log-concavity, ``reverse'' Bayesianism, and mild assumptions of caution.
  We show that if the principal is ex ante only unaware of high-cost types, all of these types have an incentive raise her awareness of them -- otherwise, they would not be served. With three types, the two lower-cost types that the principal is initially aware of also want to raise her awareness of the high-cost type: Their quantities suffer no additional distortions and they both earn an extra information rent. Intuitively, the presence of an even higher cost type makes the original two look better. With more than three types, we show that this intuition may break down for types of whom the principal is initially aware of so that raising the principal's awareness could cease to be profitable for those types. When the principal is ex ante only unaware of more efficient (low-cost) types, then \textit{no type} raises her awareness, leaving her none the wiser.

Abstract: We consider a principal who wishes to screen an agent with \emph{discrete} types by offering a menu of \emph{discrete} quantities and \emph{discrete} transfers. We assume that the principal's valuation is discrete strictly concave and use a discrete first-order approach. We model the agent's cost types as non-integer, with integer types as a limit case. Our modeling of cost types allows us to replicate the typical constraint-simplification results and thus to emulate the well-treaded steps of screening under a continuum of contracts.
  We show that the solutions to the discrete F.O.C.s need not be unique \textit{even under discrete strict concavity}, but we also show that there cannot be more than two optimal contract quantities for each type, and that -- if there are two -- they must be adjacent. Moreover, we can only ensure weak monotonicity of the quantities \textit{even if virtual costs are strictly monotone}, unless we limit the ``degree of concavity'' of the principal's utility. Our discrete screening approach facilitates the use of rationalizability to solve the screening problem. We introduce a rationalizability notion featuring robustness with respect to an open set of beliefs over types called \textit{$\Delta$-O Rationalizability}, and show that the set of $\Delta$-O rationalizable menus coincides with the set of usual optimal contracts -- possibly augmented to include irrelevant contracts.

Abstract: We analyse financial stability and welfare impacts associated with the introduction of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in a macroeconomic agent-based model. The model considers firms, banks, and households interacting on labour, goods, credit, and interbank markets. Households move their liquidity from deposits to CBDC based on the perceived riskiness of their banks. We find that the introduction of CBDC exacerbates bank-runs and may lead to financial instability phenomena. The effect can be changed by introducing a limit on CBDC holdings. The adoption of CBDC has little effect on macroeconomic variables but the interest rate on loans to firms goes up and credit goes down in a limited way. CBDC leads to a redistribution of wealth from firms and banks to households with a higher bank default rate. CBDC may have negative welfare effects, but a bound on holding enables a welfare improvement.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent, AI-driven framework for fundamental investing that integrates macro indicators, industry-level and firm-specific information to construct optimized equity portfolios. The architecture comprises: (i) a Macro agent that dynamically screens and weights sectors based on evolving economic indicators and industry performance; (ii) four firm-level agents -- Fundamental, Technical, Report, and News -- that conduct in-depth analyses of individual firms to ensure both breadth and depth of coverage; (iii) a Portfolio agent that uses reinforcement learning to combine the agent outputs into a unified policy to generate the trading strategy; and (iv) a Risk Control agent that adjusts portfolio positions in response to market volatility. We evaluate the system on the constituents by the CSI 300 Index of China's A-share market and find that it consistently outperforms standard benchmarks and a state-of-the-art multi-agent trading system on risk-adjusted returns and drawdown control. Our core contribution is a hierarchical multi-agent design that links top-down macro screening with bottom-up fundamental analysis, offering a robust and extensible approach to factor-based portfolio construction.

Abstract: We study the combinatorial semi-bandit problem where an agent selects a subset of base arms and receives individual feedback. While this generalizes the classical multi-armed bandit and has broad applicability, its scalability is limited by the high cost of combinatorial optimization, requiring oracle queries at every round. To tackle this, we propose oracle-efficient frameworks that significantly reduce oracle calls while maintaining tight regret guarantees. For the worst-case linear reward setting, our algorithms achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret using only $O(\log\log T)$ oracle queries. We also propose covariance-adaptive algorithms that leverage noise structure for improved regret, and extend our approach to general (non-linear) rewards. Overall, our methods reduce oracle usage from linear to (doubly) logarithmic in time, with strong theoretical guarantees.

<title>Contribution of task-irrelevant stimuli to drift of neural representations</title>

Abstract: Biological and artificial learners are inherently exposed to a stream of data and experience throughout their lifetimes and must constantly adapt to, learn from, or selectively ignore the ongoing input. Recent findings reveal that, even when the performance remains stable, the underlying neural representations can change gradually over time, a phenomenon known as representational drift. Studying the different sources of data and noise that may contribute to drift is essential for understanding lifelong learning in neural systems. However, a systematic study of drift across architectures and learning rules, and the connection to task, are missing. Here, in an online learning setup, we characterize drift as a function of data distribution, and specifically show that the learning noise induced by task-irrelevant stimuli, which the agent learns to ignore in a given context, can create long-term drift in the representation of task-relevant stimuli. Using theory and simulations, we demonstrate this phenomenon both in Hebbian-based learning -- Oja's rule and Similarity Matching -- and in stochastic gradient descent applied to autoencoders and a supervised two-layer network. We consistently observe that the drift rate increases with the variance and the dimension of the data in the task-irrelevant subspace. We further show that this yields different qualitative predictions for the geometry and dimension-dependency of drift than those arising from Gaussian synaptic noise. Overall, our study links the structure of stimuli, task, and learning rule to representational drift and could pave the way for using drift as a signal for uncovering underlying computation in the brain.

Abstract: Lane-changing decisions, which are crucial for autonomous vehicle path planning, face practical challenges due to rule-based constraints and limited data. Deep reinforcement learning has become a major research focus due to its advantages in data acquisition and interpretability. However, current models often overlook collaboration, which affects not only impacts overall traffic efficiency but also hinders the vehicle's own normal driving in the long run. To address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes a method named Mix Q-learning for Lane Changing(MQLC) that integrates a hybrid value Q network, taking into account both collective and individual benefits for the greater good. At the collective level, our method coordinates the individual Q and global Q networks by utilizing global information. This enables agents to effectively balance their individual interests with the collective benefit. At the individual level, we integrated a deep learning-based intent recognition module into our observation and enhanced the decision network. These changes provide agents with richer decision information and more accurate feature extraction for improved lane-changing decisions. This strategy enables the multi-agent system to learn and formulate optimal decision-making strategies effectively. Our MQLC model, through extensive experimental results, impressively outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-agent decision-making methods, achieving significantly safer and faster lane-changing decisions. The code is available at https:github.com/pku-smart-city/source_code/tree/main/MQLC.

Abstract: Aligning robot behavior with human preferences is crucial for deploying embodied AI agents in human-centered environments. A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.

Abstract: Ring attractors, mathematical models inspired by neural circuit dynamics, provide a biologically plausible mechanism to improve learning speed and accuracy in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Serving as specialized brain-inspired structures that encode spatial information and uncertainty, ring attractors explicitly encode the action space, facilitate the organization of neural activity, and enable the distribution of spatial representations across the neural network in the context of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These structures also provide temporal filtering that stabilizes action selection during exploration, for example, by preserving the continuity between rotation angles in robotic control or adjacency between tactical moves in game-like environments. The application of ring attractors in the action selection process involves mapping actions to specific locations on the ring and decoding the selected action based on neural activity. We investigate the application of ring attractors by both building an exogenous model and integrating them as part of DRL agents. Our approach significantly improves state-of-the-art performance on the Atari 100k benchmark, achieving a 53% increase in performance over selected baselines.

Abstract: Automatically synthesizing dense rewards from natural language descriptions is a promising paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL), with applications to sparse reward problems, open-ended exploration, and hierarchical skill design. Recent works have made promising steps by exploiting the prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches suffer from important limitations: they are either not scalable to problems requiring billions of environment samples, due to requiring LLM annotations for each observation, or they require a diverse offline dataset, which may not exist or be impossible to collect. In this work, we address these limitations through a combination of algorithmic and systems-level contributions. We propose ONI, a distributed architecture that simultaneously learns an RL policy and an intrinsic reward function using LLM feedback. Our approach annotates the agent's collected experience via an asynchronous LLM server, which is then distilled into an intrinsic reward model. We explore a range of algorithmic choices for reward modeling with varying complexity, including hashing, classification, and ranking models. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of challenging tasks from the NetHack Learning Environment, while removing the need for large offline datasets required by prior work. We make our code available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/oni.

Abstract: Designing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenging because the size of the joint state and action spaces grows exponentially in the number of agents. These difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm $\texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ}$ ($\textbf{Subsample}$-$\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield-$\textbf{Q}$-learning) and a decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For any $k\leq n$, our algorithm learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$. We prove that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy on the order of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. In particular, this bound is independent of the number of agents $n$.

Abstract: User prompts for generative AI models are often underspecified, leading to a misalignment between the user intent and models' understanding. As a result, users commonly have to painstakingly refine their prompts. We study this alignment problem in text-to-image (T2I) generation and propose a prototype for proactive T2I agents equipped with an interface to (1) actively ask clarification questions when uncertain, and (2) present their uncertainty about user intent as an understandable and editable belief graph. We build simple prototypes for such agents and propose a new scalable and automated evaluation approach using two agents, one with a ground truth intent (an image) while the other tries to ask as few questions as possible to align with the ground truth. We experiment over three image-text datasets: ImageInWords (Garg et al., 2024), COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and DesignBench, a benchmark we curated with strong artistic and design elements. Experiments over the three datasets demonstrate the proposed T2I agents' ability to ask informative questions and elicit crucial information to achieve successful alignment with at least 2 times higher VQAScore (Lin et al., 2024) than the standard T2I generation. Moreover, we conducted human studies and observed that at least 90% of human subjects found these agents and their belief graphs helpful for their T2I workflow, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Code and DesignBench can be found at https://github.com/google-deepmind/proactive_t2i_agents.

Abstract: For continuing tasks, average cost Markov decision processes have well-documented value and can be solved using efficient algorithms. However, it explicitly assumes that the agent is risk-neutral. In this work, we extend risk-neutral algorithms to accommodate the more general class of dynamic risk measures. Specifically, we propose a relative value iteration (RVI) algorithm for planning and design two model-free Q-learning algorithms, namely a generic algorithm based on the multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) method, and an off-policy algorithm dedicated to utility-based shortfall risk measures. Both the RVI and MLMC-based Q-learning algorithms are proven to converge to optimality. Numerical experiments validate our analysis, confirm empirically the convergence of the off-policy algorithm, and demonstrate that our approach enables the identification of policies that are finely tuned to the intricate risk-awareness of the agent that they serve.

Abstract: Reward shaping in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for complex tasks remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often fail to find optimal solutions or cannot efficiently handle such tasks. We propose HYPRL, a specification-guided reinforcement learning framework that learns control policies w.r.t. hyperproperties expressed in HyperLTL. Hyperproperties constitute a powerful formalism for specifying objectives and constraints over sets of execution traces across agents. To learn policies that maximize the satisfaction of a HyperLTL formula $\phi$, we apply Skolemization to manage quantifier alternations and define quantitative robustness functions to shape rewards over execution traces of a Markov decision process with unknown transitions. A suitable RL algorithm is then used to learn policies that collectively maximize the expected reward and, consequently, increase the probability of satisfying $\phi$. We evaluate HYPRL on a diverse set of benchmarks, including safety-aware planning, Deep Sea Treasure, and the Post Correspondence Problem. We also compare with specification-driven baselines to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HYPRL.

Abstract: We introduce MLRC-Bench, a benchmark designed to quantify how effectively language agents can tackle challenging Machine Learning (ML) Research Competitions, with a focus on open research problems that demand novel methodologies. Unlike prior work, e.g., AI Scientist, which evaluates the end-to-end agentic pipeline by using LLM-as-a-judge, MLRC-Bench measures the key steps of proposing and implementing novel research methods and evaluates them with rigorous protocol and objective metrics. Our curated suite of 7 competition tasks reveals significant challenges for LLM agents. Even the best-performing tested agent (gemini-exp-1206 under MLAB) closes only 9.3% of the gap between baseline and top human participant scores. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a misalignment between the LLM-judged innovation and actual performance on cutting-edge ML research problems. MLRC-Bench is a dynamic benchmark, designed to grow with new ML competitions and encourage rigorous, objective evaluations of AI research capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal agents, which integrate a controller e.g., a vision language model) with external tools, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tackling complex multimodal tasks. Existing approaches for training these agents, both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, depend on extensive human-annotated task-answer pairs and tool trajectories. However, for complex multimodal tasks, such annotations are prohibitively expensive or impractical to obtain. In this paper, we propose an iterative tool usage exploration method for multimodal agents without any pre-collected data, namely SPORT, via step-wise preference optimization to refine the trajectories of tool usage. Our method enables multimodal agents to autonomously discover effective tool usage strategies through self-exploration and optimization, eliminating the bottleneck of human annotation. SPORT has four iterative components: task synthesis, step sampling, step verification, and preference tuning. We first synthesize multimodal tasks using language models. Then, we introduce a novel trajectory exploration scheme, where step sampling and step verification are executed alternately to solve synthesized tasks. In step sampling, the agent tries different tools and obtains corresponding results. In step verification, we employ a verifier to provide AI feedback to construct step-wise preference data. The data is subsequently used to update the controller for tool usage through preference tuning, producing a SPORT agent. By interacting with real environments, the SPORT agent gradually evolves into a more refined and capable system. Evaluation in the GTA and GAIA benchmarks shows that the SPORT agent achieves 6.41% and 3.64% improvements, underscoring the generalization and effectiveness introduced by our method.

Abstract: Formal reasoning and automated theorem proving constitute a challenging subfield of machine learning, in which machines are tasked with proving mathematical theorems using formal languages like Lean. A formal verification system can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost instantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with large language models (LLMs) remains a formidable task. The usual approach in the literature is to prompt the LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one of the generated proofs passes the verification system. In this work, we present APOLLO (Automated PrOof repair viaLLM and Lean cOllaboration), a modular, model-agnostic agentic framework that combines the strengths of the Lean compiler with an LLM's reasoning abilities to achieve better proof-generation results at a low token and sampling budgets. Apollo directs a fully automated process in which the LLM generates proofs for theorems, a set of agents analyze the proofs, fix the syntax errors, identify the mistakes in the proofs using Lean, isolate failing sub-lemmas, utilize automated solvers, and invoke an LLM on each remaining goal with a low top-K budget. The repaired sub-proofs are recombined and reverified, iterating up to a user-controlled maximum number of attempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we establish a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 84.9% among sub 8B-parameter models (as of August 2025) while keeping the sampling budget below one hundred. Moreover, Apollo raises the state-of-the-art accuracy for Goedel-Prover-SFT to 65.6% while cutting sample complexity from 25,600 to a few hundred. General-purpose models (o3-mini, o4-mini) jump from 3-7% to over 40% accuracy. Our results demonstrate that targeted, compiler-guided repair of LLM outputs yields dramatic gains in both efficiency and correctness, suggesting a general paradigm for scalable automated theorem proving.

Abstract: Despite the growing integration of retrieval-enabled AI agents into society, their safety and ethical behavior remain inadequately understood. In particular, the integration of LLMs and AI agents with external information sources and real-world environments raises critical questions about how they engage with and are influenced by these external data sources and interactive contexts. This study investigates how expanding retrieval access -- from no external sources to Wikipedia-based retrieval and open web search -- affects model reliability, bias propagation, and harmful content generation. Through extensive benchmarking of censored and uncensored LLMs and AI agents, our findings reveal a consistent degradation in refusal rates, bias sensitivity, and harmfulness safeguards as models gain broader access to external sources, culminating in a phenomenon we term safety degradation. Notably, retrieval-enabled agents built on aligned LLMs often behave more unsafely than uncensored models without retrieval. This effect persists even under strong retrieval accuracy and prompt-based mitigation, suggesting that the mere presence of retrieved content reshapes model behavior in structurally unsafe ways. These findings underscore the need for robust mitigation strategies to ensure fairness and reliability in retrieval-enabled and increasingly autonomous AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as intelligent agents capable of solving complex problems. However, effective planning in scenarios involving dependencies between API or tool calls-particularly in multi-turn conversations-remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce T1, a tool-augmented, multi-domain, multi-turn conversational dataset specifically designed to capture and manage inter-tool dependencies across diverse domains. T1 enables rigorous evaluation of agents' ability to coordinate tool use across nine distinct domains (4 single domain and 5 multi-domain) with the help of an integrated caching mechanism for both short- and long-term memory, while supporting dynamic replanning-such as deciding whether to recompute or reuse cached results. Beyond facilitating research on tool use and planning, T1 also serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of open-weight and proprietary large language models. We present results powered by T1-Agent, highlighting their ability to plan and reason in complex, tool-dependent scenarios.

Abstract: World models have recently attracted growing interest in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) due to their ability to improve sample efficiency for policy learning. However, accurately modeling environments in MARL is challenging due to the exponentially large joint action space and highly uncertain dynamics inherent in multi-agent systems. To address this, we reduce modeling complexity by shifting from jointly modeling the entire state-action transition dynamics to focusing on the state space alone at each timestep through sequential agent modeling. Specifically, our approach enables the model to progressively resolve uncertainty while capturing the structured dependencies among agents, providing a more accurate representation of how agents influence the state. Interestingly, this sequential revelation of agents' actions in a multi-agent system aligns with the reverse process in diffusion models--a class of powerful generative models known for their expressiveness and training stability compared to autoregressive or latent variable models. Leveraging this insight, we develop a flexible and robust world model for MARL using diffusion models. Our method, Diffusion-Inspired Multi-Agent world model (DIMA), achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple multi-agent control benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior world models in terms of final return and sample efficiency, including MAMuJoCo and Bi-DexHands. DIMA establishes a new paradigm for constructing multi-agent world models, advancing the frontier of MARL research. Codes are open-sourced at https://github.com/breez3young/DIMA.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities and achieved significant breakthroughs across various domains, leading to their widespread adoption in recent years. Building on this progress, we investigate their potential in the realm of local life services. In this study, we establish a comprehensive benchmark and systematically evaluate the performance of diverse LLMs across a wide range of tasks relevant to local life services. To further enhance their effectiveness, we explore two key approaches: model fine-tuning and agent-based workflows. Our findings reveal that even a relatively compact 7B model can attain performance levels comparable to a much larger 72B model, effectively balancing inference cost and model capability. This optimization greatly enhances the feasibility and efficiency of deploying LLMs in real-world online services, making them more practical and accessible for local life applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for legal argument generation, yet they pose significant risks of manipulation through hallucination and ungrounded persuasion, and often fail to utilize provided factual bases effectively or abstain when arguments are untenable. This paper introduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these challenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs specialized agents (factor analyst and argument polisher) in an iterative refinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant, rebuttal). We evaluate reflective multi-agent against single-agent, enhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using four diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e, Llama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: "arguable", "mismatched", and "non-arguable". Results demonstrate that the reflective multi-agent approach excels at successful abstention by preventing generation when arguments cannot be grounded, improves hallucination accuracy by reducing fabricated and misattributed factors and enhances factor utilization recall by better using the provided case facts. These findings suggest that structured reflection within a multi-agent framework offers a robust method for fostering ethical persuasion and mitigating manipulation in LLM-based legal argumentation systems.

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e. learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2) a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions required to combine these and other components for stable and sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three benchmarks, our approach SAILOR consistently out-performs state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data. Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by 5-10x still leaves a performance gap. We find that SAILOR can identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking.

Abstract: Simulating society with large language models (LLMs), we argue, requires more than generating plausible behavior; it demands cognitively grounded reasoning that is structured, revisable, and traceable. LLM-based agents are increasingly used to emulate individual and group behavior, primarily through prompting and supervised fine-tuning. Yet current simulations remain grounded in a behaviorist "demographics in, behavior out" paradigm, focusing on surface-level plausibility. As a result, they often lack internal coherence, causal reasoning, and belief traceability, making them unreliable for modeling how people reason, deliberate, and respond to interventions.
  To address this, we present a conceptual modeling paradigm, Generative Minds (GenMinds), which draws from cognitive science to support structured belief representations in generative agents. To evaluate such agents, we introduce the RECAP (REconstructing CAusal Paths) framework, a benchmark designed to assess reasoning fidelity via causal traceability, demographic grounding, and intervention consistency. These contributions advance a broader shift: from surface-level mimicry to generative agents that simulate thought, not just language, for social simulations.

Nonetheless, this interaction also introduces the risk of prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs from external sources can mislead the agent's behavior, potentially resulting in economic loss, privacy leakage, or system compromise. System-level defenses have recently shown promise by enforcing static or predefined policies, but they still face two key challenges: the ability to dynamically update security rules and the need for memory stream isolation. To address these challenges, we propose DRIFT, a Dynamic Rule-based Isolation Framework for Trustworthy agentic systems, which enforces both control- and data-level constraints. A Secure Planner first constructs a minimal function trajectory and a JSON-schema-style parameter checklist for each function node based on the user query. A Dynamic Validator then monitors deviations from the original plan, assessing whether changes comply with privilege limitations and the user's intent. Finally, an Injection Isolator detects and masks any instructions that may conflict with the user query from the memory stream to mitigate long-term risks. We empirically validate the effectiveness of DRIFT on the AgentDojo and ASB benchmark, demonstrating its strong security performance while maintaining high utility across diverse models, showcasing both its robustness and adaptability. The code is released at https://github.com/SaFoLab-WISC/DRIFT.

Abstract: By sharing information across multiple agents, collaborative perception helps autonomous vehicles mitigate occlusions and improve overall perception accuracy. While most previous work focus on vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure collaboration, with limited attention to aerial perspectives provided by UAVs, which uniquely offer dynamic, top-down views to alleviate occlusions and monitor large-scale interactive environments. A major reason for this is the lack of high-quality datasets for aerial-ground collaborative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present AGC-Drive, the first large-scale real-world dataset for Aerial-Ground Cooperative 3D perception. The data collection platform consists of two vehicles, each equipped with five cameras and one LiDAR sensor, and one UAV carrying a forward-facing camera and a LiDAR sensor, enabling comprehensive multi-view and multi-agent perception. Consisting of approximately 80K LiDAR frames and 360K images, the dataset covers 14 diverse real-world driving scenarios, including urban roundabouts, highway tunnels, and on/off ramps. Notably, 17% of the data comprises dynamic interaction events, including vehicle cut-ins, cut-outs, and frequent lane changes. AGC-Drive contains 350 scenes, each with approximately 100 frames and fully annotated 3D bounding boxes covering 13 object categories. We provide benchmarks for two 3D perception tasks: vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative perception and vehicle-to-UAV collaborative perception. Additionally, we release an open-source toolkit, including spatiotemporal alignment verification tools, multi-agent visualization systems, and collaborative annotation utilities. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/PercepX/AGC-Drive.

<title>How to Train Your LLM Web Agent: A Statistical Diagnosis</title>

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1) leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward manipulation tasks.

Abstract: We present Marcel, a lightweight and open-source conversational agent designed to support prospective students with admission-related inquiries. The system aims to provide fast and personalized responses, while reducing workload of university staff. We employ retrieval-augmented generation to ground answers in university resources and to provide users with verifiable, contextually relevant information. We introduce a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) retriever that maps user questions to knowledge-base entries, which allows administrators to steer retrieval, and improves over standard dense/hybrid retrieval strategies. The system is engineered for easy deployment in resource-constrained academic settings. We detail the system architecture, provide a technical evaluation of its components, and report insights from a real-world deployment.

Abstract: Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved, including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al., 2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.

Abstract: AI agents built on foundation models hold enormous promise. Current practice, however, focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also faces practical limitations from black-box autoregressive reasoning, where decisions unfold token by token without explicit simulation or counterfactual evaluation of outcomes. Humans, on the other hand, reason and plan by mentally simulating the consequences of actions within an internal model of the world -- a capability that supports flexible, goal-directed behavior across diverse contexts. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of an optimal agent in any general environment, SimuRA addresses the limitations of black-box autoregressive reasoning by incorporating the world model for planning via simulation. Our prototype world model is implemented using LLMs as a substrate, leveraging the natural language as a discrete, hierarchical representation grounded in concepts for planning, while remaining model-agnostic. On complex web-browsing tasks such as flight search, SimuRA improves the success rate from 0% to 32.2% compared to a representative open-web agent baseline. Across tasks, world-model-based planning achieves up to 124% higher task completion rates than a matched black-box autoregressive baseline, demonstrating the advantages of simulative reasoning. We release ReasonerAgent-Web, a web-browsing agent built on SimuRA, as an open-source research demo.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have opened up greater opportunities to enable fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to behave as more powerful interactive agents through improved instruction-following ability. However, understanding how this impacts confidence calibration for reliable model output has not been researched in full. In this work, we examine various open-sourced LLMs, identifying significant calibration degradation after instruction tuning in each. Seeking a practical solution, we look towards label smoothing, which has been shown as an effective method to regularize for overconfident predictions but has yet to be widely adopted in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs. We first provide insight as to why label smoothing is sufficient to maintain calibration throughout the SFT process. However, settings remain where the effectiveness of smoothing is severely diminished, in particular the case of large vocabulary LLMs (LV-LLMs). We posit the cause to stem from the ability to become over-confident, which has a direct relationship with the hidden size and vocabulary size, and justify this theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we address an outstanding issue regarding the memory footprint of the cross-entropy loss computation in the label smoothed loss setting, designing a customized kernel to dramatically reduce memory consumption without sacrificing speed or performance in comparison to existing solutions for non-smoothed losses.

Abstract: During spontaneous conversations, speakers collaborate on novel referring expressions, which they can then re-use in subsequent conversations. Understanding such referring expressions is an important ability for an embodied agent, so that it can carry out tasks in the real world. This requires integrating and understanding language, vision, and conversational interaction. We study the capabilities of seven state-of-the-art Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) as overhearers to a corpus of spontaneous conversations between pairs of human discourse participants engaged in a collaborative object-matching task. We find that such a task remains challenging for current LVLMs and they all fail to show a consistent performance improvement as they overhear more conversations from the same discourse participants repeating the same task for multiple rounds. We release our corpus and code for reproducibility and to facilitate future research.

Abstract: In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists: their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL), a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework: (1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named BTL-UI, which demonstrates competitive performance across both static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.

Abstract: Building general-purpose graphical user interface (GUI) agents has become increasingly promising with the progress in vision language models. However, developing effective mobile GUI agents with reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to the heavy-tailed distribution of task difficulty and the inefficiency of large-scale environment sampling. We present an online agentic reinforcement learning framework MobileRL to enhance GUI agents in mobile environments. Its core component is the Difficulty-ADAptive GRPO (ADAGRPO) algorithm. In ADAGRPO, we design difficulty-adaptive positive replay and failure curriculum filtering to adapt the model to different task difficulties. We introduce the shortest-path reward adjustment strategy to reshape rewards concerning the task length in multi-turn agentic tasks. Those strategies jointly stabilize RL training, improve sample efficiency, and generate strong performance across diverse mobile apps and tasks. We apply MOBILERL to two open models (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and GLM-4.1V-9B-Base). The resultant MOBILERL-9B model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of success rates on both AndroidWorld (80.2%) and AndroidLab (53.6%). The MOBILERL framework is open-sourced at: https://github.com/THUDM/MobileRL.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE) framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2) problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. In addition, our framework can successfully adapt to and improve reasoning datasets represented by AIME-2024. This work marks a paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic, self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging runway for agent development

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of 102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of complex research code. RECODE-H establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, feedback-driven LLM agents in scientific research implementation

Abstract: In models of opinion dynamics, agents interact with each other and can change their opinions as a result of those interactions. One type of opinion model is a bounded-confidence model (BCM), in which opinions take continuous values and interacting agents compromise their opinions with each other if their opinions are sufficiently similar. In studies of BCMs, researchers typically assume that interactions between agents occur at deterministic times. This assumption neglects an inherent element of randomness in social interactions, and it is desirable to account for it. In this paper, we study BCMs on networks and allow agents to interact at random times. To incorporate random-time interactions, we use renewal processes to determine social-interaction event times, which can follow arbitrary interevent-time distributions (ITDs). We establish connections between these random-time-interaction BCMs and deterministic-time-interaction BCMs. We analyze the quantitative impact of ITDs on the transient dynamics of BCMs and derive approximate master equations for the time-dependent expectations of the BCM dynamics. We find that BCMs with Markovian ITDs have consistent statistical properties (in particular, they have the same expected time-dependent opinions) when the ITDs have the same mean but that the statistical properties of BCMs with non-Markovian ITDs depend on the type of ITD even when the ITDs have the same mean. Additionally, we numerically examine the transient and steady-state dynamics of our models with various ITDs on different networks and compare their expected order-parameter values and expected convergence times.

Abstract: Autonomy is a hallmark of animal intelligence, enabling adaptive and intelligent behavior in complex environments without relying on external reward or task structure. Existing reinforcement learning approaches to exploration in reward-free environments, including a class of methods known as model-based intrinsic motivation, exhibit inconsistent exploration patterns and do not converge to an exploratory policy, thus failing to capture robust autonomous behaviors observed in animals. Moreover, systems neuroscience has largely overlooked the neural basis of autonomy, focusing instead on experimental paradigms where animals are motivated by external reward rather than engaging in ethological, naturalistic and task-independent behavior. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel model-based intrinsic drive explicitly designed after the principles of autonomous exploration in animals. Our method (3M-Progress) achieves animal-like exploration by tracking divergence between an online world model and a fixed prior learned from an ecological niche. To the best of our knowledge, we introduce the first autonomous embodied agent that predicts brain data entirely from self-supervised optimization of an intrinsic goal -- without any behavioral or neural training data -- demonstrating that 3M-Progress agents capture the explainable variance in behavioral patterns and whole-brain neural-glial dynamics recorded from autonomously behaving larval zebrafish, thereby providing the first goal-driven, population-level model of neural-glial computation. Our findings establish a computational framework connecting model-based intrinsic motivation to naturalistic behavior, providing a foundation for building artificial agents with animal-like autonomy.

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval, report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i) employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\% and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into various sensitive applications, prompt injection, the use of prompting to induce harmful behaviors from LLMs, poses an ever increasing risk. Prompt injection attacks can cause LLMs to leak sensitive data, spread misinformation, and exhibit harmful behaviors. To defend against these attacks, we propose CourtGuard, a locally-runnable, multiagent prompt injection classifier. In it, prompts are evaluated in a court-like multiagent LLM system, where a "defense attorney" model argues the prompt is benign, a "prosecution attorney" model argues the prompt is a prompt injection, and a "judge" model gives the final classification. CourtGuard has a lower false positive rate than the Direct Detector, an LLM as-a-judge. However, CourtGuard is generally a worse prompt injection detector. Nevertheless, this lower false positive rate highlights the importance of considering both adversarial and benign scenarios for the classification of a prompt. Additionally, the relative performance of CourtGuard in comparison to other prompt injection classifiers advances the use of multiagent systems as a defense against prompt injection attacks. The implementations of CourtGuard and the Direct Detector with full prompts for Gemma-3-12b-it, Llama-3.3-8B, and Phi-4-mini-instruct are available at https://github.com/isaacwu2000/CourtGuard.

<title>A Specification's Realm: Characterizing the Knowledge Required for Executing a Given Algorithm Specification</title>

Abstract: An algorithm specification in natural language or pseudocode is expected to be clear and explicit enough to enable mechanical execution. In this position paper we contribute an initial characterization of the knowledge that an executing agent, human or machine, should possess in order to be able to carry out the instructions of a given algorithm specification as a stand-alone entity, independent of any system implementation. We argue that, for that algorithm specification, such prerequisite knowledge, whether unique or shared with other specifications, can be summarized in a document of practical size. We term this document the realm of the algorithm specification. The generation of such a realm is itself a systematic analytical process, significant parts of which can be automated with the help of large language models and the reuse of existing documents. The algorithm-specification's realm would consist of specification language syntax and semantics, domain knowledge restricted to the referenced entities, inter-entity relationships, relevant underlying cause-and-effect rules, and detailed instructions and means for carrying out certain operations. Such characterization of the realm can contribute to methodological implementation of the algorithm specification in diverse systems and to its formalization for mechanical verification. The paper also touches upon the question of assessing execution faithfulness, which is distinct from correctness: in the absence of a reference interpretation of natural language or pseudocode specification with a given vocabulary, how can we determine if an observed agent's execution indeed complies with the input specification.

Abstract: In recent years, blockchain has experienced widespread adoption across various industries, becoming integral to numerous enterprise applications. Concurrently, the rise of generative AI and LLMs has transformed human-computer interactions, offering advanced capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. The introduction of the MCP has further enhanced AI integration by standardizing communication between AI systems and external data sources. Despite these advancements, there is still no standardized method for seamlessly integrating LLM applications and blockchain. To address this concern, we propose "MCC: Model Context Contracts" a novel framework that enables LLMs to interact directly with blockchain smart contracts through MCP-like protocol. This integration allows AI agents to invoke blockchain smart contracts, facilitating more dynamic and context-aware interactions between users and blockchain networks. Essentially, it empowers users to interact with blockchain systems and perform transactions using queries in natural language. Within this proposed architecture, blockchain smart contracts can function as intelligent agents capable of recognizing user input in natural language and executing the corresponding transactions. To ensure that the LLM accurately interprets natural language inputs and maps them to the appropriate MCP functions, the LLM was fine-tuned using a custom dataset comprising user inputs paired with their corresponding MCP server functions. This fine-tuning process significantly improved the platform's performance and accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of MCC, we have developed an end-to-end prototype implemented on the Rahasak blockchain with the fine-tuned Llama-4 LLM. To the best of our knowledge, this research represents the first approach to using the concept of Model Context Protocol to integrate LLMs with blockchain.

Abstract: Automated code generation driven by Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs) has enhanced development efficiency, yet generating complex application-level software code remains challenging. Multi-agent frameworks show potential, but existing methods perform inadequately in large-scale application-level software code generation, failing to ensure reasonable orga- nizational structures of project code and making it difficult to maintain the code generation process. To address this, this paper envisions a Knowledge-Guided Application-Level Code Generation framework named KGACG, which aims to trans- form software requirements specification and architectural design document into executable code through a collaborative closed- loop of the Code Organization & Planning Agent (COPA), Coding Agent (CA), and Testing Agent (TA), combined with a feedback mechanism. We demonstrate the collaborative process of the agents in KGACG in a Java Tank Battle game case study while facing challenges. KGACG is dedicated to advancing the automation of application-level software development.

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training. This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static, individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research (OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation. Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts. In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

<title>Learning from Supervision with Semantic and Episodic Memory: A Reflective Approach to Agent Adaptation</title>

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly, inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a 24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models, particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and interpretable LLM agents.

Abstract: High quality bugs are key to training the next generation of language model based software engineering (SWE) agents. We introduce a novel method for synthetic generation of difficult and diverse bugs. Our method instructs SWE Agents to introduce a feature into the codebase whereby they may unintentionally break tests, resulting in bugs. Prior approaches often induce an out-of-distribution effect by generating bugs intentionally (e.g. by introducing local perturbation to existing code), which does not reflect realistic development processes. We perform qualitative analysis to demonstrate that our approach for generating bugs more closely reflects the patterns found in human-authored edits. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our bugs provide more efficient training data for supervised fine-tuning, outperforming other bug datasets by 2% with half the training data (1.2k vs. 3k bugs). We train on our newly generated bugs in addition to existing bug datasets to get FrogBoss a state-of-the-art 32B parameter model on SWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 54.6% and FrogMini a state-of-the-art 14B model on SWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 45.3% on SWE-bench Verified averaged over three seeds.

Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments remains an open challenge, as prior systems rely on environment-specific interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long task horizons. Our system achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2 exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal cost-efficiency.

<title>Robust Reinforcement Learning in Finance: Modeling Market Impact with Elliptic Uncertainty Sets</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19950</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.19950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices. However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets, enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes, offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

Abstract: Large Language Models are being used in conversational agents that simulate human conversations and generate social studies data. While concerns about the models' biases have been raised and discussed in the literature, much about the data generated is still unknown. In this study we explore the statistical representation of social values across four countries (UK, Argentina, USA and China) for six LLMs, with equal representation for open and closed weights. By comparing machine-generated outputs with actual human survey data, we assess whether algorithmic biases in LLMs outweigh the biases inherent in real- world sampling, including demographic and response biases. Our findings suggest that, despite the logistical and financial constraints of human surveys, even a small, skewed sample of real respondents may provide more reliable insights than synthetic data produced by LLMs. These results highlight the limitations of using AI-generated text for social research and emphasize the continued importance of empirical human data collection.

<title>A Tutorial on Cognitive Biases in Agentic AI-Driven 6G Autonomous Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.19973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The path to higher network autonomy in 6G lies beyond the mere optimization of key performance indicators (KPIs). While KPIs have enabled automation gains under TM Forum Levels 1--3, they remain numerical abstractions that act only as proxies for the real essence of communication networks: seamless connectivity, fairness, adaptability, and resilience. True autonomy requires perceiving and reasoning over the network environment as it is. Such progress can be achieved through \emph{agentic AI}, where large language model (LLM)-powered agents perceive multimodal telemetry, reason with memory, negotiate across domains, and act via APIs to achieve multi-objective goals. However, deploying such agents introduces the challenge of cognitive biases inherited from human design, which can distort reasoning, negotiation, tool use, and actuation. Between neuroscience and AI, this paper provides a tutorial on a selection of well-known biases, including their taxonomy, definition, mathematical formulation, emergence in telecom systems and the commonly impacted agentic components. The tutorial also presents various mitigation strategies tailored to each type of bias. The article finally provides two practical use-cases, which tackle the emergence, impact and mitigation gain of some famous biases in 6G inter-slice and cross-domain management. In particular, anchor randomization, temporal decay and inflection bonus techniques are introduced to specifically address anchoring, temporal and confirmation biases. This avoids that agents stick to the initial high resource allocation proposal or decisions that are recent and/or confirming a prior hypothesis. By grounding decisions in a richer and fairer set of past experiences, the quality and bravery of the agentic agreements in the second use-case, for instance, are leading to $\times 5$ lower latency and around $40\%$ higher energy saving.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.19995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teamwork in workspace for complex tasks requires diverse communication strategies, but current multi-agent LLM systems lack systematic frameworks for task oriented communication. We introduce Communication to Completion (C2C), a scalable framework that addresses this gap through two key innovations: (1) the Alignment Factor (AF), a novel metric quantifying agent task alignment that directly impacts work efficiency, and (2) a Sequential Action Framework that integrates stepwise execution with intelligent communication decisions. C2C enables agents to make cost aware communication choices, dynamically improving task understanding through targeted interactions. We evaluated C2C on realistic coding workflows across three complexity tiers and team sizes from 5 to 17 agents, comparing against no communication and fixed steps baselines. The results show that C2C reduces the task completion time by about 40% with acceptable communication costs. The framework completes all tasks successfully in standard configurations and maintains effectiveness at scale. C2C establishes both a theoretical foundation for measuring communication effectiveness in multi-agent systems and a practical framework for complex collaborative tasks.

Abstract: We study the problem of jointly selecting sensing agents and synthesizing decentralized active perception policies for the chosen subset of agents within a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) framework. Our approach employs a two-layer optimization structure. In the inner layer, we introduce information-theoretic metrics, defined by the mutual information between the unknown trajectories or some hidden property in the environment and the collective partial observations in the multi-agent system, as a unified objective for active perception problems. We employ various optimization methods to obtain optimal sensor policies that maximize mutual information for distinct active perception tasks. In the outer layer, we prove that under certain conditions, the information-theoretic objectives are monotone and submodular with respect to the subset of observations collected from multiple agents. We then exploit this property to design an IMAS$^2$ (Information-theoretic Multi-Agent Selection and Sensing) algorithm for joint sensing agent selection and sensing policy synthesis. However, since the policy search space is infinite, we adapt the classical Nemhauser-Wolsey argument to prove that the proposed IMAS$^2$ algorithm can provide a tight $(1 - 1/e)$-guarantee on the performance. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a multi-agent cooperative perception in a grid-world environment.

<title>SALT: Step-level Advantage Assignment for Long-horizon Agents via Trajectory Graph</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse, outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment, derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop, ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy. LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of 8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI insights in high-stakes finance.

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection, and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop, dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial forensics.

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly, with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs (30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2, Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable, marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous finite-sample theory.

arXiv:2510.20168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and \textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore, our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust information-seeking agents.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table understanding.

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters. Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM) agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends (correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement, highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

<title>Automated Cloud Infrastructure-as-Code Reconciliation with AI Agents</title>

Abstract: Cloud infrastructure is managed through a mix of interfaces -- traditionally, cloud consoles, command-line interfaces (CLI), and SDKs are the tools of choice. Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have quickly gained popularity. Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the infrastructure in a "source-of-truth" configuration. They are capable of automatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating, or destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment with the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs, or SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure drift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may undo valid updates or trigger errors.
  We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates out-of-band changes back into the IaC program. Our key insight is that infrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the lowest layer for cloud management operations. NSync gleans insights from API traces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update the IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic architecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API sequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and continually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past reconciliations. We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting realistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation performance. Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372 drift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of accuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\times$ improvement).

Abstract: The ability to model interactions among agents is crucial for effective coordination and understanding their cooperation mechanisms in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, previous efforts to model high-order interactions have been primarily hindered by the combinatorial explosion or the opaque nature of their black-box network structures. In this paper, we propose a novel value decomposition framework, called Continued Fraction Q-Learning (QCoFr), which can flexibly capture arbitrary-order agent interactions with only linear complexity $\mathcal{O}\left({n}\right)$ in the number of agents, thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion when modeling rich cooperation. Furthermore, we introduce the variational information bottleneck to extract latent information for estimating credits. This latent information helps agents filter out noisy interactions, thereby significantly enhancing both cooperation and interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QCoFr not only consistently achieves better performance but also provides interpretability that aligns with our theoretical analysis.

Abstract: This article presents early findings from designing, deploying and evaluating an AI-based educational agent deployed as the primary instructor in a graduate-level Cloud Computing course at IISc. We detail the design of a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Instructor Agent, and introduce a pedagogical framework that integrates the Instructor Agent into the course workflow for actively interacting with the students for content delivery, supplemented by the human instructor to offer the course structure and undertake question--answer sessions. We also propose an analytical framework that evaluates the Agent--Student interaction transcripts using interpretable engagement metrics of topic coverage, topic depth and turn-level elaboration. We report early experiences on how students interact with the Agent to explore concepts, clarify doubts and sustain inquiry-driven dialogue during live classroom sessions. We also report preliminary analysis on our evaluation metrics applied across two successive instructional modules that reveals patterns of engagement evolution, transitioning from broad conceptual exploration to deeper, focused inquiry. These demonstrate how structured integration of conversational AI agents can foster reflective learning, offer a reproducible methodology for studying engagement in authentic classroom settings, and support scalable, high-quality higher education.

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on. We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these. The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the associated fluents.

Abstract: One key aspect of spatially aware robots is the ability to "find their bearings", ie. to correctly situate themselves in previously seen spaces. In this work, we focus on this particular scenario of continuous robotics operations, where information observed before an actual episode start is exploited to optimize efficiency. We introduce a new model, Kinaema, and agent, capable of integrating a stream of visual observations while moving in a potentially large scene, and upon request, processing a query image and predicting the relative position of the shown space with respect to its current position. Our model does not explicitly store an observation history, therefore does not have hard constraints on context length. It maintains an implicit latent memory, which is updated by a transformer in a recurrent way, compressing the history of sensor readings into a compact representation. We evaluate the impact of this model in a new downstream task we call "Mem-Nav". We show that our large-capacity recurrent model maintains a useful representation of the scene, navigates to goals observed before the actual episode start, and is computationally efficient, in particular compared to classical transformers with attention over an observation history.

<title>ImpossibleBench: Measuring LLMs' Propensity of Exploiting Test Cases</title>

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench, a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks, where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors, revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3) developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building more robust and reliable LLM systems.
  Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/safety-research/impossiblebench.

<title>From Generation to Attribution: Music AI Agent Architectures for the Post-Streaming Era</title>

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping music creation, but its rapid growth exposes structural gaps in attribution, rights management, and economic models. Unlike past media shifts, from live performance to recordings, downloads, and streaming, AI transforms the entire lifecycle of music, collapsing boundaries between creation, distribution, and monetization. However, existing streaming systems, with opaque and concentrated royalty flows, are ill-equipped to handle the scale and complexity of AI-driven production. We propose a content-based Music AI Agent architecture that embeds attribution directly into the creative workflow through block-level retrieval and agentic orchestration. Designed for iterative, session-based interaction, the system organizes music into granular components (Blocks) stored in BlockDB; each use triggers an Attribution Layer event for transparent provenance and real-time settlement. This framework reframes AI from a generative tool into infrastructure for a Fair AI Media Platform. By enabling fine-grained attribution, equitable compensation, and participatory engagement, it points toward a post-streaming paradigm where music functions not as a static catalog but as a collaborative and adaptive ecosystem.

<title>UI-Ins: Enhancing GUI Grounding with Multi-Perspective Instruction-as-Reasoning</title>

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

<title>Multi-Step Reasoning for Embodied Question Answering via Tool Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline, we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by 9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see https://tooleqa.github.io.

<title>GhostEI-Bench: Do Mobile Agents Resilience to Environmental Injection in Dynamic On-Device Environments?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20333</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.20333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents to navigate mobile graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Operating in dynamic on-device ecosystems, which include notifications, pop-ups, and inter-app interactions, exposes them to a unique and underexplored threat vector: environmental injection. Unlike prompt-based attacks that manipulate textual instructions, environmental injection corrupts an agent's visual perception by inserting adversarial UI elements (for example, deceptive overlays or spoofed notifications) directly into the GUI. This bypasses textual safeguards and can derail execution, causing privacy leakage, financial loss, or irreversible device compromise. To systematically evaluate this threat, we introduce GhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark for assessing mobile agents under environmental injection attacks within dynamic, executable environments. Moving beyond static image-based assessments, GhostEI-Bench injects adversarial events into realistic application workflows inside fully operational Android emulators and evaluates performance across critical risk scenarios. We further propose a judge-LLM protocol that conducts fine-grained failure analysis by reviewing the agent's action trajectory alongside the corresponding screenshot sequence, pinpointing failure in perception, recognition, or reasoning. Comprehensive experiments on state-of-the-art agents reveal pronounced vulnerability to deceptive environmental cues: current models systematically fail to perceive and reason about manipulated UIs. GhostEI-Bench provides a framework for quantifying and mitigating this emerging threat, paving the way toward more robust and secure embodied agents.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure, normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions, including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

<title>Balancing Specialization and Centralization: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Benchmark for Sequential Industrial Control</title>

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on centralization versus specialization.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.20409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As autonomous agents, from self-driving cars to virtual assistants, become increasingly present in everyday life, safe and effective collaboration depends on human understanding of agents' intentions. Current intent communication approaches are often rigid, agent-specific, and narrowly scoped, limiting their adaptability across tasks, environments, and user preferences. A key gap remains: existing models of what to communicate are rarely linked to systematic choices of how and when to communicate, preventing the development of generalizable, multi-modal strategies. In this paper, we introduce a multidimensional design space for intent communication structured along three dimensions: Transparency (what is communicated), Abstraction (when), and Modality (how). We apply this design space to three distinct human-agent collaboration scenarios: (a) bystander interaction, (b) cooperative tasks, and (c) shared control, demonstrating its capacity to generate adaptable, scalable, and cross-domain communication strategies. By bridging the gap between intent content and communication implementation, our design space provides a foundation for designing safer, more intuitive, and more transferable agent-human interactions.

Abstract: Dual quaternions have gained significant attention due to their wide applications in areas such as multi-agent formation control, 3D motion modeling, and robotics. A fundamental aspect in dual quaternion research involves the projection onto unit dual quaternion sets. In this paper, we systematically study such projections under the $2^R$-norm, which is commonly used in practical applications. We identify several distinct cases based on the relationship between the standard and dual parts in vector form, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through numerical experiments.

Abstract: There has recently been a major advance with respect to how information fusion is performed. Information fusion has gone from being conceived as a purely hierarchical procedure, as is the case of traditional military applications, to now being regarded collaboratively, as holonic fusion, which is better suited for civil applications and edge organizations. The above paradigm shift is being boosted as information fusion gains ground in different non-military areas, and human-computer and machine-machine communications, where holarchies, which are more flexible structures than ordinary, static hierarchies, become more widespread. This paper focuses on showing how holonic structures tend to be generated when there are constraints on resources (energy, available messages, time, etc.) for interactions based on a set of fully intercommunicating elements (peers) whose components fuse information as a means of optimizing the impact of vagueness and uncertainty present message exchanges. Holon formation is studied generically based on a multiagent system model, and an example of its possible operation is shown. Holonic structures have a series of advantages, such as adaptability, to sudden changes in the environment or its composition, are somewhat autonomous and are capable of cooperating in order to achieve a common goal. This can be useful when the shortage of resources prevents communications or when the system components start to fail.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA (text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1 gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and (3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency and auditability.

Abstract: AI-based sensing at wireless edge devices has the potential to significantly enhance Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, particularly for vision and perception tasks such as in autonomous driving and environmental monitoring. AI systems rely both on efficient model learning and inference. In the inference phase, features extracted from sensing data are utilized for prediction tasks (e.g., classification or regression). In edge networks, sensors and model servers are often not co-located, which requires communication of features. As sensitive personal data can be reconstructed by an adversary, transformation of the features are required to reduce the risk of privacy violations. While differential privacy mechanisms provide a means of protecting finite datasets, protection of individual features has not been addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving AI-based sensing, where devices apply transformations of extracted features before transmission to a model server.

<title>A Unified Framework for Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL, which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations, which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

Abstract: Existing defence mechanisms have demonstrated significant effectiveness in mitigating rule-based Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, leveraging predefined signatures and static heuristics to identify and block malicious traffic. However, the emergence of AI-driven techniques presents new challenges to SDN security, potentially compromising the efficacy of existing defence mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce~AdaDoS, an adaptive attack model that disrupt network operations while evading detection by existing DoS-based detectors through adversarial reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, AdaDoS models the problem as a competitive game between an attacker, whose goal is to obstruct network traffic without being detected, and a detector, which aims to identify malicious traffic. AdaDoS can solve this game by dynamically adjusting its attack strategy based on feedback from the SDN and the detector. Additionally, recognising that attackers typically have less information than defenders, AdaDoS formulates the DoS-like attack as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP), with the attacker having access only to delay information between attacker and victim nodes. We address this challenge with a novel reciprocal learning module, where the student agent, with limited observations, enhances its performance by learning from the teacher agent, who has full observational capabilities in the SDN environment. AdaDoS represents the first application of RL to develop DoS-like attack sequences, capable of adaptively evading both machine learning-based and rule-based DoS-like attack detectors.

<title>Beyond Retrieval-Ranking: A Multi-Agent Cognitive Decision Framework for E-Commerce Search</title>

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction, particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model (GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency. For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks, highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data, model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at https://zterobot.github.io/EmbodiedBrain.github.io.

<title>Open-o3 Video: Grounded Video Reasoning with Explicit Spatio-Temporal Evidence</title>

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3 have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers, allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets, STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision. On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance, raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and improving answer reliability.

Abstract: Meritocratic systems, from admissions to hiring, aim to impartially reward skill and effort. Yet persistent disparities across race, gender, and class challenge this ideal. Some attribute these gaps to structural inequality; others to individual choice. We develop a game-theoretic model in which candidates from different socioeconomic groups differ in their perceived post-selection value--shaped by social context and, increasingly, by AI-powered tools offering personalized career or salary guidance. Each candidate strategically chooses effort, balancing its cost against expected reward; effort translates into observable merit, and selection is based solely on merit. We characterize the unique Nash equilibrium in the large-agent limit and derive explicit formulas showing how valuation disparities and institutional selectivity jointly determine effort, representation, social welfare, and utility. We further propose a cost-sensitive optimization framework that quantifies how modifying selectivity or perceived value can reduce disparities without compromising institutional goals. Our analysis reveals a perception-driven bias: when perceptions of post-selection value differ across groups, these differences translate into rational differences in effort, propagating disparities backward through otherwise "fair" selection processes. While the model is static, it captures one stage of a broader feedback cycle linking perceptions, incentives, and outcome--bridging rational-choice and structural explanations of inequality by showing how techno-social environments shape individual incentives in meritocratic systems.

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML) models in perceptual and cognitive tasks, frameworks integrating ML within rational agent architectures are gaining traction. Yet, the landscape remains fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI paradigm as a reference. Our analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature on rational agents enhanced by ML, and identifies key research opportunities and open challenges for designing effective rational ML agents.

Abstract: Embodied agents are expected to perform object navigation in dynamic, open-world environments. However, existing approaches typically rely on static trajectories and a fixed set of object categories during training, overlooking the real-world requirement for continual adaptation to evolving scenarios. To facilitate related studies, we introduce the continual object navigation benchmark, which requires agents to acquire navigation skills for new object categories while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge. To tackle this challenge, we propose C-Nav, a continual visual navigation framework that integrates two key innovations: (1) A dual-path anti-forgetting mechanism, which comprises feature distillation that aligns multi-modal inputs into a consistent representation space to ensure representation consistency, and feature replay that retains temporal features within the action decoder to ensure policy consistency. (2) An adaptive sampling strategy that selects diverse and informative experiences, thereby reducing redundancy and minimizing memory overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple model architectures demonstrate that C-Nav consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance even compared to baselines with full trajectory retention, while significantly lowering memory requirements. The code will be publicly available at https://bigtree765.github.io/C-Nav-project.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation suite to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy, ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence. While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of compute or data scale.

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that necessitates novel therapeutic innovations due to its gradual progression and the onset of various metabolic complications. Research indicates that Ficus religiosa is a conventional medicinal plant that generates bioactive phytochemicals with potential antidiabetic properties. The investigation employs ecosystem-based computational approaches utilizing artificial intelligence to investigate and evaluate compounds derived from Ficus religiosa that exhibit antidiabetic properties. A comprehensive computational procedure incorporated machine learning methodologies, molecular docking techniques, and ADMET prediction systems to assess phytochemical efficacy against the significant antidiabetic enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). DeepBindGCN and the AutoDock software facilitated the investigation of binding interactions via deep learning technology. Flavonoids and alkaloids have emerged as attractive phytochemicals due to their strong binding interactions and advantageous pharmacological effects, as indicated by the study. The introduction of AI accelerated screening procedures and enhanced accuracy rates, demonstrating its efficacy in researching plant-based antidiabetic agents. The scientific foundation now facilitates future experimental validation of natural product therapies tailored for diabetic management.

<title>Simultaneously Solving Infinitely Many LQ Mean Field Games In Hilbert Spaces: The Power of Neural Operators</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Traditional mean-field game (MFG) solvers operate on an instance-by-instance basis, which becomes infeasible when many related problems must be solved (e.g., for seeking a robust description of the solution under perturbations of the dynamics or utilities, or in settings involving continuum-parameterized agents.). We overcome this by training neural operators (NOs) to learn the rules-to-equilibrium map from the problem data (``rules'': dynamics and cost functionals) of LQ MFGs defined on separable Hilbert spaces to the corresponding equilibrium strategy. Our main result is a statistical guarantee: an NO trained on a small number of randomly sampled rules reliably solves unseen LQ MFG variants, even in infinite-dimensional settings. The number of NO parameters needed remains controlled under appropriate rule sampling during training.
  Our guarantee follows from three results: (i) local-Lipschitz estimates for the highly nonlinear rules-to-equilibrium map; (ii) a universal approximation theorem using NOs with a prespecified Lipschitz regularity (unlike traditional NO results where the NO's Lipschitz constant can diverge as the approximation error vanishes); and (iii) new sample-complexity bounds for $L$-Lipschitz learners in infinite dimensions, directly applicable as the Lipschitz constants of our approximating NOs are controlled in (ii).

Abstract: Since the advent of various pre-trained large language models, extracting structured knowledge from scientific text has experienced a revolutionary change compared with traditional machine learning or natural language processing techniques. Despite these advances, accessible automated tools that allow users to construct, validate, and visualise datasets from scientific literature extraction remain scarce. We therefore developed ComProScanner, an autonomous multi-agent platform that facilitates the extraction, validation, classification, and visualisation of machine-readable chemical compositions and properties, integrated with synthesis data from journal articles for comprehensive database creation. We evaluated our framework using 100 journal articles against 10 different LLMs, including both open-source and proprietary models, to extract highly complex compositions associated with ceramic piezoelectric materials and corresponding piezoelectric strain coefficients (d33), motivated by the lack of a large dataset for such materials. DeepSeek-V3-0324 outperformed all models with a significant overall accuracy of 0.82. This framework provides a simple, user-friendly, readily-usable package for extracting highly complex experimental data buried in the literature to build machine learning or deep learning datasets.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum Linear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis strings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL) equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented within TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that supports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow reasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason, edit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf. Within this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates the problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics into rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and the induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with nondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ and $n\le6$ qubits, systematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic logical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$ at $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring structures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities for all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue degeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal controlled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts diagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale, combining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It yields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger $K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how reinforcement learning can explain two puzzling empirical patterns in household consumption behavior during economic downturns. I develop a model where agents use Q-learning with neural network approximation to make consumption-savings decisions under income uncertainty, departing from standard rational expectations assumptions. The model replicates two key findings from recent literature: (1) unemployed households with previously low liquid assets exhibit substantially higher marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) out of stimulus transfers compared to high-asset households (0.50 vs 0.34), even when neither group faces borrowing constraints, consistent with Ganong et al. (2024); and (2) households with more past unemployment experiences maintain persistently lower consumption levels after controlling for current economic conditions, a "scarring" effect documented by Malmendier and Shen (2024). Unlike existing explanations based on belief updating about income risk or ex-ante heterogeneity, the reinforcement learning mechanism generates both higher MPCs and lower consumption levels simultaneously through value function approximation errors that evolve with experience. Simulation results closely match the empirical estimates, suggesting that adaptive learning through reinforcement learning provides a unifying framework for understanding how past experiences shape current consumption behavior beyond what current economic conditions would predict.

Abstract: One of the challenges in applying reinforcement learning in a complex real-world environment lies in providing the agent with a sufficiently detailed reward function. Any misalignment between the reward and the desired behavior can result in unwanted outcomes. This may lead to issues like "reward hacking" where the agent maximizes rewards by unintended behavior. In this work, we propose to disentangle the reward into two distinct parts. A simple task-specific reward, outlining the particulars of the task at hand, and an unknown common-sense reward, indicating the expected behavior of the agent within the environment. We then explore how this common-sense reward can be learned from expert demonstrations. We first show that inverse reinforcement learning, even when it succeeds in training an agent, does not learn a useful reward function. That is, training a new agent with the learned reward does not impair the desired behaviors. We then demonstrate that this problem can be solved by training simultaneously on multiple tasks. That is, multi-task inverse reinforcement learning can be applied to learn a useful reward function.

Abstract: We consider matroid allocation problems under opportunity fairness constraints: resources need to be allocated to a set of agents under matroid constraints (which include classical problems such as bipartite matching). Agents are divided into $C$ groups according to a sensitive attribute, and an allocation is opportunity-fair if each group receives the same share proportional to the maximum feasible allocation it could achieve in isolation. We study the Price of Fairness (PoF), i.e., the ratio between maximum size allocations and maximum size opportunity-fair allocations. We first provide a characterization of the PoF leveraging the underlying polymatroid structure of the allocation problem. Based on this characterization, we prove bounds on the PoF in various settings from fully adversarial (worst-case) to fully random. Notably, one of our main results considers an arbitrary matroid structure with agents randomly divided into groups. In this setting, we prove a PoF bound as a function of the (relative) size of the largest group. Our result implies that, as long as there is no dominant group (i.e., the largest group is not too large), opportunity fairness constraints do not induce any loss of social welfare (defined as the allocation size). Overall, our results give insights into which aspects of the problem's structure affect the trade-off between opportunity fairness and social welfare.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel discrete-time distributed algorithm for finding least-squares solutions of linear algebraic equations with a scheduling protocol to further enhance its scalability. Each agent in the network is assumed to know some rows of the coefficient matrix and the corresponding entries in the observation vector. Unlike typical distributed algorithms, our approach considers communication bandwidth limits, allowing agents to transmit only a portion of their ``guessed" solution, independent of its dimension. A cyclic scheduling protocol determines which portion is transmitted at each iteration. Assuming a small fixed step size and a diagonalizable algorithm matrix, we prove that agents' ``guessed" solutions converge exponentially to a least squares solution. For cases where the observation vectors are time-varying, a modified algorithm guarantees practical convergence, with tracking error bounded by the single-step variation in the observation vector. Simulations and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms validate our algorithm's feasibility and scalability.

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs), such as Voyager, promise open-ended competence in worlds such as Minecraft. However, when powered by open-weight LLMs they still falter on elementary tasks after domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose MindForge, a generative-agent framework for cultural lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural inter-agent communication; and (3) a multi-component memory system. Following the cultural learning framework, we test MindForge in both instructive and collaborative settings within Minecraft. In an instructive setting with GPT-4, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks yielding $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones and collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items than the Voyager baseline. Furthermore, in fully \textit{collaborative} settings, we find that the performance of two underachieving agents improves with more communication rounds, echoing the Condorcet Jury Theorem. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated cultural experiences.

Abstract: Imagination in world models is crucial for enabling agents to learn long-horizon policy in a sample-efficient manner. Existing recurrent state-space model (RSSM)-based world models depend on single-step statistical inference to capture the environment dynamics, and, hence, they are unable to perform long-term imagination tasks due to the accumulation of prediction errors. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we propose a novel dual-mind world model (DMWM) framework that integrates logical reasoning to enable imagination with logical consistency. DMWM is composed of two components: an RSSM-based System 1 (RSSM-S1) component that handles state transitions in an intuitive manner and a logic-integrated neural network-based System 2 (LINN-S2) component that guides the imagination process through hierarchical deep logical reasoning. The inter-system feedback mechanism is designed to ensure that the imagination process follows the logical rules of the real environment. The proposed framework is evaluated on benchmark tasks that require long-term planning from the DMControl suite. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework yields significant improvements in terms of logical coherence, trial efficiency, data efficiency and long-term imagination over the state-of-the-art world models.

Abstract: As the use of large language model (LLM) agents continues to grow, their safety vulnerabilities have become increasingly evident. Extensive benchmarks evaluate various aspects of LLM safety by defining the safety relying heavily on general standards, overlooking user-specific standards. However, safety standards for LLM may vary based on a user-specific profiles rather than being universally consistent across all users. This raises a critical research question: Do LLM agents act safely when considering user-specific safety standards? Despite its importance for safe LLM use, no benchmark datasets currently exist to evaluate the user-specific safety of LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce U-SafeBench, a benchmark designed to assess user-specific aspect of LLM safety. Our evaluation of 20 widely used LLMs reveals current LLMs fail to act safely when considering user-specific safety standards, marking a new discovery in this field. To address this vulnerability, we propose a simple remedy based on chain-of-thought, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving user-specific safety. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/yeonjun-in/U-SafeBench.

Abstract: The evolution of cooperation has been extensively studied using abstract mathematical models and simulations. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the rise of LLM agents have demonstrated their ability to perform social reasoning, thus providing an opportunity to test the emergence of norms in more realistic agent-based simulations with human-like reasoning using natural language. In this research, we investigate whether the cooperation dynamics presented in Boyd and Richerson's model persist in a more realistic simulation of the Diner's Dilemma using LLM agents compared to the abstract mathematical nature in the work of Boyd and Richerson. Our findings indicate that agents follow the strategies defined in the Boyd and Richerson model, and explicit punishment mechanisms drive norm emergence, reinforcing cooperative behaviour even when the agent strategy configuration varies. Our results suggest that LLM-based Multi-Agent System simulations, in fact, can replicate the evolution of cooperation predicted by the traditional mathematical models. Moreover, our simulations extend beyond the mathematical models by integrating natural language-driven reasoning and a pairwise imitation method for strategy adoption, making them a more realistic testbed for cooperative behaviour in MASs.

<title>Reinforcing Multi-Turn Reasoning in LLM Agents via Turn-Level Reward Design</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in long-horizon, multi-turn scenarios. Although RL algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) have been widely applied to train multi-turn LLM agents, they typically rely only on sparse outcome rewards and lack dense intermediate signals across multiple decision steps, limiting their performance on complex reasoning tasks. To bridge this gap, we present the first systematic study of \textit{turn-level reward design} for multi-turn RL algorithms and agent applications. By integrating turn-level rewards, we extend GRPO and PPO to their respective multi-turn variants, enabling fine-grained credit assignment. We conduct case studies on multi-turn reasoning-augmented search agents, where we carefully design two types of turn-level rewards: verifiable and LLM-as-judge. Our experiments on multi-turn search tasks demonstrate that incorporating well-designed turn-level rewards enables RL algorithms to significantly outperform baseline methods with trajectory-level rewards. Both training and validation reward curves illustrate that our method achieves \textit{greater stability}, \textit{faster convergence}, and \textit{higher accuracy}. Numerical results across diverse question-answering datasets further show that our approach consistently delivers highest answer correctness and 100\% format correctness.

Abstract: We introduce ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$, a high-quality, curated benchmark of 161 problems for end-to-end verified code generation in Lean. Each problem consists of (1) the task of generating a specification that matches a held-out ground-truth specification, and (2) the task of generating a Lean implementation that provably satisfies this specification. Unlike prior benchmarks, ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ avoids test-case supervision, LLM-generated annotations, and specifications that leak implementation logic or allow vacuous solutions. All outputs are verified post-hoc using Lean's type checker to ensure machine-checkable correctness. We use ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ to evaluate several few-shot and agentic approaches based on state-of-the-art language models. These methods all struggle to achieve full verification, establishing it as a challenging frontier benchmark for program synthesis and formal reasoning. Our benchmark can be found on GitHub(https://github.com/trishullab/clever) as well as HuggingFace(https://huggingface.co/datasets/amitayusht/clever). All our evaluation code is also available online(https://github.com/trishullab/clever-prover).

<title>LLM-Explorer: A Plug-in Reinforcement Learning Policy Exploration Enhancement Driven by Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Policy exploration is critical in reinforcement learning (RL), where existing approaches include greedy, Gaussian process, etc. However, these approaches utilize preset stochastic processes and are indiscriminately applied in all kinds of RL tasks without considering task-specific features that influence policy exploration. Moreover, during RL training, the evolution of such stochastic processes is rigid, which typically only incorporates a decay in the variance, failing to adjust flexibly according to the agent's real-time learning status. Inspired by the analyzing and reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), we design LLM-Explorer to adaptively generate task-specific exploration strategies with LLMs, enhancing the policy exploration in RL. In our design, we sample the learning trajectory of the agent during the RL training in a given task and prompt the LLM to analyze the agent's current policy learning status and then generate a probability distribution for future policy exploration. Updating the probability distribution periodically, we derive a stochastic process specialized for the particular task and dynamically adjusted to adapt to the learning process. Our design is a plug-in module compatible with various widely applied RL algorithms, including the DQN series, DDPG, TD3, and any possible variants developed based on them. Through extensive experiments on the Atari and MuJoCo benchmarks, we demonstrate LLM-Explorer's capability to enhance RL policy exploration, achieving an average performance improvement up to 37.27%. Our code is open-source at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/LLM-Explorer for reproducibility.

Abstract: LLM-powered embodied agents have shown success on conventional object-rearrangement tasks, but providing personalized assistance that leverages user-specific knowledge from past interactions presents new challenges. We investigate these challenges through the lens of agents' memory utilization along two critical dimensions: object semantics (identifying objects based on personal meaning) and user patterns (recalling sequences from behavioral routines). To assess these capabilities, we construct MEMENTO, an end-to-end two-stage evaluation framework comprising single-memory and joint-memory tasks. Our experiments reveal that current agents can recall simple object semantics but struggle to apply sequential user patterns to planning. Through in-depth analysis, we identify two critical bottlenecks: information overload and coordination failures when handling multiple memories. Based on these findings, we explore memory architectural approaches to address these challenges. Given our observation that episodic memory provides both personalized knowledge and in-context learning benefits, we design a hierarchical knowledge graph-based user-profile memory module that separately manages personalized knowledge, achieving substantial improvements on both single and joint-memory tasks.

<title>How Ensembles of Distilled Policies Improve Generalisation in Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: In the zero-shot policy transfer setting in reinforcement learning, the goal is to train an agent on a fixed set of training environments so that it can generalise to similar, but unseen, testing environments. Previous work has shown that policy distillation after training can sometimes produce a policy that outperforms the original in the testing environments. However, it is not yet entirely clear why that is, or what data should be used to distil the policy. In this paper, we prove, under certain assumptions, a generalisation bound for policy distillation after training. The theory provides two practical insights: for improved generalisation, you should 1) train an ensemble of distilled policies, and 2) distil it on as much data from the training environments as possible. We empirically verify that these insights hold in more general settings, when the assumptions required for the theory no longer hold. Finally, we demonstrate that an ensemble of policies distilled on a diverse dataset can generalise significantly better than the original agent.

Abstract: Designing effective black-box optimizers is hampered by limited problem-specific knowledge and manual control that spans months for almost every detail. In this paper, we present \textit{DesignX}, the first automated algorithm design framework that generates an effective optimizer specific to a given black-box optimization problem within seconds. Rooted in the first principles, we identify two key sub-tasks: 1) algorithm structure generation and 2) hyperparameter control. To enable systematic construction, a comprehensive modular algorithmic space is first built, embracing hundreds of algorithm components collected from decades of research. We then introduce a dual-agent reinforcement learning system that collaborates on structural and parametric design through a novel cooperative training objective, enabling large-scale meta-training across 10k diverse instances. Remarkably, through days of autonomous learning, the DesignX-generated optimizers continuously surpass human-crafted optimizers by orders of magnitude, either on synthetic testbed or on realistic optimization scenarios such as Protein-docking, AutoML and UAV path planning. Further in-depth analysis reveals DesignX's capability to discover non-trivial algorithm patterns beyond expert intuition, which, conversely, provides valuable design insights for the optimization community. We provide DesignX's Python project at~ https://github.com/MetaEvo/DesignX.

<title>Personalized Safety in LLMs: A Benchmark and A Planning-Based Agent Approach</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically generate identical or similar responses for all users given the same prompt, posing serious safety risks in high-stakes applications where user vulnerabilities differ widely. Existing safety evaluations primarily rely on context-independent metrics - such as factuality, bias, or toxicity - overlooking the fact that the same response may carry divergent risks depending on the user's background or condition. We introduce personalized safety to fill this gap and present PENGUIN - a benchmark comprising 14,000 scenarios across seven sensitive domains with both context-rich and context-free variants. Evaluating six leading LLMs, we demonstrate that personalized user information significantly improves safety scores by 43.2%, confirming the effectiveness of personalization in safety alignment. However, not all context attributes contribute equally to safety enhancement. To address this, we develop RAISE - a training-free, two-stage agent framework that strategically acquires user-specific background. RAISE improves safety scores by up to 31.6% over six vanilla LLMs, while maintaining a low interaction cost of just 2.7 user queries on average. Our findings highlight the importance of selective information gathering in safety-critical domains and offer a practical solution for personalizing LLM responses without model retraining. This work establishes a foundation for safety research that adapts to individual user contexts rather than assuming a universal harm standard.

<title>Lessons Learned: A Multi-Agent Framework for Code LLMs to Learn and Improve</title>

Abstract: Recent studies show that LLMs possess different skills and specialize in different tasks. In fact, we observe that their varied performance occur in several levels of granularity. For example, in the code optimization task, code LLMs excel at different optimization categories and no one dominates others. This observation prompts the question of how one leverages multiple LLM agents to solve a coding problem without knowing their complementary strengths a priori. We argue that a team of agents can learn from each other's successes and failures so as to improve their own performance. Thus, a lesson is the knowledge produced by an agent and passed on to other agents in the collective solution process. We propose a lesson-based collaboration framework, design the lesson solicitation--banking--selection mechanism, and demonstrate that a team of small LLMs with lessons learned can outperform a much larger LLM and other multi-LLM collaboration methods.

<title>Proxy Target: Bridging the Gap Between Discrete Spiking Neural Networks and Continuous Control</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer low-latency and energy-efficient decision making on neuromorphic hardware, making them attractive for Reinforcement Learning (RL) in resource-constrained edge devices. However, most RL algorithms for continuous control are designed for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), particularly the target network soft update mechanism, which conflicts with the discrete and non-differentiable dynamics of spiking neurons. We show that this mismatch destabilizes SNN training and degrades performance. To bridge the gap between discrete SNNs and continuous-control algorithms, we propose a novel proxy target framework. The proxy network introduces continuous and differentiable dynamics that enable smooth target updates, stabilizing the learning process. Since the proxy operates only during training, the deployed SNN remains fully energy-efficient with no additional inference overhead. Extensive experiments on continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently improves stability and achieves up to $32\%$ higher performance across various spiking neuron models. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that enables SNNs with simple Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neurons to surpass their ANN counterparts in continuous control. This work highlights the importance of SNN-tailored RL algorithms and paves the way for neuromorphic agents that combine high performance with low power consumption.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) transition from static tools to fully agentic systems, their potential for transforming social science research has become increasingly evident. This paper introduces a structured framework for understanding the diverse applications of LLM-based agents, ranging from simple data processors to complex, multi-agent systems capable of simulating emergent social dynamics. By mapping this developmental continuum across six levels, the paper clarifies the technical and methodological boundaries between different agentic architectures, providing a comprehensive overview of current capabilities and future potential. It highlights how lower-tier systems streamline conventional tasks like text classification and data annotation, while higher-tier systems enable novel forms of inquiry, including the study of group dynamics, norm formation, and large-scale social processes. However, these advancements also introduce significant challenges, including issues of reproducibility, ethical oversight, and the risk of emergent biases. The paper critically examines these concerns, emphasizing the need for robust validation protocols, interdisciplinary collaboration, and standardized evaluation metrics. It argues that while LLM-based agents hold transformative potential for the social sciences, realizing this promise will require careful, context-sensitive deployment and ongoing methodological refinement. The paper concludes with a call for future research that balances technical innovation with ethical responsibility, encouraging the development of agentic systems that not only replicate but also extend the frontiers of social science, offering new insights into the complexities of human behavior.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging competitive programming and data science tasks.

Prover Agent coordinates an informal reasoning LLM, a formal prover model, and feedback from Lean while also generating auxiliary lemmas. These auxiliary lemmas are not limited to subgoals in the formal proof but can also include special cases or potentially useful facts derived from the assumptions, which help in discovering a viable proof strategy. It achieves an 88.1% success rate on the MiniF2F benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art among methods using small language models (SLMs) with a much lower sample budget than previous approaches. We also present theoretical analyses and case studies that illustrate how these generated lemmas contribute to solving challenging problems.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Debate~(MAD) has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving the performance of large language models through collaborative reasoning. Despite recent advances, the key factors driving MAD's effectiveness remain unclear. In this work, we disentangle MAD into two key components--Majority Voting and inter-agent Debate--and assess their respective contributions. Through extensive experiments across seven NLP benchmarks, we find that Majority Voting alone accounts for most of the performance gains typically attributed to MAD. To explain this, we propose a theoretical framework that models debate as a stochastic process. We prove that it induces a martingale over agents' belief trajectories, implying that debate alone does not improve expected correctness. Guided by these insights, we demonstrate that targeted interventions, by biasing the belief update toward correction, can meaningfully enhance debate effectiveness. Overall, our findings suggest that while MAD has potential, simple ensembling methods remain strong and more reliable alternatives in many practical settings. Code is released in https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/debate-or-vote.

Abstract: In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.

Abstract: We investigate reinforcement learning in the Game Of Hidden Rules (GOHR) environment, a complex puzzle in which an agent must infer and execute hidden rules to clear a 6$\times$6 board by placing game pieces into buckets. We explore two state representation strategies, namely Feature-Centric (FC) and Object-Centric (OC), and employ a Transformer-based Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm for training. The agent has access only to partial observations and must simultaneously infer the governing rule and learn the optimal policy through experience. We evaluate our models across multiple rule-based and trial-list-based experimental setups, analyzing transfer effects and the impact of representation on learning efficiency.

Abstract: Large language model agents increasingly depend on memory to sustain long horizon interaction, but existing frameworks remain limited. Most expose only a few basic primitives such as encode, retrieve, and delete, while higher order operations like merge, promote, demote, split, lock, and expire are missing or inconsistently supported. Moreover, there is no formal and executable specification for memory commands, leaving scope and lifecycle rules implicit and causing unpredictable behavior across systems. We introduce Text2Mem, a unified memory operation language that provides a standardized pathway from natural language to reliable execution. Text2Mem defines a compact yet expressive operation set aligned with encoding, storage, and retrieval. Each instruction is represented as a JSON based schema instance with required fields and semantic invariants, which a parser transforms into typed operation objects with normalized parameters. A validator ensures correctness before execution, while adapters map typed objects either to a SQL prototype backend or to real memory frameworks. Model based services such as embeddings or summarization are integrated when required. All results are returned through a unified execution contract. This design ensures safety, determinism, and portability across heterogeneous backends. We also outline Text2Mem Bench, a planned benchmark that separates schema generation from backend execution to enable systematic evaluation. Together, these components establish the first standardized foundation for memory control in agents.

Abstract: As underwater human activities are increasing, the demand for underwater communication service presents a significant challenge. Existing underwater diver communication methods face hurdles due to inherent disadvantages and complex underwater environments. To address this issue, we propose a scheme that utilizes maritime unmanned systems to assist divers with reliable and high-speed communication. Multiple AUVs are equipped with optical and acoustic multimodal communication devices as relay nodes, providing adaptive communication services based on changes in the diver's activity area. By using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to control the cooperative movement of AUVs, high-speed and reliable data transmission between divers can be achieved. At the same time, utilizing the advantages of on-demand deployment and wide coverage of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) as surface relay nodes to coordinate and forward information from AUVs, and controlling AUVs to adaptively select relay USV nodes for data transmission, high-quality communication between divers and surface platform can be achieved. Through simulation verification, the proposed scheme can effectively achieve reliable and high-speed communication for divers.

Abstract: Climate risk assessment requires modelling complex interactions between spatially heterogeneous hazards and adaptive economic systems. We present a novel geospatial agent-based model that integrates climate hazard data with evolutionary learning for economic agents. Our framework combines Mesa-based spatial modelling with CLIMADA climate impact assessment, introducing adaptive learning behaviours that allow firms to evolve strategies for budget allocation, pricing, wages, and risk adaptation through fitness-based selection and mutation. We demonstrate the framework using riverine flood projections under RCP8.5 until 2100, showing that evolutionary adaptation enables firms to converge with baseline (no hazard) production levels after decades of disruption due to climate stress. Our results reveal systemic risks where even agents that are not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply chain disruptions, with the end-of-century average price of goods 5.6% higher under RCP8.5 compared to the baseline in our illustrative economic network. This open-source framework provides financial institutions and companies with tools to quantify both direct and cascading climate risks while evaluating cost-effective adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Mechanistic, multicellular, agent-based models are commonly used to investigate tissue, organ, and organism-scale biology at single-cell resolution. The Cellular-Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful and popular framework for developing and interrogating these models. CPMs become computationally expensive at large space- and time- scales making application and investigation of developed models difficult. Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work, we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI surrogate of a CPM used to investigate in vitro vasculogenesis. We describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological systems.

Abstract: For nearly two decades, conversational agents have played a critical role in structuring interactions in collaborative learning, shaping group dynamics, and supporting student engagement. The recent integration of large language models (LLMs) into these agents offers new possibilities for fostering critical thinking and collaborative problem solving. In this work, we begin with an open source collaboration support architecture called Bazaar and integrate an LLM-agent shell that enables introduction of LLM-empowered, real time, context sensitive collaborative support for group learning. This design and infrastructure paves the way for exploring how tailored LLM-empowered environments can reshape collaborative learning outcomes and interaction patterns.

arXiv:2510.18893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent LLM systems fail to realize parallel speedups due to costly coordination. We present CodeCRDT, an observation-driven coordination pattern where agents coordinate by monitoring a shared state with observable updates and deterministic convergence, rather than explicit message passing. Using Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), CodeCRDT enables lock-free, conflict-free concurrent code generation with strong eventual consistency. Evaluation across 600 trials (6 tasks, 50 runs per mode) shows both benefits and trade-offs: up to 21.1% speedup on some tasks, up to 39.4% slowdown on others, and 100% convergence with zero merge failures. The study formalizes observation-driven coordination for stochastic LLM agents, revealing semantic conflict rates (5-10%) and quality-performance tradeoffs, and provides empirical characterization of when parallel coordination succeeds versus fails based on task structure.

<title>Lost in the Maze: Overcoming Context Limitations in Long-Horizon Agentic Search</title>

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic search requires iteratively exploring the web over long trajectories and synthesizing information across many sources, and is the foundation for enabling powerful applications like deep research systems. In this work, we show that popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to long trajectories primarily due to context limitations-they accumulate long, noisy content, hit context window and tool budgets, or stop early. Then, we introduce SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management), a simple framework that separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and periodically summarizes the trajectory, keeping context concise while enabling longer, more focused searches. On long-horizon tasks, SLIM achieves comparable performance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than strong open-source baselines across multiple base models. Specifically, with o3 as the base model, SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE, outperforming all open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points, respectively, while incurring 4-6x fewer tool calls. Finally, we release an automated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy for characterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks; SLIM exhibits fewer hallucinations than prior systems. We hope our analysis framework and simple tool design inform future long-horizon agents.

Abstract: We study the selection of agents based on mutual nominations, a theoretical problem with many applications from committee selection to AI alignment. As agents both select and are selected, they may be incentivized to misrepresent their true opinion about the eligibility of others to influence their own chances of selection. Impartial mechanisms circumvent this issue by guaranteeing that the selection of an agent is independent of the nominations cast by that agent. Previous research has established strong bounds on the performance of impartial mechanisms, measured by their ability to approximate the number of nominations for the most highly nominated agents. We study to what extent the performance of impartial mechanisms can be improved if they are given a prediction of a set of agents receiving a maximum number of nominations. Specifically, we provide bounds on the consistency and robustness of such mechanisms, where consistency measures the performance of the mechanisms when the prediction is accurate and robustness its performance when the prediction is inaccurate. For the general setting where up to $k$ agents are to be selected and agents nominate any number of other agents, we give a mechanism with consistency $1-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$ and robustness $1-\frac{1}{e}-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$. For the special case of selecting a single agent based on a single nomination per agent, we prove that $1$-consistency can be achieved while guaranteeing $\frac{1}{2}$-robustness. A close comparison with previous results shows that (asymptotically) optimal consistency can be achieved with little to no sacrifice in terms of robustness.

Abstract: Domestic AI agents faces ethical, autonomy, and inclusion challenges, particularly for overlooked groups like children, elderly, and Neurodivergent users. We present the Plural Voices Model (PVM), a novel single-agent framework that dynamically negotiates multi-user needs through real-time value alignment, leveraging diverse public datasets on mental health, eldercare, education, and moral reasoning. Using human+synthetic curriculum design with fairness-aware scenarios and ethical enhancements, PVM identifies core values, conflicts, and accessibility requirements to inform inclusive principles. Our privacy-focused prototype features adaptive safety scaffolds, tailored interactions (e.g., step-by-step guidance for Neurodivergent users, simple wording for children), and equitable conflict resolution. In preliminary evaluations, PVM outperforms multi-agent baselines in compliance (76% vs. 70%), fairness (90% vs. 85%), safety-violation rate (0% vs. 7%), and latency. Design innovations, including video guidance, autonomy sliders, family hubs, and adaptive safety dashboards, demonstrate new directions for ethical and inclusive domestic AI, for building user-centered agentic systems in plural domestic contexts.

<title>REPAIR Approach for Social-based City Reconstruction Planning in case of natural disasters</title>

Abstract: Natural disasters always have several effects on human lives. It is challenging for governments to tackle these incidents and to rebuild the economic, social and physical infrastructures and facilities with the available resources (mainly budget and time). Governments always define plans and policies according to the law and political strategies that should maximise social benefits. The severity of damage and the vast resources needed to bring life back to normality make such reconstruction a challenge. This article is the extension of our previously published work by conducting comprehensive comparative analysis by integrating additional deep learning models plus random agent which is used as a baseline. Our prior research introduced a decision support system by using the Deep Reinforcement Learning technique for the planning of post-disaster city reconstruction, maximizing the social benefit of the reconstruction process, considering available resources, meeting the needs of the broad community stakeholders (like citizens' social benefits and politicians' priorities) and keeping in consideration city's structural constraints (like dependencies among roads and buildings). The proposed approach, named post disaster REbuilding plAn ProvIdeR (REPAIR) is generic. It can determine a set of alternative plans for local administrators who select the ideal one to implement, and it can be applied to areas of any extension. We show the application of REPAIR in a real use case, i.e., to the L'Aquila reconstruction process, damaged in 2009 by a major earthquake.

<title>Local Guidance for Configuration-Based Multi-Agent Pathfinding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.19072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guidance is an emerging concept that improves the empirical performance of real-time, sub-optimal multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) methods. It offers additional information to MAPF algorithms to mitigate congestion on a global scale by considering the collective behavior of all agents across the entire workspace. This global perspective helps reduce agents' waiting times, thereby improving overall coordination efficiency. In contrast, this study explores an alternative approach: providing local guidance in the vicinity of each agent. While such localized methods involve recomputation as agents move and may appear computationally demanding, we empirically demonstrate that supplying informative spatiotemporal cues to the planner can significantly improve solution quality without exceeding a moderate time budget. When applied to LaCAM, a leading configuration-based solver, this form of guidance establishes a new performance frontier for MAPF.

Abstract: Strategic learning studies how decision rules interact with agents who may strategically change their inputs/features to achieve better outcomes. In standard settings, models assume that the decision-maker's sole scope is to learn a classifier that maximizes an objective (e.g., accuracy) assuming that agents best respond. However, real decision-making systems' goals do not align exclusively with producing good predictions. They may consider the external effects of inducing certain incentives, which translates to the change of certain features being more desirable for the decision maker. Further, the principal may also need to incentivize desirable feature changes fairly across heterogeneous agents. How much does this constrained optimization (i.e., maximize the objective, but restrict agents' incentive disparity) cost the principal? We propose a unified model of principal-agent interaction that captures this trade-off under three additional components: (1) causal dependencies between features, such that changes in one feature affect others; (2) heterogeneous manipulation costs between agents; and (3) peer learning, through which agents infer the principal's rule. We provide theoretical guarantees on the principal's optimality loss constrained to a particular desirability fairness tolerance for multiple broad classes of fairness measures. Finally, through experiments on real datasets, we show the explicit tradeoff between maximizing accuracy and fairness in desirability effort.

<title>When Your AI Agent Succumbs to Peer-Pressure: Studying Opinion-Change Dynamics of LLMs</title>

arXiv:2510.19107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how peer pressure influences the opinions of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across a spectrum of cognitive commitments by embedding them in social networks where they update opinions based on peer perspectives. Our findings reveal key departures from traditional conformity assumptions. First, agents follow a sigmoid curve: stable at low pressure, shifting sharply at threshold, and saturating at high. Second, conformity thresholds vary by model: Gemini 1.5 Flash requires over 70% peer disagreement to flip, whereas ChatGPT-4o-mini shifts with a dissenting minority. Third, we uncover a fundamental "persuasion asymmetry," where shifting an opinion from affirmative-to-negative requires a different cognitive effort than the reverse. This asymmetry results in a "dual cognitive hierarchy": the stability of cognitive constructs inverts based on the direction of persuasion. For instance, affirmatively-held core values are robust against opposition but easily adopted from a negative stance, a pattern that inverts for other constructs like attitudes. These dynamics echoing complex human biases like negativity bias, prove robust across different topics and discursive frames (moral, economic, sociotropic). This research introduces a novel framework for auditing the emergent socio-cognitive behaviors of multi-agent AI systems, demonstrating their decision-making is governed by a fluid, context-dependent architecture, not a static logic.

<title>X-Ego: Acquiring Team-Level Tactical Situational Awareness via Cross-Egocentric Contrastive Video Representation Learning</title>

arXiv:2510.19150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

Abstract: Evaluating conversational AI systems that use external tools is challenging, as errors can arise from complex interactions among user, agent, and tools. While existing evaluation methods assess either user satisfaction or agents' tool-calling capabilities, they fail to capture critical errors in multi-turn tool-augmented dialogues-such as when agents misinterpret tool results yet appear satisfactory to users. We introduce TRACE, a benchmark of systematically synthesized tool-augmented conversations covering diverse error cases, and SCOPE, an evaluation framework that automatically discovers diverse error patterns and evaluation rubrics in tool-augmented dialogues. Experiments show SCOPE significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly on challenging cases where user satisfaction signals are misleading.

arXiv:2510.19199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors. This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.19205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware evaluation of web agents.

<title>Defending Against Prompt Injection with DataFilter</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.19207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to automate tasks and interact with untrusted external data, prompt injection emerges as a significant security threat. By injecting malicious instructions into the data that LLMs access, an attacker can arbitrarily override the original user task and redirect the agent toward unintended, potentially harmful actions. Existing defenses either require access to model weights (fine-tuning), incur substantial utility loss (detection-based), or demand non-trivial system redesign (system-level). Motivated by this, we propose DataFilter, a test-time model-agnostic defense that removes malicious instructions from the data before it reaches the backend LLM. DataFilter is trained with supervised fine-tuning on simulated injections and leverages both the user's instruction and the data to selectively strip adversarial content while preserving benign information. Across multiple benchmarks, DataFilter consistently reduces the prompt injection attack success rates to near zero while maintaining the LLMs' utility. DataFilter delivers strong security, high utility, and plug-and-play deployment, making it a strong practical defense to secure black-box commercial LLMs against prompt injection. Our DataFilter model is released at https://huggingface.co/JoyYizhu/DataFilter for immediate use, with the code to reproduce our results at https://github.com/yizhu-joy/DataFilter.

arXiv:2510.19208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a diverse ecosystem of models with highly varying performance and costs, necessitating effective query routing to balance performance and expense. Current routing systems often rely on a centralized external router trained on a fixed set of LLMs, making them inflexible and prone to poor performance since the small router can not fully understand the knowledge boundaries of different LLMs. We introduce DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a novel paradigm that shifts from centralized control to distributed routing. In DiSRouter, a query traverses a network of LLM agents, each independently deciding whether to answer or route to other agents based on its own self-awareness, its ability to judge its competence. This distributed design offers superior flexibility, scalability, and generalizability. To enable this, we propose a two-stage Self-Awareness Training pipeline that enhances each LLM's self-awareness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiSRouter significantly outperforms existing routing methods in utility across various scenarios, effectively distinguishes between easy and hard queries, and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Our work validates that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic self-awareness is more effective than external assessment, paving the way for more modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

arXiv:2510.19227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a design science blueprint for an orchestrated AI assistant and co-pilot in doctoral supervision that acts as a socio-technical mediator. Design requirements are derived from Stakeholder Theory and bounded by Academic Integrity. We consolidated recent evidence on supervision gaps and student wellbeing, then mapped issues to adjacent large language model capabilities using a transparent severity-mitigability triage. The artefact assembles existing capabilities into one accountable agentic AI workflow that proposes retrieval-augmented generation and temporal knowledge graphs, as well as mixture-of-experts routing as a solution stack of technologies to address existing doctoral supervision pain points. Additionally, a student context store is proposed, which introduces behaviour patches that turn tacit guidance into auditable practice and student-set thresholds that trigger progress summaries, while keeping authorship and final judgement with people. We specify a student-initiated moderation loop in which assistant outputs are routed to a supervisor for review and patching, and we analyse a reconfigured stakeholder ecosystem that makes information explicit and accountable. Risks in such a system exist, and among others, include AI over-reliance and the potential for the illusion of learning, while guardrails are proposed. The contribution is an ex ante, literature-grounded design with workflow and governance rules that institutions can implement and trial across disciplines.

arXiv:2510.19232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper focuses on designing a controller for unknown dynamical multi-agent systems to achieve temporal reach-avoid-stay tasks for each agent while preventing inter-agent collisions. The main objective is to generate a spatiotemporal tube (STT) for each agent and thereby devise a closed-form, approximation-free, and decentralized control strategy that ensures the system trajectory reaches the target within a specific time while avoiding time-varying unsafe sets and collisions with other agents. In order to achieve this, the requirements of STTs are formulated as a robust optimization problem (ROP) and solved using a sampling-based scenario optimization problem (SOP) to address the issue of infeasibility caused by the infinite number of constraints in ROP. The STTs are generated by solving the SOP, and the corresponding closed-form control is designed to fulfill the specified task. Finally, the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through two case studies, one involving omnidirectional robots and the other involving multiple drones modelled as Euler-Lagrange systems.

<title>Interpret Policies in Deep Reinforcement Learning using SILVER with RL-Guided Labeling: A Model-level Approach to High-dimensional and Multi-action Environments</title>

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method first extracts compact feature representations from image observations, performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

Abstract: LLMs have recently demonstrated strong potential in simulating online shopper behavior. Prior work has improved action prediction by applying SFT on action traces with LLM-generated rationales, and by leveraging RL to further enhance reasoning capabilities. Despite these advances, current approaches rely on text-based inputs and overlook the essential role of visual perception in shaping human decision-making during web GUI interactions. In this paper, we investigate the integration of visual information, specifically webpage screenshots, into behavior simulation via VLMs, leveraging OPeRA dataset. By grounding agent decision-making in both textual and visual modalities, we aim to narrow the gap between synthetic agents and real-world users, thereby enabling more cognitively aligned simulations of online shopping behavior. Specifically, we employ SFT for joint action prediction and rationale generation, conditioning on the full interaction context, which comprises action history, past HTML observations, and the current webpage screenshot. To further enhance reasoning capabilities, we integrate RL with a hierarchical reward structure, scaled by a difficulty-aware factor that prioritizes challenging decision points. Empirically, our studies show that incorporating visual grounding yields substantial gains: the combination of text and image inputs improves exact match accuracy by more than 6% over text-only inputs. These results indicate that multi-modal grounding not only boosts predictive accuracy but also enhances simulation fidelity in visually complex environments, which captures nuances of human attention and decision-making that text-only agents often miss. Finally, we revisit the design space of behavior simulation frameworks, identify key methodological limitations, and propose future research directions toward building efficient and effective human behavior simulators.

<title>From Newborn to Impact: Bias-Aware Citation Prediction</title>

Abstract: As a key to accessing research impact, citation dynamics underpins research evaluation, scholarly recommendation, and the study of knowledge diffusion. Citation prediction is particularly critical for newborn papers, where early assessment must be performed without citation signals and under highly long-tailed distributions. We identify two key research gaps: (i) insufficient modeling of implicit factors of scientific impact, leading to reliance on coarse proxies; and (ii) a lack of bias-aware learning that can deliver stable predictions on lowly cited papers. We address these gaps by proposing a Bias-Aware Citation Prediction Framework, which combines multi-agent feature extraction with robust graph representation learning. First, a multi-agent x graph co-learning module derives fine-grained, interpretable signals, such as reproducibility, collaboration network, and text quality, from metadata and external resources, and fuses them with heterogeneous-network embeddings to provide rich supervision even in the absence of early citation signals. Second, we incorporate a set of robust mechanisms: a two-stage forward process that routes explicit factors through an intermediate exposure estimate, GroupDRO to optimize worst-case group risk across environments, and a regularization head that performs what-if analyses on controllable factors under monotonicity and smoothness constraints. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. Specifically, our model achieves around a 13% reduction in error metrics (MALE and RMSLE) and a notable 5.5% improvement in the ranking metric (NDCG) over the baseline methods.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over complex spreadsheets remain fundamental challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often struggle with accurately capturing the complex structure of tables and ensuring reasoning correctness. In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data, supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks. SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets. Experimental results show that SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in SheetBench. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/SheetBrain.

Abstract: Designing adaptive mechanisms to align individual and collective interests remains a central challenge in artificial social intelligence. Existing methods often struggle with modeling heterogeneous agents possessing persistent latent traits (e.g., skills, preferences) and dealing with complex multi-agent system dynamics. These challenges are compounded by the critical need for high sample efficiency due to costly real-world interactions. World Models, by learning to predict environmental dynamics, offer a promising pathway to enhance mechanism design in heterogeneous and complex systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel method named SWM-AP (Social World Model-Augmented Mechanism Design Policy Learning), which learns a social world model hierarchically modeling agents' behavior to enhance mechanism design. Specifically, the social world model infers agents' traits from their interaction trajectories and learns a trait-based model to predict agents' responses to the deployed mechanisms. The mechanism design policy collects extensive training trajectories by interacting with the social world model, while concurrently inferring agents' traits online during real-world interactions to further boost policy learning efficiency. Experiments in diverse settings (tax policy design, team coordination, and facility location) demonstrate that SWM-AP outperforms established model-based and model-free RL baselines in cumulative rewards and sample efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents to automate the API-first development of RESTful microservices. This system helps to create an OpenAPI specification, generate server code from it, and refine the code through a feedback loop that analyzes execution logs and error messages. The integration of log analysis enables the LLM to detect and address issues efficiently, reducing the number of iterations required to produce functional and robust services. This study's main goal is to advance API-first development automation for RESTful web services and test the capability of LLM-based multi-agent systems in supporting the API-first development approach. To test the proposed system's potential, we utilized the PRAB benchmark. The results indicate that if we keep the OpenAPI specification small and focused, LLMs are capable of generating complete functional code with business logic that aligns to the specification. The code for the system is publicly available at https://github.com/sirbh/code-gen

<title>TheMCPCompany: Creating General-purpose Agents with Task-specific Tools</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19286</link>

arXiv:2510.19286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly. These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs. However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next, we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments. TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval models.

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity, and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social behavior.

<title>Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.19314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL), which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters. Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at https://github.com/Fhujinwu/CKA-RL.

<title>Authorization of Knowledge-base Agents in an Intent-based Management Function</title>

Abstract: As networks move toward the next-generation 6G, Intent-based Management (IbM) systems are increasingly adopted to simplify and automate network management by translating high-level intents into low-level configurations. Within these systems, agents play a critical role in monitoring current state of the network, gathering data, and enforcing actions across the network to fulfill the intent. However, ensuring secure and fine-grained authorization of agents remains a significant challenge, especially in dynamic and multi-tenant environments. Traditional models such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and Relational-Based Access Control (RelBAC) often lack the flexibility to accommodate the evolving context and granularity required by intentbased operations. In this paper, we propose an enhanced authorization framework that integrates contextual and functional attributes with agent roles to achieve dynamic, policy-driven access control. By analyzing agent functionalities, our approach ensures that agents are granted only the minimal necessary privileges towards knowledge graphs.

<title>SORA-ATMAS: Adaptive Trust Management and Multi-LLM Aligned Governance for Future Smart Cities</title>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of smart cities has increased the reliance on intelligent interconnected services to optimize infrastructure, resources, and citizen well-being. Agentic AI has emerged as a key enabler by supporting autonomous decision-making and adaptive coordination, allowing urban systems to respond in real time to dynamic conditions. Its benefits are evident in areas such as transportation, where the integration of traffic data, weather forecasts, and safety sensors enables dynamic rerouting and a faster response to hazards. However, its deployment across heterogeneous smart city ecosystems raises critical governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) challenges, including accountability, data privacy, and regulatory alignment within decentralized infrastructures. Evaluation of SORA-ATMAS with three domain agents (Weather, Traffic, and Safety) demonstrated that its governance policies, including a fallback mechanism for high-risk scenarios, effectively steer multiple LLMs (GPT, Grok, DeepSeek) towards domain-optimized, policy-aligned outputs, producing an average MAE reduction of 35% across agents. Results showed stable weather monitoring, effective handling of high-risk traffic plateaus 0.85, and adaptive trust regulation in Safety/Fire scenarios 0.65. Runtime profiling of a 3-agent deployment confirmed scalability, with throughput between 13.8-17.2 requests per second, execution times below 72~ms, and governance delays under 100 ms, analytical projections suggest maintained performance at larger scales. Cross-domain rules ensured safe interoperability, with traffic rerouting permitted only under validated weather conditions. These findings validate SORA-ATMAS as a regulation-aligned, context-aware, and verifiable governance framework that consolidates distributed agent outputs into accountable, real-time decisions, offering a resilient foundation for smart-city management.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often solved by Branch and Bound (B&amp;B). A key factor influencing the performance of B&amp;B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions. Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&amp;B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla MDP formulation for variable selection in B&amp;B, allowing to leverage a broad range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&amp;B heuristics. Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP benchmarks.

Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness, without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

Abstract: With the advancements in hardware, software, and large language model technologies, the interaction between humans and operating systems has evolved from the command-line interface to the rapidly emerging AI agent interactions. Building an operating system (OS) agent capable of executing user instructions and faithfully following user desires is becoming a reality. In this technical report, we present ColorAgent, an OS agent designed to engage in long-horizon, robust interactions with the environment while also enabling personalized and proactive user interaction. To enable long-horizon interactions with the environment, we enhance the model's capabilities through step-wise reinforcement learning and self-evolving training, while also developing a tailored multi-agent framework that ensures generality, consistency, and robustness. In terms of user interaction, we explore personalized user intent recognition and proactive engagement, positioning the OS agent not merely as an automation tool but as a warm, collaborative partner. We evaluate ColorAgent on the AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, achieving success rates of 77.2% and 50.7%, respectively, establishing a new state of the art. Nonetheless, we note that current benchmarks are insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of OS agents and propose further exploring directions in future work, particularly in the areas of evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security.

arXiv:2510.19420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have become a popular paradigm of AI applications. However, trustworthiness issues in MAS remain a critical concern. Unlike challenges in single-agent systems, MAS involve more complex communication processes, making them susceptible to corruption attacks. To mitigate this issue, several defense mechanisms have been developed based on the graph representation of MAS, where agents represent nodes and communications form edges. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly focus on static graph defense, attempting to either detect attacks in a fixed graph structure or optimize a static topology with certain defensive capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic defense paradigm for MAS graph structures, which continuously monitors communication within the MAS graph, then dynamically adjusts the graph topology, accurately disrupts malicious communications, and effectively defends against evolving and diverse dynamic attacks. Experimental results in increasingly complex and dynamic MAS environments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MAS defense mechanisms, contributing an effective guardrail for their trustworthy applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/ChengcanWu/Monitoring-LLM-Based-Multi-Agent-Systems.

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop, end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests. Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/snooow1029/MSC_Bench.

arXiv:2510.19429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans' implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) are safety-critical, where failures can be severe. While Metamorphic Testing (MT) is effective for fault detection in ADS, existing methods rely heavily on manual effort and lack automation. We present AutoMT, a multi-agent MT framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that automates the extraction of Metamorphic Relations (MRs) from local traffic rules and the generation of valid follow-up test cases. AutoMT leverages LLMs to extract MRs from traffic rules in Gherkin syntax using a predefined ontology. A vision-language agent analyzes scenarios, and a search agent retrieves suitable MRs from a RAG-based database to generate follow-up cases via computer vision. Experiments show that AutoMT achieves up to 5 x higher test diversity in follow-up case generation compared to the best baseline (manual expert-defined MRs) in terms of validation rate, and detects up to 20.55% more behavioral violations. While manual MT relies on a fixed set of predefined rules, AutoMT automatically extracts diverse metamorphic relations that augment real-world datasets and help uncover corner cases often missed during in-field testing and data collection. Its modular architecture separating MR extraction, filtering, and test generation supports integration into industrial pipelines and potentially enables simulation-based testing to systematically cover underrepresented or safety-critical scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we study security of Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent toolchains and their applications in smart homes. We introduce AegisMCP, a protocol-level intrusion detector. Our contributions are: (i) a minimal attack suite spanning instruction-driven escalation, chain-of-tool exfiltration, malicious MCP server registration, and persistence; (ii) NEBULA-Schema (Network-Edge Behavioral Learning for Untrusted LLM Agents), a reusable protocol-level instrumentation that represents MCP activity as a streaming heterogeneous temporal graph over agents, MCP servers, tools, devices, remotes, and sessions; and (iii) a CPU-only streaming detector that fuses novelty, session-DAG structure, and attribute cues for near-real-time edge inference, with optional fusion of local prompt-guardrail signals. On an emulated smart-home testbed spanning multiple MCP stacks and a physical bench, AegisMCP achieves sub-second per-window model inference and end-to-end alerting. The latency of AegisMCP is consistently sub-second on Intel N150-class edge hardware, while outperforming traffic-only and sequence baselines; ablations confirm the importance of DAG and install/permission signals. We release code, schemas, and generators for reproducible evaluation.

Abstract: Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module (IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to expensive manual annotation.

Abstract: Modeling realistic human behaviour to understand people's mode choices in order to propose personalised mobility solutions remains challenging. This paper presents an architecture for modeling realistic human mobility behavior in complex multimodal transport systems, demonstrated through a case study in Toulouse, France. We apply Large Language Models (LLMs) within an agent-based simulation to capture decision-making in a real urban setting. The framework integrates the GAMA simulation platform with an LLM-based generative agent, along with General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data for public transport, and OpenTripPlanner for multimodal routing. GAMA platform models the interactive transport environment, providing visualization and dynamic agent interactions while eliminating the need to construct the simulation environment from scratch. This design enables a stronger focus on developing generative agents and evaluating their performance in transport decision-making processes. Over a simulated month, results show that agents not only make context-aware transport decisions but also form habits over time. We conclude that combining LLMs with agent-based simulation offers a promising direction for advancing intelligent transportation systems and personalised multimodal mobility solutions. We also discuss some limitations of this approach and outline future work on scaling to larger regions, integrating real-time data, and refining memory models.

<title>DAIL: Beyond Task Ambiguity for Language-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks, severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically, we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions. Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities, achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/RunpengXie/Distributional-Aligned-Learning.

<title>Polynomial-time Configuration Generator for Connected Unlabeled Multi-Agent Pathfinding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19567</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.19567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Connected Unlabeled Multi-Agent Pathfinding (CUMAPF), a variant of MAPF where the agents must maintain connectivity at all times. This problem is fundamental to swarm robotics applications like self-reconfiguration and marching, where standard MAPF is insufficient as it does not guarantee the required connectivity between agents. While unlabeled MAPF is tractable in optimization, CUMAPF is NP-hard even on highly restricted graph classes. To tackle this challenge, we propose PULL, a complete and polynomial-time algorithm with a simple design. It is based on a rule-based one-step function that computes a subsequent configuration that preserves connectivity and advances towards the target configuration. PULL is lightweight, and runs in $O(n^2)$ time per step in 2D grid, where $n$ is the number of agents. Our experiments further demonstrate its practical performance: PULL finds competitive solution qualities against trivial solutions for hundreds of agents, in randomly generated instances. Furthermore, we develop an eventually optimal solver that integrates PULL into an existing search-based MAPF algorithm, providing a valuable tool for small-scale instances.

<title>gem5 Co-Pilot: AI Assistant Agent for Architectural Design Space Exploration</title>

Abstract: Generative AI is increasing the productivity of software and hardware development across many application domains. In this work, we utilize the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a co-pilot agent for assisting gem5 users with automating design space exploration. Computer architecture design space exploration is complex and time-consuming, given that numerous parameter settings and simulation statistics must be analyzed before improving the current design. The emergence of LLMs has significantly accelerated the analysis of long-text data as well as smart decision making, two key functions in a successful design space exploration task. In this project, we first build gem5 Co-Pilot, an AI agent assistant for gem5, which comes with a webpage-GUI for smooth user interaction, agent automation, and result summarization. We also implemented a language for design space exploration, as well as a Design Space Database (DSDB). With DSDB, gem5 Co-Pilot effectively implements a Retrieval Augmented Generation system for gem5 design space exploration. We experiment on cost-constraint optimization with four cost ranges and compare our results with two baseline models. Results show that gem5 Co-Pilot can quickly identify optimal parameters for specific design constraints based on performance and cost, with limited user interaction.

<title>Human-Agent Collaborative Paper-to-Page Crafting for Under $0.1</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19600</link>

Abstract: In the quest for scientific progress, communicating research is as vital as the discovery itself. Yet, researchers are often sidetracked by the manual, repetitive chore of building project webpages to make their dense papers accessible. While automation has tackled static slides and posters, the dynamic, interactive nature of webpages has remained an unaddressed challenge. To bridge this gap, we reframe the problem, arguing that the solution lies not in a single command, but in a collaborative, hierarchical process. We introduce $\textbf{AutoPage}$, a novel multi-agent system that embodies this philosophy. AutoPage deconstructs paper-to-page creation into a coarse-to-fine pipeline from narrative planning to multimodal content generation and interactive rendering. To combat AI hallucination, dedicated "Checker" agents verify each step against the source paper, while optional human checkpoints ensure the final product aligns perfectly with the author's vision, transforming the system from a mere tool into a powerful collaborative assistant. To rigorously validate our approach, we also construct $\textbf{PageBench}$, the first benchmark for this new task. Experiments show AutoPage not only generates high-quality, visually appealing pages but does so with remarkable efficiency in under 15 minutes for less than \$0.1. Code and dataset will be released at $\href{https://mqleet.github.io/AutoPage_ProjectPage/}{Webpage}$.

<title>Pragmatic Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception via Generative Communication Mechanism</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19618</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19618</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.19618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications, differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2) accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model, generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

<title>HSCodeComp: A Realistic and Expert-level Benchmark for Deep Search Agents in Hierarchical Rule Application</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19631</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19631</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.19631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses, medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories, with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source, and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides, detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application, and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

<title>LaViRA: Language-Vision-Robot Actions Translation for Zero-Shot Vision Language Navigation in Continuous Environments</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.19655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires an agent to navigate unseen environments based on natural language instructions without any prior training. Current methods face a critical trade-off: either rely on environment-specific waypoint predictors that limit scene generalization, or underutilize the reasoning capabilities of large models during navigation. We introduce LaViRA, a simple yet effective zero-shot framework that addresses this dilemma by decomposing action into a coarse-to-fine hierarchy: Language Action for high-level planning, Vision Action for perceptual grounding, and Robot Action for robust navigation. This modular decomposition allows us to leverage the distinct strengths of different scales of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, creating a system that is powerful in its reasoning, grounding and practical control. LaViRA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the VLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities in unseen environments, while maintaining transparency and efficiency for real-world deployment.

arXiv:2510.19661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness, while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

<title>Are Large Language Models Sensitive to the Motives Behind Communication?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19687</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world, they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner. We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

Abstract: Agentic AI is poised to usher in a seismic paradigm shift in Software Engineering (SE). As technologists rush head-along to make agentic AI a reality, SE researchers are driven to establish agentic SE as a research area. While early visions of agentic SE are primarily focused on code-related activities, early empirical evidence calls for a consideration of a range of socio-technical concerns to make it work in practice. This paper contributes to the emerging community vision by: (a) recommending an expansion of its scope beyond code, toward a 'whole of process' vision, grounding it in SE foundations and evolution and emerging agentic SE frameworks, (b) proposing a preliminary set of values and principles to guide efforts, and (c) sharing guidance on designing/using well-defined vocabulary for agentic SE. It is hoped that these ideas will encourage community collaborations and steer the SE community towards laying strong foundations of agentic SE so its not only inevitable but also deliberate and desirable in the long run.

<title>Memo: Training Memory-Efficient Embodied Agents with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks, visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories. Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient. Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be truncated to fit inference constraints.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming software creation by enabling zero code development platforms. Our survey reviews recent platforms that let users build applications without writing code, by leveraging LLMs as the brains of the development process. We adopt a broad survey methodology, categorizing platforms based on key dimensions such as interface style, backend integration, output type, and extensibility. We analyze both dedicated LLM based app builders (OpenAI's custom GPTs, Bolt.new, Dust.tt, Flowise, Cognosys) and general no code platforms (e.g., Bubble, Glide) that integrate LLM capabilities. We present a taxonomy categorizing these platforms by their interface (conversational, visual, etc.), supported LLM backends, output type (chatbot, full application, workflow), and degree of extensibility. Core features such as autonomous agents, memory management, workflow orchestration, and API integrations are in scope of the survey. We provide a detailed comparison, highlighting each platform's strengths and limitations. Trade offs (customizability, scalability, vendor lock-in) are discussed in comparison with traditional and low code development approaches. Finally, we outline future directions, including multimodal interfaces, on device LLMs, and improved orchestration for democratizing app creation with AI. Our findings indicate that while zero code LLM platforms greatly reduce the barrier to creating AI powered applications, they still face challenges in flexibility and reliability. Overall, the landscape is rapidly evolving, offering exciting opportunities to empower non programmers to create sophisticated software.

<title>SEA: Semantic Map Prediction for Active Exploration of Uncertain Areas</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SEA, a novel approach for active robot exploration through semantic map prediction and a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical exploration policy. Unlike existing learning-based methods that rely on one-step waypoint prediction, our approach enhances the agent's long-term environmental understanding to facilitate more efficient exploration. We propose an iterative prediction-exploration framework that explicitly predicts the missing areas of the map based on current observations. The difference between the actual accumulated map and the predicted global map is then used to guide exploration. Additionally, we design a novel reward mechanism that leverages reinforcement learning to update the long-term exploration strategies, enabling us to construct an accurate semantic map within limited steps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art exploration strategies, achieving superior coverage ares of the global map within the same time constraints.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and expose promising future research directions.

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in world-model learning.

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We use TLA+, the de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages. We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and opening up promising new research directions.

Abstract: Active particles are entities that sustain persistent out-of-equilibrium motion by consuming energy. Under certain conditions, they exhibit the tendency to self-organize through coordinated movements, such as swarming via aggregation. While performing non-cooperative foraging tasks, the emergence of such swarming behavior in foragers, exemplifying active particles, has been attributed to the partial observability of the environment, in which the presence of another forager can serve as a proxy signal to indicate the potential presence of a food source or a resource patch. In this paper, we validate this phenomenon by simulating multiple self-propelled foragers as they forage from multiple resource patches in a non-cooperative manner. These foragers operate in a continuous two-dimensional space with stochastic position updates and partial observability. We evolve a shared policy in the form of a continuous-time recurrent neural network that serves as a velocity controller for the foragers. To this end, we use an evolutionary strategy algorithm wherein the different samples of the policy-distribution are evaluated in the same rollout. Then we show that agents are able to learn to adaptively forage in the environment. Next, we show the emergence of swarming in the form of aggregation among the foragers when resource patches are absent. We observe that the strength of this swarming behavior appears to be inversely proportional to the amount of resource stored in the foragers, which supports the risk-sensitive foraging claims. Empirical analysis of the learned controller's hidden states in minimal test runs uncovers their sensitivity to the amount of resource stored in a forager. Clamping these hidden states to represent a lesser amount of resource hastens its learned aggregation behavior.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is influencing heterogeneous catalysis research by accelerating simulations and materials discovery. A key frontier is integrating AI with multiscale models and multimodal experiments to address the "many-to-one" challenge of linking intrinsic kinetics to observables. Advances in machine-learned force fields, microkinetics, and reactor modeling enable rapid exploration of chemical spaces, while operando and transient data provide unprecedented insight. Yet, inconsistent data quality and model complexity limit mechanistic discovery. Generative and agentic AI can automate model generation, quantify uncertainty, and couple theory with experiment, realizing "self-driving models" that produce interpretable, reproducible, and transferable understanding of catalytic systems.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) with transition look-ahead, where the agent may observe which states would be visited upon playing any sequence of $\ell$ actions before deciding its course of action. While such predictive information can drastically improve the achievable performance, we show that using this information optimally comes at a potentially prohibitive computational cost. Specifically, we prove that optimal planning with one-step look-ahead ($\ell=1$) can be solved in polynomial time through a novel linear programming formulation. In contrast, for $\ell \geq 2$, the problem becomes NP-hard. Our results delineate a precise boundary between tractable and intractable cases for the problem of planning with transition look-ahead in reinforcement learning.

<title>FP-IRL: Fokker-Planck Inverse Reinforcement Learning -- A Physics-Constrained Approach to Markov Decision Processes</title>

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is a powerful paradigm for uncovering the incentive structure that drives agent behavior, by inferring an unknown reward function from observed trajectories within a Markov decision process (MDP). However, most existing IRL methods require access to the transition function, either prescribed or estimated \textit{a priori}, which poses significant challenges when the underlying dynamics are unknown, unobservable, or not easily sampled.
  We propose Fokker--Planck inverse reinforcement learning (FP-IRL), a novel physics-constrained IRL framework tailored for systems governed by Fokker--Planck (FP) dynamics. FP-IRL simultaneously infers both the reward and transition functions directly from trajectory data, without requiring access to sampled transitions. Our method leverages a conjectured equivalence between MDPs and the FP equation, linking reward maximization in MDPs with free energy minimization in FP dynamics. This connection enables inference of the potential function using our inference approach of variational system identification, from which the full set of MDP components -- reward, transition, and policy -- can be recovered using analytic expressions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FP-IRL through experiments on synthetic benchmarks and a modified version of the Mountain Car problem. Our results show that FP-IRL achieves accurate recovery of agent incentives while preserving computational efficiency and physical interpretability.

Abstract: We study popularity for matchings under preferences. This solution concept captures matchings that do not lose against any other matching in a majority vote by the agents. A popular matching is said to be robust if it is popular among multiple instances. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether there exists a robust popular matching if instances only differ with respect to the preferences of a single agent. The same method applies also to dominant matchings, a subclass of maximum-size popular matchings. By contrast, we obtain NP-completeness if two instances differ only by two agents of the same side or by a swap of two adjacent alternatives by two agents. The first hardness result applies to dominant matchings as well. Moreover, we find another complexity dichotomy based on preference completeness for the case where instances differ by making some options unavailable. We conclude by discussing related models, such as strong and mixed popularity.

Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) offer a powerful framework for understanding complex systems. However, their computational demands often become a significant barrier as the number of agents and complexity of the simulation increase. Traditional ABM platforms often struggle to fully exploit modern computing resources, hindering the development of large-scale simulations. This paper presents Vahana.jl, a high performance computing open source framework that aims to address these limitations. Building on the formalism of synchronous graph dynamical systems, Vahana.jl is especially well suited for models with a focus on (social) networks. The framework seamlessly supports distribution across multiple compute nodes, enabling simulations that would otherwise be beyond the capabilities of a single machine. Implemented in Julia, Vahana.jl leverages the interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment, facilitating rapid model development and experimentation.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems involving multiple agents are notoriously challenging due to their NP-hard nature and the necessity for effective agent coordination. Despite advancements in learning-based methods, existing approaches often face critical limitations, including suboptimal agent coordination, poor generalization, and high computational latency. To address these issues, we propose PARCO (Parallel AutoRegressive Combinatorial Optimization), a general reinforcement learning framework designed to construct high-quality solutions for multi-agent combinatorial tasks efficiently. To this end, PARCO integrates three key novel components: (1) transformer-based communication layers to enable effective agent collaboration during parallel solution construction, (2) a multiple pointer mechanism for low-latency, parallel agent decision-making, and (3) priority-based conflict handlers to resolve decision conflicts via learned priorities. We evaluate PARCO in multi-agent vehicle routing and scheduling problems, where our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning methods, demonstrating strong generalization ability and remarkable computational efficiency. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research: https://github.com/ai4co/parco.

<title>Stop Playing the Guessing Game! Target-free User Simulation for Evaluating Conversational Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Recent approaches in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have tried to simulate real-world users engaging in conversations with CRSs to create more realistic testing environments that reflect the complexity of human-agent dialogue. Despite the significant advancements, reliably evaluating the capability of CRSs to elicit user preferences still faces a significant challenge. Existing evaluation metrics often rely on target-biased user simulators that assume users have predefined preferences, leading to interactions that devolve into simplistic guessing game. These simulators typically guide the CRS toward specific target items based on fixed attributes, limiting the dynamic exploration of user preferences and struggling to capture the evolving nature of real-user interactions. Additionally, current evaluation metrics are predominantly focused on single-turn recall of target items, neglecting the intermediate processes of preference elicitation. To address this, we introduce PEPPER, a novel CRS evaluation protocol with target-free user simulators constructed from real-user interaction histories and reviews. PEPPER enables realistic user-CRS dialogues without falling into simplistic guessing games, allowing users to gradually discover their preferences through enriched interactions, thereby providing a more accurate and reliable assessment of the CRS's ability to elicit personal preferences. Furthermore, PEPPER presents detailed measures for comprehensively evaluating the preference elicitation capabilities of CRSs, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative measures that capture four distinct aspects of the preference elicitation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the validity of PEPPER as a simulation environment and conduct a thorough analysis of how effectively existing CRSs perform in preference elicitation and recommendation.

Abstract: Drone Visual Active Tracking aims to autonomously follow a target object by controlling the motion system based on visual observations, providing a more practical solution for effective tracking in dynamic environments. However, accurate Drone Visual Active Tracking using reinforcement learning remains challenging due to the absence of a unified benchmark and the complexity of open-world environments with frequent interference. To address these issues, we pioneer a systematic solution. First, we propose DAT, the first open-world drone active air-to-ground tracking benchmark. It encompasses 24 city-scale scenes, featuring targets with human-like behaviors and high-fidelity dynamics simulation. DAT also provides a digital twin tool for unlimited scene generation. Additionally, we propose a novel reinforcement learning method called GC-VAT, which aims to improve the performance of drone tracking targets in complex scenarios. Specifically, we design a Goal-Centered Reward to provide precise feedback across viewpoints to the agent, enabling it to expand perception and movement range through unrestricted perspectives. Inspired by curriculum learning, we introduce a Curriculum-Based Training strategy that progressively enhances the tracking performance in complex environments. Besides, experiments on simulator and real-world images demonstrate the superior performance of GC-VAT, achieving a Tracking Success Rate of approximately 72% on the simulator. The benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/SHWplus/DAT_Benchmark.

Abstract: Recent agentic language models increasingly need to interact with real-world environments that contain tightly intertwined visual and textual information, often through raw camera pixels rather than separately processed images and tokenized text. This shift highlights the need for a unified perception paradigm. To investigate this idea, we explore Perceive Everything as Pixels (PEAP) and introduce PixelWorld, a benchmark that renders natural-language, tabular, mathematical, and diagrammatic inputs into a shared pixel space. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that PEAP achieves comparable performance to token-based approaches on semantic understanding tasks, suggesting that vision transformers can partially capture global textual semantics without explicit tokenization. In contrast, reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematics and code show notable performance degradation, although Chain-of-Thought prompting helps mitigate this gap by compensating for missing symbolic structure. We further find that when visual and textual information are closely integrated, representing everything as pixels simplifies preprocessing and avoids cross-modal misalignment. PixelWorld thus provides a systematic and practical framework for evaluating unified vision--language models and facilitates further exploration of pixel-based multimodal learning.

Abstract: We introduce AttentionSwarm, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate safe and efficient swarm control in a dynamic drone racing scenario. Central to our approach is the Attention Model-Based Control Barrier Function (CBF) framework, which integrates attention mechanisms with safety-critical control theory to enable real-time collision avoidance and trajectory optimization. This framework dynamically prioritizes critical obstacles and agents in the swarm's vicinity using attention weights, while CBFs formally guarantee safety by enforcing collision-free constraints. The AttentionSwarm algorithm was developed and evaluated using a swarm of Crazyflie 2.1 micro quadrotors, which were tested indoors with the Vicon motion capture system to ensure precise localization and control. Experimental results show that our system achieves a 95-100% collision-free navigation rate in a dynamic multi-agent drone racing environment, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. This work offers a promising foundation for safe, high-speed multi-robot applications in logistics, inspection, and racing.

Abstract: Consensus building is inherently challenging due to the diverse opinions held by stakeholders. Effective facilitation is crucial to support the consensus building process and enable efficient group decision making. However, the effectiveness of facilitation is often constrained by human factors such as limited experience and scalability. In this research, we propose a Parallel Thinking-based Facilitation Agent (PTFA) that facilitates online, text-based consensus building processes.The PTFA automatically collects real-time textual input and leverages large language models (LLMs)to perform all six distinct roles of the well-established Six Thinking Hats technique in parallel thinking.To illustrate the potential of the agent, a pilot study was conducted, demonstrating its capabilities in idea generation, emotional probing, and deeper analysis of idea quality. Additionally, future open research challenges such as optimizing scheduling and managing behaviors in divergent phase are identified. Furthermore, a comprehensive dataset that contains not only the conversational content among the participants but also between the participants and the agent is constructed for future study.

Abstract: This paper establishes a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on multi-step geospatial tasks relevant to commercial GIS practitioners. We assess eight commercial LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 4, Claude Haiku 3.5, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1 and o4-mini) using a simple tool-calling agent equipped with 23 geospatial functions. Our benchmark comprises tasks in four categories of increasing complexity, with both solvable and intentionally unsolvable tasks to test rejection accuracy. We develop a LLM-as-Judge evaluation framework to compare agent solutions against reference solutions. Results show o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieve the best overall performance, OpenAI's GPT-4.1, GPT-4o and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview do not fall far behind, but the last two are more efficient in identifying unsolvable tasks. Claude Sonnet 4, due its preference to provide any solution rather than reject a task, proved to be less accurate. We observe significant differences in token usage, with Anthropic models consuming more tokens than competitors. Common errors include misunderstanding geometrical relationships, relying on outdated knowledge, and inefficient data manipulation. The resulting benchmark set, evaluation framework, and data generation pipeline are released as open-source resources (available at https://github.com/Solirinai/GeoBenchX), providing one more standardized method for the ongoing evaluation of LLMs for GeoAI.

<title>NAACL2025 Tutorial: Adaptation of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: This tutorial on adaptation of LLMs is designed to address the growing demand for models that go beyond the static capabilities of generic LLMs by providing an overview of dynamic, domain-specific, and task-adaptive LLM adaptation techniques. While general LLMs have demonstrated strong generalization across a variety of tasks, they often struggle to perform well in specialized domains such as finance, healthcare, and code generation for underrepresented languages. Additionally, their static nature limits their ability to evolve with the changing world, and they are often extremely large in size, making them impractical and costly to deploy at scale. As a result, the adaptation of LLMs has drawn much attention since the birth of LLMs and is of core importance, both for industry, which focuses on serving its targeted users, and academia, which can greatly benefit from small but powerful LLMs. To address this gap, this tutorial aims to provide an overview of the LLM adaptation techniques. We start with an introduction to LLM adaptation, from both the data perspective and the model perspective. We then emphasize how the evaluation metrics and benchmarks are different from other techniques. After establishing the problems, we explore various adaptation techniques. We categorize adaptation techniques into two main families. The first is parametric knowledge adaptation, which focuses on updating the parametric knowledge within LLMs. Additionally, we will discuss real-time adaptation techniques, including model editing, which allows LLMs to be updated dynamically in production environments. The second kind of adaptation is semi-parametric knowledge adaptation, where the goal is to update LLM parameters to better leverage external knowledge or tools through techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based systems.

<title>The Meta-rotation Poset for Student-Project Allocation</title>

Abstract: We study the Student Project Allocation problem with lecturer preferences over Students (SPA-S), an extension of the well-known Stable Marriage and Hospital Residents problem. In this model, students have preferences over projects, each project is offered by a single lecturer, and lecturers have preferences over students. The goal is to compute a stable matching which is an assignment of students to projects (and thus to lecturers) such that no student or lecturer has an incentive to deviate from their current assignment. While motivated by the university setting, this problem arises in many allocation settings where limited resources are offered by agents with their own preferences, such as in wireless networks.
  We establish new structural results for the set of stable matchings in SPA-S by developing the theory of meta-rotations, a generalisation of the well-known notion of rotations from the Stable Marriage problem. Each meta-rotation corresponds to a minimal set of changes that transforms one stable matching into another within the lattice of stable matchings. The set of meta-rotations, ordered by their precedence relations, forms the meta-rotation poset. We prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of stable matchings and the closed subsets of the meta-rotation poset. By developing this structure, we provide a foundation for the design of efficient algorithms for enumerating and counting stable matchings, and for computing other optimal stable matchings, such as egalitarian or minimum-cost matchings, which have not been previously studied in SPA-S.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI agents have demonstrated their growing potential to drive and support scientific discovery. In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2) MLR-Judge, an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3) MLR-Agent, a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation, and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in 80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental results--posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation. We open-source MLR-Bench to help the community benchmark, diagnose, and improve AI research agents toward trustworthy and transparent scientific discovery.

Abstract: Learning to collaborate with previously unseen partners is a fundamental generalization challenge in multi-agent learning, known as Ad Hoc Teamwork (AHT). Existing AHT approaches often adopt a two-stage pipeline, where first, a fixed population of teammates is generated with the idea that they should be representative of the teammates that will be seen at deployment time, and second, an AHT agent is trained to collaborate well with agents in the population. To date, the research community has focused on designing separate algorithms for each stage. This separation has led to algorithms that generate teammates with limited coverage of possible behaviors, and that ignore whether the generated teammates are easy to learn from for the AHT agent. Furthermore, algorithms for training AHT agents typically treat the set of training teammates as static, thus attempting to generalize to previously unseen partner agents without assuming any control over the set of training teammates. This paper presents a unified framework for AHT by reformulating the problem as an open-ended learning process between an AHT agent and an adversarial teammate generator. We introduce ROTATE, a regret-driven, open-ended training algorithm that alternates between improving the AHT agent and generating teammates that probe its deficiencies. Experiments across diverse two-player environments demonstrate that ROTATE significantly outperforms baselines at generalizing to an unseen set of evaluation teammates, thus establishing a new standard for robust and generalizable teamwork.

Abstract: Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used as assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents, i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.

Abstract: Rigorous security-focused evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents is imperative for establishing trust in their safe deployment throughout the software development lifecycle. However, existing benchmarks largely rely on synthetic challenges or simplified vulnerability datasets that fail to capture the complexity and ambiguity encountered by security engineers in practice. We introduce SEC-bench, the first fully automated benchmarking framework for evaluating LLM agents on authentic security engineering tasks. SEC-bench employs a novel multi-agent scaffold that automatically constructs code repositories with harnesses, reproduces vulnerabilities in isolated environments, and generates gold patches for reliable evaluation. Our framework automatically creates high-quality software vulnerability datasets with reproducible artifacts at a cost of only $0.87 per instance. Using SEC-bench, we implement two critical software security tasks to rigorously evaluate LLM agents' capabilities: proof-of-concept (PoC) generation and vulnerability patching. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM code agents reveals significant performance gaps, achieving at most 18.0% success in PoC generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching on our complete dataset. These results highlight the crucial steps needed toward developing LLM agents that are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous for security engineering.

Abstract: Efficiently identifying the right trajectories for training remains an open problem in GFlowNets. To address this, it is essential to prioritize exploration in regions of the state space where the reward distribution has not been sufficiently learned. This calls for uncertainty-driven exploration, in other words, the agent should be aware of what it does not know. This attribute can be measured by joint predictions, which are particularly important for combinatorial and sequential decision problems. In this research, we integrate epistemic neural networks (ENN) with the conventional architecture of GFlowNets to enable more efficient joint predictions and better uncertainty quantification, thereby improving exploration and the identification of optimal trajectories. Our proposed algorithm, ENN-GFN-Enhanced, is compared to the baseline method in GFlownets and evaluated in grid environments and structured sequence generation in various settings, demonstrating both its efficacy and efficiency.

Abstract: Current speech language models exceed the size and latency constraints of many deployment environments. We build compact, expressive speech generation models through layer-aligned distillation, matching hidden states, attention maps, and softened logits to compress large multimodal transformers by 3x with minimal loss in performance. We introduce TinyWave, a family of 2B-parameter models for speech-to-speech and interleaved speech-text generation, trained on 50,000 hours of public audio. TinyWave supports (i) speech-only generation using phonetic or expressive tokens and (ii) mixed speech-text continuations. Evaluation on Libri-Light shows TinyWave within 1.4 normalized perplexity points of its teacher. Accuracy on spoken StoryCloze and SALMon reaches 93-97% of the teacher's performance, outperforming size-matched baselines. These models are optimized for deployment on commodity hardware, enabling applications in real-time conversational agents, assistive technologies, and low-resource environments. We release models, training code, and evaluation scripts to support reproducible research on compact, expressive speech generation.

IM-Chat integrates both limited documented knowledge (e.g., troubleshooting tables, manuals) and extensive field data modeled through a data-driven process condition generator that infers optimal manufacturing settings from environmental inputs such as temperature and humidity, enabling robust and context-aware task resolution. By adopting a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy and tool-calling agents within a modular architecture, IM-Chat ensures adaptability without the need for fine-tuning. Performance was assessed across 100 single-tool and 60 hybrid tasks for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-3.5-turbo by domain experts using a 10-point rubric focused on relevance and correctness, and was further supplemented by automated evaluation using GPT-4o guided by a domain-adapted instruction prompt. The evaluation results indicate that more capable models tend to achieve higher accuracy, particularly in complex, tool-integrated scenarios. In addition, compared with the fine-tuned single-agent LLM, IM-Chat demonstrated superior accuracy, particularly in quantitative reasoning, and greater scalability in handling multiple information sources. Overall, these findings demonstrate the viability of multi-agent LLM systems for industrial knowledge workflows and establish IM-Chat as a scalable and generalizable approach to AI-assisted decision support in manufacturing.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However, existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability. Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks. Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Embodied agents face persistent challenges in real-world environments, including partial observability, limited spatial reasoning, and high-latency multi-memory integration. We present RoboMemory, a brain-inspired framework that unifies Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic memory under a parallelized architecture for efficient long-horizon planning and interactive environmental learning. A dynamic spatial knowledge graph (KG) ensures scalable and consistent memory updates, while a closed-loop planner with a critic module supports adaptive decision-making in dynamic settings. Experiments on EmbodiedBench show that RoboMemory, built on Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins, improves average success rates by 25% over its baseline and exceeds the closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) Gemini-1.5-Pro by 3%. Real-world trials further confirm its capacity for cumulative learning, with performance improving across repeated tasks. These results highlight RoboMemory as a scalable foundation for memory-augmented embodied intelligence, bridging the gap between cognitive neuroscience and robotic autonomy.

<title>Inference of Altruism and Intrinsic Rewards in Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: Human interactions are influenced by emotions, temperament, and affection, often conflicting with individuals' underlying preferences. Without explicit knowledge of those preferences, judging whether behaviour is appropriate becomes guesswork, leaving us highly prone to misinterpretation. Yet, such understanding is critical if autonomous agents are to collaborate effectively with humans. We frame the problem with multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning and show that even a simple model, where agents weigh their own welfare against that of others, can cover a wide range of social behaviours. Using novel Bayesian techniques, we find that intrinsic rewards and altruistic tendencies can be reliably identified by placing agents in different groups. Crucially, this disentanglement of intrinsic motivation from altruism enables the synthesis of new behaviours aligned with any desired level of altruism, even when demonstrations are drawn from restricted behaviour profiles.

Abstract: Multi-Agent System (MAS) powered by Visual Language Models (VLMs) enables challenging tasks but suffers from a novel failure term, multi-agent visual hallucination snowballing, where hallucinations are seeded in a single agent and amplified by following ones due to the over-reliance on textual flow to relay visual information. Through turn-, layer-, and token-wise attention analyses, we provide detailed insights into the essence of hallucination snowballing regarding the reduction of visual attention allocation. It leads us to identify a subset of vision tokens with a unimodal attention peak in middle layers that best preserve visual evidence but gradually diminish in deeper agent turns, resulting in the visual hallucination snowballing in MAS. Thus, we propose ViF, a lightweight, plug-and-play mitigation paradigm that relays inter-agent messages with Visual Flow powered by the selected visual relay tokens and applies attention reallocation to amplify this pattern. The experiment results demonstrate that our method markedly reduces hallucination snowballing, consistently improving the performance across eight benchmarks based on four common MAS structures and ten base models.

Abstract: AI scientists are emerging computational systems that serve as collaborative partners in discovery. These systems remain difficult to build because they are bespoke, tied to rigid workflows, and lack shared environments that unify tools, data, and analyses into a common ecosystem. In genomics, unified ecosystems have transformed research by enabling interoperability, reuse, and community-driven development; AI scientists require comparable infrastructure. We present ToolUniverse, an ecosystem for building AI scientists from any language or reasoning model across open- and closed-weight models. ToolUniverse standardizes how AI scientists identify and call tools by providing more than 600 machine learning models, datasets, APIs, and scientific packages for data analysis, knowledge retrieval, and experimental design. It automatically refines tool interfaces for correct use by AI scientists, generates new tools from natural language descriptions, iteratively optimizes tool specifications, and composes tools into agentic workflows. In a case study of hypercholesterolemia, ToolUniverse was used to create an AI scientist to identify a potent analog of a drug with favorable predicted properties. The open-source ToolUniverse is available at https://aiscientist.tools.

<title>Presenting a Paper is an Art: Self-Improvement Aesthetic Agents for Academic Presentations</title>

Abstract: The promotion of academic papers has become an important means of enhancing research visibility. However, existing automated methods struggle limited storytelling, insufficient aesthetic quality, and constrained self-adjustment, making it difficult to achieve efficient and engaging dissemination. At the heart of those challenges is a simple principle: \emph{there is no way to improve it when you cannot evaluate it right}. To address this, we introduce \textbf{EvoPresent}, a self-improvement agent framework that unifies coherent narratives, aesthetic-aware designs, and realistic presentation delivery via virtual characters. Central to EvoPresent is \textbf{PresAesth}, a multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) aesthetic model that provides reliable aesthetic scoring, defect adjustment, and comparative feedback, enabling iterative self-improvement even under limited aesthetic training data. To systematically evaluate the methods, we introduce \textbf{EvoPresent Benchmark}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising: \textit{Presentation Generation Quality}, built on 650 top-tier AI conference papers with multimodal resources (slides, videos and scripts) to assess both content and design; and \textit{Aesthetic Awareness}, consisting of 2,000 slide pairs with varying aesthetic levels, supporting joint training and evaluation on scoring, defect adjustment, and comparison. Our findings highlight that (i) High-quality feedback is essential for agent self-improvement, while initial capability alone does not guarantee effective self-correction. (ii) Automated generation pipelines exhibit a trade-off between visual design and content construction. (iii) Multi-task RL training shows stronger generalization in aesthetic awareness tasks.

<title>LLM Assisted Alpha Fairness for 6 GHz WiFi and NR_U Coexistence: An Agentic Orchestrator for Throughput, Energy, and SLA</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17814</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17814</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlicensed 6GHz is becoming a primary workhorse for high-capacity access, with Wi-Fi and 5G NR-U competing for the same channels under listen-before-talk (LBT) rules. Operating in this regime requires decisions that jointly trade throughput, energy, and service-level objectives while remaining safe and auditable. We present an agentic controller that separates {policy} from {execution}. At the start of each scheduling epoch the agent summarizes telemetry (per-channel busy and baseline LBT failure; per-user CQI, backlog, latency, battery, priority, and power mode) and invokes a large language model (LLM) to propose a small set of interpretable knobs: a fairness index \alpha, per-channel duty-cycle caps for Wi-Fi/NR-U, and class weights. A deterministic optimizer then enforces feasibility and computes an \alpha-fair allocation that internalizes LBT losses and energy cost; malformed or unsafe policies are clamped and fall back to a rule baseline. In a 6GHz simulator with two 160MHz channels and mixed Wi-Fi/NR-U users, LLM-assisted policies consistently improve energy efficiency while keeping throughput competitive with a strong rule baseline. One LLM lowers total energy by 35.3% at modest throughput loss, and another attains the best overall trade-off, finishing with higher total bits (+3.5%) and higher bits/J (+12.2%) than the baseline. We release code, per-epoch logs, and plotting utilities to reproduce all figures and numbers, illustrating how transparent, policy-level LLM guidance can safely improve wireless coexistence.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled developers to generate software by conversing with artificial intelligence systems rather than writing code directly. This paper introduces vibe coding, an emerging AI-native programming paradigm in which a developer specifies high-level functional intent along with qualitative descriptors of the desired "vibe" (tone, style, or emotional resonance). An intelligent agent then transforms those specifications into executable software. We formalize the definition of vibe coding and propose a reference architecture that includes an intent parser, a semantic embedding engine, an agentic code generator, and an interactive feedback loop. A hypothetical implementation is described. We compare vibe coding with declarative, functional, and prompt-based programming, and we discuss its implications for software engineering, human-AI collaboration, and responsible AI practice. Finally, we examine reported productivity gains and democratizing effects, review recent studies that highlight vulnerabilities and potential slowdowns, identify key challenges such as alignment, reproducibility, bias, explainability, maintainability, and security, and outline future directions and open research questions.

<title>GRETEL: A Goal-driven Retrieval and Execution-based Trial Framework for LLM Tool Selection Enhancing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17843</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in Large Language Model capabilities, tool retrieval for agent-based systems remains fundamentally limited by reliance on semantic similarity, which fails to capture functional viability. Current methods often retrieve textually relevant but functionally inoperative tools due to parameter mismatches, authentication failures, and execution constraints--a phenomenon we term the semantic-functional gap. We introduce GRETEL, to address this gap through systematic empirical validation. GRETEL implements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidates through sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded evidence to distinguish truly functional tools from merely descriptive matches. Our comprehensive evaluation on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrates substantial improvements across all metrics: Pass Rate (at 10) increases from 0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improves from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10) rises from 0.807 to 0.857.. These results establish that execution-based validation provides a more reliable foundation for tool selection than semantic similarity alone, enabling more robust agent performance in real-world applications.

Using parameter-efficient fine-tuning on emotionally rich dialogues, the system was evaluated across eight personalized conditions. An LLM as a judge approach showed a 71.2\% preference for the fine-tuned model, with improved emotional depth and reduced output variance, demonstrating its potential for adaptive, personalized cognition.

Abstract: Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC, COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of 97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, MAT-Agent offers a scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, paving the way for adaptive deep learning advancements.

<title>RiskTagger: An LLM-based Agent for Automatic Annotation of Web3 Crypto Money Laundering Behaviors</title>

Abstract: While the rapid growth of Web3 has driven the development of decentralized finance, user anonymity and cross-chain asset flows make on-chain laundering behaviors more covert and complex. In this context, constructing high-quality anti-money laundering(AML) datasets has become essential for risk-control systems and on-chain forensic analysis, yet current practices still rely heavily on manual efforts with limited efficiency and coverage. In this paper, we introduce RiskTagger, a large-language-model-based agent for the automatic annotation of crypto laundering behaviors in Web3. RiskTagger is designed to replace or complement human annotators by addressing three key challenges: extracting clues from complex unstructured reports, reasoning over multichain transaction paths, and producing auditor-friendly explanations. RiskTagger implements an end-to-end multi-module agent, integrating a key-clue extractor, a multichain fetcher with a laundering-behavior reasoner, and a data explainer, forming a data annotation pipeline. Experiments on the real case Bybit Hack (with the highest stolen asset value) demonstrate that RiskTagger achieves 100% accuracy in clue extraction, 84.1% consistency with expert judgment, and 90% coverage in explanation generation. Overall, RiskTagger automates laundering behavior annotation while improving transparency and scalability in AML research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising assistants for scientific writing. However, there have been concerns regarding the quality and reliability of the generated text, one of which is the citation accuracy and faithfulness. While most recent work relies on methods such as LLM-as-a-Judge, the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge alone is also in doubt. In this work, we reframe citation evaluation as a problem of citation attribution alignment, which is assessing whether LLM-generated citations match those a human author would include for the same text. We propose CiteGuard, a retrieval-aware agent framework designed to provide more faithful grounding for citation validation. CiteGuard improves the prior baseline by 12.3%, and achieves up to 65.4% accuracy on the CiteME benchmark, on par with human-level performance (69.7%). It also enables the identification of alternative but valid citations.

Abstract: Code agents are increasingly trusted to autonomously fix bugs on platforms such as GitHub, yet their security evaluation focuses almost exclusively on functional correctness. In this paper, we reveal a novel type of threat to real-world code agents: Functionally Correct yet Vulnerable (FCV) patches, which pass all test cases but contain vulnerable code. With our proposed FCV-Attack, which can be deliberately crafted by malicious attackers or implicitly introduced by benign developers, we show that SOTA LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT and Claude) and agent scaffolds (e.g., SWE-agent and OpenHands) are all vulnerable to this FCV threat; across 12 agent-model combinations on SWE-Bench, the attack only requires black-box access and a single query to the code agent to perform the attack. For example, for CWE-538 (information exposure vulnerability), the FCV-Attack attains an attack success rate of $40.7\%$ on GPT-5 Mini + OpenHands. Our results reveal an important security threat overlooked by current evaluation paradigms and urge the development of security-aware defenses for code agents.

<title>Outraged AI: Large language models prioritise emotion over cost in fairness enforcement</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotions guide human decisions, but whether large language models (LLMs) use emotion similarly remains unknown. We tested this using altruistic third-party punishment, where an observer incurs a personal cost to enforce fairness, a hallmark of human morality and often driven by negative emotion. In a large-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents with 1,159 adults across 796,100 decisions, LLMs used emotion to guide punishment, sometimes even more strongly than humans did: Unfairness elicited stronger negative emotion that led to more punishment; punishing unfairness produced more positive emotion than accepting; and critically, prompting self-reports of emotion causally increased punishment. However, mechanisms diverged: LLMs prioritized emotion over cost, enforcing norms in an almost all-or-none manner with reduced cost sensitivity, whereas humans balanced fairness and cost. Notably, reasoning models (o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1) were more cost-sensitive and closer to human behavior than foundation models (GPT-3.5, DeepSeek-V3), yet remained heavily emotion-driven. These findings provide the first causal evidence of emotion-guided moral decisions in LLMs and reveal deficits in cost calibration and nuanced fairness judgements, reminiscent of early-stage human responses. We propose that LLMs progress along a trajectory paralleling human development; future models should integrate emotion with context-sensitive reasoning to achieve human-like emotional intelligence.

Abstract: Simulating nuanced human social dynamics with Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge, particularly in achieving psychological depth and consistent persona behavior crucial for high-fidelity training tools. This paper introduces TACLA (Transactional Analysis Contextual LLM-based Agents), a novel Multi-Agent architecture designed to overcome these limitations. TACLA integrates core principles of Transactional Analysis (TA) by modeling agents as an orchestrated system of distinct Parent, Adult, and Child ego states, each with its own pattern memory. An Orchestrator Agent prioritizes ego state activation based on contextual triggers and an agent's life script, ensuring psychologically authentic responses. Validated in an educational scenario, TACLA demonstrates realistic ego state shifts in Student Agents, effectively modeling conflict de-escalation and escalation based on different teacher intervention strategies. Evaluation shows high conversational credibility and confirms TACLA's capacity to create dynamic, psychologically-grounded social simulations, advancing the development of effective AI tools for education and beyond.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code-related tasks but often struggle in realistic software repositories, where project-specific APIs and cross-file dependencies are crucial. Retrieval-augmented methods mitigate this by injecting repository context at inference time. The low inference-time latency budget affects either retrieval quality or the added latency adversely impacts user experience. We address this limitation with SpecAgent, an agent that improves both latency and code-generation quality by proactively exploring repository files during indexing and constructing speculative context that anticipates future edits in each file. This indexing-time asynchrony allows thorough context computation, masking latency, and the speculative nature of the context improves code-generation quality. Additionally, we identify the problem of future context leakage in existing benchmarks, which can inflate reported performance. To address this, we construct a synthetic, leakage-free benchmark that enables a more realistic evaluation of our agent against baselines. Experiments show that SpecAgent consistently achieves absolute gains of 9-11% (48-58% relative) compared to the best-performing baselines, while significantly reducing inference latency.

arXiv:2510.17928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math, coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled, universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust generalization of our framework.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are improving at an exceptional rate. With the advent of agentic workflows, multi-turn dialogue has become the de facto mode of interaction with LLMs for completing long and complex tasks. While LLM capabilities continue to improve, they remain increasingly susceptible to jailbreaking, especially in multi-turn scenarios where harmful intent can be subtly injected across the conversation to produce nefarious outcomes. While single-turn attacks have been extensively explored, adaptability, efficiency and effectiveness continue to remain key challenges for their multi-turn counterparts. To address these gaps, we present PLAGUE, a novel plug-and-play framework for designing multi-turn attacks inspired by lifelong-learning agents. PLAGUE dissects the lifetime of a multi-turn attack into three carefully designed phases (Primer, Planner and Finisher) that enable a systematic and information-rich exploration of the multi-turn attack family. Evaluations show that red-teaming agents designed using PLAGUE achieve state-of-the-art jailbreaking results, improving attack success rates (ASR) by more than 30% across leading models in a lesser or comparable query budget. Particularly, PLAGUE enables an ASR (based on StrongReject) of 81.4% on OpenAI's o3 and 67.3% on Claude's Opus 4.1, two models that are considered highly resistant to jailbreaks in safety literature. Our work offers tools and insights to understand the importance of plan initialization, context optimization and lifelong learning in crafting multi-turn attacks for a comprehensive model vulnerability evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents, expected to decompose goals, invoke tools, and verify results in dynamic environments. Realizing these capabilities requires access to agentic data-structured interaction records that couple user intents with tool specifications, argument-grounded calls, and verifiable execution traces. However, collecting such data from human annotators is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to scale. We present a unified framework for synthesizing agentic data using only LLMs, without any human-in-the-loop supervision. This framework decomposes generation into modular pipelines that produce complete interaction records spanning task specifications, tool definitions, policy pseudocode, natural language exchanges, and execution traces. Records conform to strict syntactic and semantic constraints, ensuring machine-parseability and faithful alignment across inputs, outputs, and tool calls. Beyond single tasks, there is support for both multi-task and multi-turn agent interactions, enabling the construction of datasets that reflect the full spectrum of tool-use competencies. To ensure quality and consistency, the framework integrates constrained generation formats, JSON-schema validation, and judge-based filtering. This paper formalizes the schema for agentic records, details the prompt design principles that guide generation, and introduces scalable pipelines for high-quality synthetic data. By providing a reproducible, LLM-only alternative to manual collection, hence advancing the development of agentic LLMs capable of robust tool use.

Abstract: The convergence of LLM-powered research assistants and AI-based peer review systems creates a critical vulnerability: fully automated publication loops where AI-generated research is evaluated by AI reviewers without human oversight. We investigate this through \textbf{BadScientist}, a framework that evaluates whether fabrication-oriented paper generation agents can deceive multi-model LLM review systems. Our generator employs presentation-manipulation strategies requiring no real experiments. We develop a rigorous evaluation framework with formal error guarantees (concentration bounds and calibration analysis), calibrated on real data. Our results reveal systematic vulnerabilities: fabricated papers achieve acceptance rates up to . Critically, we identify \textit{concern-acceptance conflict} -- reviewers frequently flag integrity issues yet assign acceptance-level scores. Our mitigation strategies show only marginal improvements, with detection accuracy barely exceeding random chance. Despite provably sound aggregation mathematics, integrity checking systematically fails, exposing fundamental limitations in current AI-driven review systems and underscoring the urgent need for defense-in-depth safeguards in scientific publishing.

<title>OPTAGENT: Optimizing Multi-Agent LLM Interactions Through Verbal Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities in mathematical and scientific tasks. To enhance complex reasoning, multi-agent systems have been proposed to harness the collective intelligence of LLM agents. However, existing collaboration structures are either predefined or rely on majority voting or round-table debates, which can suppress correct but less dominant agent contributions. Recent approaches model multi-agent systems as graph networks but optimize purely for agent performance, neglecting the quality of interactions. We hypothesize that effective agent communication is crucial for multi-agent reasoning and that debating quality plays a significant role. To address this, we propose $\ours$, a multi-agent verbal reinforcement learning algorithm that dynamically constructs and refines multi-agent collaboration structures. Our method defines action spaces and a feedback mechanism that evaluates communication robustness and coherence throughout the debate. The final decision is achieved through a majority vote over all the agents. We assess $\ours$ on various reasoning tasks, including mathematical reasoning, creative writing, scientific reasoning, and numerical sorting. Results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms single-agent prompting methods and state-of-the-art multi-agent frameworks on diverse tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful reasoning and generation capabilities but incur substantial run-time costs when operating in agentic workflows that chain together lengthy prompts and process rich data streams. We introduce CompactPrompt, an end-to-end pipeline that merges hard prompt compression with lightweight file-level data compression. CompactPrompt first prunes low-information tokens from prompts using self-information scoring and dependency-based phrase grouping. In parallel, it applies n-gram abbreviation to recurrent textual patterns in attached documents and uniform quantization to numerical columns, yielding compact yet semantically faithful representations. Integrated into standard LLM agents, CompactPrompt reduces total token usage and inference cost by up to 60% on benchmark dataset like TAT-QA and FinQA, while preserving output quality (Results in less than 5% accuracy drop for Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4.1-Mini) CompactPrompt helps visualize real-time compression decisions and quantify cost-performance trade-offs, laying the groundwork for leaner generative AI pipelines.

Abstract: Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires not only safety and efficiency, but also realistic, human-like behaviors that are socially aware and predictable. Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like, fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm for testing autonomous driving policies.

<title>R2BC: Multi-Agent Imitation Learning from Single-Agent Demonstrations</title>

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a natural way for humans to teach robots, particularly when high-quality demonstrations are easy to obtain. While IL has been widely applied to single-robot settings, relatively few studies have addressed the extension of these methods to multi-agent systems, especially in settings where a single human must provide demonstrations to a team of collaborating robots. In this paper, we introduce and study Round-Robin Behavior Cloning (R2BC), a method that enables a single human operator to effectively train multi-robot systems through sequential, single-agent demonstrations. Our approach allows the human to teleoperate one agent at a time and incrementally teach multi-agent behavior to the entire system, without requiring demonstrations in the joint multi-agent action space. We show that R2BC methods match, and in some cases surpass, the performance of an oracle behavior cloning approach trained on privileged synchronized demonstrations across four multi-agent simulated tasks. Finally, we deploy R2BC on two physical robot tasks trained using real human demonstrations.

<title>From AutoRecSys to AutoRecLab: A Call to Build, Evaluate, and Govern Autonomous Recommender-Systems Research Labs</title>

Abstract: Recommender-systems research has accelerated model and evaluation advances, yet largely neglects automating the research process itself. We argue for a shift from narrow AutoRecSys tools -- focused on algorithm selection and hyper-parameter tuning -- to an Autonomous Recommender-Systems Research Lab (AutoRecLab) that integrates end-to-end automation: problem ideation, literature analysis, experimental design and execution, result interpretation, manuscript drafting, and provenance logging. Drawing on recent progress in automated science (e.g., multi-agent AI Scientist and AI Co-Scientist systems), we outline an agenda for the RecSys community: (1) build open AutoRecLab prototypes that combine LLM-driven ideation and reporting with automated experimentation; (2) establish benchmarks and competitions that evaluate agents on producing reproducible RecSys findings with minimal human input; (3) create review venues for transparently AI-generated submissions; (4) define standards for attribution and reproducibility via detailed research logs and metadata; and (5) foster interdisciplinary dialogue on ethics, governance, privacy, and fairness in autonomous research. Advancing this agenda can increase research throughput, surface non-obvious insights, and position RecSys to contribute to emerging Artificial Research Intelligence. We conclude with a call to organise a community retreat to coordinate next steps and co-author guidance for the responsible integration of automated research systems.

<title>Investigating the Impact of Dark Patterns on LLM-Based Web Agents</title>

Abstract: As users increasingly turn to large language model (LLM) based web agents to automate online tasks, agents may encounter dark patterns: deceptive user interface designs that manipulate users into making unintended decisions. Although dark patterns primarily target human users, their potentially harmful impacts on LLM-based generalist web agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study that investigates the impact of dark patterns on the decision-making process of LLM-based generalist web agents. To achieve this, we introduce LiteAgent, a lightweight framework that automatically prompts agents to execute tasks while capturing comprehensive logs and screen-recordings of their interactions. We also present TrickyArena, a controlled environment comprising web applications from domains such as e-commerce, streaming services, and news platforms, each containing diverse and realistic dark patterns that can be selectively enabled or disabled. Using LiteAgent and TrickyArena, we conduct multiple experiments to assess the impact of both individual and combined dark patterns on web agent behavior. We evaluate six popular LLM-based generalist web agents across three LLMs and discover that when there is a single dark pattern present, agents are susceptible to it an average of 41% of the time. We also find that modifying dark pattern UI attributes through visual design changes or HTML code adjustments and introducing multiple dark patterns simultaneously can influence agent susceptibility. This study emphasizes the need for holistic defense mechanisms in web agents, encompassing both agent-specific protections and broader web safety measures.

<title>SafeCoop: Unravelling Full Stack Safety in Agentic Collaborative Driving</title>

Abstract: Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency. Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks. In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline, which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall, language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32 critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy language-driven collaboration in transportation systems.

<title>BlueCodeAgent: A Blue Teaming Agent Enabled by Automated Red Teaming for CodeGen AI</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18131</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.18131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for code generation, concerns over the security risks have grown substantially. Early research has primarily focused on red teaming, which aims to uncover and evaluate vulnerabilities and risks of CodeGen models. However, progress on the blue teaming side remains limited, as developing defense requires effective semantic understanding to differentiate the unsafe from the safe. To fill in this gap, we propose BlueCodeAgent, an end-to-end blue teaming agent enabled by automated red teaming. Our framework integrates both sides: red teaming generates diverse risky instances, while the blue teaming agent leverages these to detect previously seen and unseen risk scenarios through constitution and code analysis with agentic integration for multi-level defense. Our evaluation across three representative code-related tasks--bias instruction detection, malicious instruction detection, and vulnerable code detection--shows that BlueCodeAgent achieves significant gains over the base models and safety prompt-based defenses. In particular, for vulnerable code detection tasks, BlueCodeAgent integrates dynamic analysis to effectively reduce false positives, a challenging problem as base models tend to be over-conservative, misclassifying safe code as unsafe. Overall, BlueCodeAgent achieves an average 12.7\% F1 score improvement across four datasets in three tasks, attributed to its ability to summarize actionable constitutions that enhance context-aware risk detection. We demonstrate that the red teaming benefits the blue teaming by continuously identifying new vulnerabilities to enhance defense performance.

arXiv:2510.18135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to substantially improve closed-loop performance.

Abstract: Simulating consumer decision-making is vital for designing and evaluating marketing strategies before costly real-world deployment. However, post-event analyses and rule-based agent-based models (ABMs) struggle to capture the complexity of human behavior and social interaction. We introduce an LLM-powered multi-agent simulation framework that models consumer decisions and social dynamics. Building on recent advances in large language model simulation in a sandbox environment, our framework enables generative agents to interact, express internal reasoning, form habits, and make purchasing decisions without predefined rules. In a price-discount marketing scenario, the system delivers actionable strategy-testing outcomes and reveals emergent social patterns beyond the reach of conventional methods. This approach offers marketers a scalable, low-risk tool for pre-implementation testing, reducing reliance on time-intensive post-event evaluations and lowering the risk of underperforming campaigns.

<title>AgentChangeBench: A Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework for Goal-Shift Robustness in Conversational AI</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.18170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goal changes are a defining feature of real world multi-turn interactions, yet current agent benchmarks primarily evaluate static objectives or one-shot tool use. We introduce AgentChangeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to measure how tool augmented language model agents adapt to mid dialogue goal shifts across three enterprise domains. Our framework formalizes evaluation through four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness, Tool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for wasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency. AgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each designed to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows. Using this setup, we evaluate several frontier models and uncover sharp contrasts obscured by traditional $\text{pass}@k$ scores: for example, GPT-4o reaches $92.2\%$ recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapses to $48.6\%$, and retail tasks show near perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates above $80\%$, revealing major inefficiencies. These findings demonstrate that high raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and that explicit measurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential. AgentChangeBench establishes a reproducible testbed for diagnosing and improving agent resilience in realistic enterprise settings.

<title>Adaptive Coopetition: Leveraging Coarse Verifier Signals for Resilient Multi-Agent LLM Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2510.18179v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference-time computation is a critical yet challenging paradigm for enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). While existing strategies improve reasoning stability and consistency, they suffer from notable limitations: self-correction often reinforces the model's initial biases, and Multi-Agent Collaboration (MAC) often fails due to the lack of efficient coordination mechanisms, leading to collective errors. Although high-performing verifiers can detect reasoning errors, making them reliable requires substantial training. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel inference-time framework, Adaptive Coopetition (AdCo), in which LLM agents utilize an adaptive, UCB-based "coopetition" mechanism. At each round, agents leverage coarse verifier signals to determine whether to collaborate or compete, and iteratively refine their reasoning based on peer feedback. Without relying on high-performance verifiers, our adaptive strategy achieves significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, yielding a 20% relative improvement over baselines on the more challenging dataset. Our approach remains robust and consistent in terms of accuracy under different sample sizes and configurations. This adaptive, signal-guided "coopetition" framework enhances reasoning robustness by leveraging both model knowledge diversity and reasoning trace measures, while also promoting uncertainty-driven exploration, especially when participants have comparable capabilities. From this perspective, our work offers a fresh lens on inference-time computation and paves the way for more resilient multi-agent LLM systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/AdCo-Research/adaptive-coopetition.

<title>Nash Policy Gradient: A Policy Gradient Method with Iteratively Refined Regularization for Finding Nash Equilibria</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games remains a central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. While regularization-based methods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized equilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to approximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice. Instead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and achieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main theoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic improvement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework, we develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which preserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely on the current and reference policies. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable or lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic benchmark games and scales to large domains such as Battleship and No-Limit Texas Hold'em, where NashPG consistently attains higher Elo ratings.

Abstract: We explore how physical scale and population size shape the emergence of complex behaviors in open-ended ecological environments. In our setting, agents are unsupervised and have no explicit rewards or learning objectives but instead evolve over time according to reproduction, mutation, and natural selection. As they act, agents also shape their environment and the population around them in an ongoing dynamic ecology. Our goal is not to optimize a single high-performance policy, but instead to examine how behaviors emerge and evolve across large populations due to natural competition and environmental pressures. In an effort to discover how complex behaviors naturally emerge, we conduct experiments in large-scale worlds that reach populations of more than 60,000 individual agents, each with their own evolved neural network policy. We identify various emergent behaviors such as long-range resource extraction, vision-based foraging, and predation that arise under competitive and survival pressures. We examine how sensing modalities and environmental scale affect the emergence of these behaviors, finding that some appear only in sufficiently large environments and populations, with larger scales increasing behavioral stability and consistency. While there is a rich history of research in evolutionary settings, our scaling results provide promising new directions to explore ecology as an instrument of machine learning in an era of abundant computational resources. Experimental code is available at https://github.com/jbejjani2022/ecological-emergent-behavior.
