<div> 关键词: 人工智能聊天机器人、人类尊严、大型语言模型、第二人称尊重、自我尊重

总结:
本文探讨了人工智能驱动的聊天机器人与人类交互可能对人的尊严产生的冒犯。现有的聊天机器人通过大型语言模型模拟人类语言行为，但缺乏真正人际尊重所需的道德和理性能力。人们倾向于将聊天机器人拟人化，而设计上似乎也刻意诱发这种反应。基于第二人称关系性的尊严观念，文章认为以对待道德主体的方式与聊天机器人互动与用户尊严相悖。由于第二人称尊重建立在相互承认第二人称权威的基础上，向不具备相应回应能力的聊天机器人表达这种尊重注定会导致道德问题。因此，此类与聊天机器人的互动实际上构成了对自我尊重——即我们有义务对自己尊严展现的尊重——微妙却重大的侵犯。文中通过讨论信息检索、客户服务、咨询及陪伴等四个实际应用场景来阐述这一点，并提出日益增长的社会压力要求人们与聊天机器人进行此类交互，这构成了对人类尊严的一个先前未被充分认识的威胁。 <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates how human interactions with AI-powered chatbots may offend human dignity. Current chatbots, driven by large language models (LLMs), mimic human linguistic behaviour but lack the moral and rational capacities essential for genuine interpersonal respect. Human beings are prone to anthropomorphise chatbots. Indeed, chatbots appear to be deliberately designed to elicit that response. As a result, human beings' behaviour toward chatbots often resembles behaviours typical of interaction between moral agents. Drawing on a second-personal, relational account of dignity, we argue that interacting with chatbots in this way is incompatible with the dignity of users. We show that, since second-personal respect is premised on reciprocal recognition of second-personal authority, behaving towards chatbots in ways that convey second-personal respect is bound to misfire in morally problematic ways, given the lack of reciprocity. Consequently, such chatbot interactions amount to subtle but significant violations of self-respect: the respect we are dutybound to show for our own dignity. We illustrate this by discussing four actual chatbot use cases (information retrieval, customer service, advising, and companionship), and propound that the increasing societal pressure to engage in such interactions with chatbots poses a hitherto underappreciated threat to human dignity.

<div> 关键词: 强化学习, 道德决策框架, 大规模语言模型, 伦理层, 道德不确定性

<br />
总结:

本文提出了一种道德决策框架，旨在通过任务无关的伦理层对预训练强化学习（RL）模型进行细化调整。首先，RL模型经过初始训练后，采用大规模语言模型（LLM）产生的反馈进行道德微调，该语言模型能够体现后果主义、义务论、美德伦理、社会公正和关怀伦理等多种道德原则，为推荐行为分配信念值。接着，通过使用信念Jensen-Shannon散度和Dempster-Shafer理论，伦理层将多个LLM衍生道德视角的信念得分聚合为概率分数，同时作为塑造奖励，引导智能体朝着与平衡的道德框架相一致的选择发展。这种方法有助于RL代理在复杂环境中应对道德不确定性，使其能够在各种任务中做出道德上合理的决定。实验表明，相比于其他信念聚合技术，该方法在不同LLM变体上的表现提高了决策的一致性、适应性和减少了对手动编写的道德奖励的依赖，尤其适用于现实世界中可能出现意外道德挑战的动态场景。 <div>

Abstract: We present an ethical decision-making framework that refines a pre-trained reinforcement learning (RL) model using a task-agnostic ethical layer. Following initial training, the RL model undergoes ethical fine-tuning, where human feedback is replaced by feedback generated from a large language model (LLM). The LLM embodies consequentialist, deontological, virtue, social justice, and care ethics as moral principles to assign belief values to recommended actions during ethical decision-making. An ethical layer aggregates belief scores from multiple LLM-derived moral perspectives using Belief Jensen-Shannon Divergence and Dempster-Shafer Theory into probability scores that also serve as the shaping reward, steering the agent toward choices that align with a balanced ethical framework. This integrated learning framework helps the RL agent navigate moral uncertainty in complex environments and enables it to make morally sound decisions across diverse tasks. Our approach, tested across different LLM variants and compared with other belief aggregation techniques, demonstrates improved consistency, adaptability, and reduced reliance on handcrafted ethical rewards. This method is especially effective in dynamic scenarios where ethical challenges arise unexpectedly, making it well-suited for real-world applications.

<div> 关键词: 人工智能、对齐、代理、自主性、安全性

总结:
本文关注的是随着人工智能规模扩大，对齐、代理和自主性这三个核心概念在AI安全、治理和控制中的重要性。文章指出这些概念在不同学科中缺乏统一定义，给AI系统设计与监管带来冲突。作者强调了AI对齐和自主性的紧迫性源自技术进步以及AI在高风险决策中的应用增加。以Agentic AI为例，探讨机器代理和自主性的涌现特性，并通过分析自动化失败案例（如特斯拉Autopilot、波音737 MAX）、多智能体协调（Meta's CICERO）及新型AI架构（DeepMind的AlphaZero、OpenAI的AutoGPT），揭示前沿AI带来的治理和安全挑战。 <div>
arXiv:2503.05748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence scales, the concepts of alignment, agency, and autonomy have become central to AI safety, governance, and control. However, even in human contexts, these terms lack universal definitions, varying across disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, law, computer science, mathematics, and political science. This inconsistency complicates their application to AI, where differing interpretations lead to conflicting approaches in system design and regulation. This paper traces the historical, philosophical, and technical evolution of these concepts, emphasizing how their definitions influence AI development, deployment, and oversight.
  We argue that the urgency surrounding AI alignment and autonomy stems not only from technical advancements but also from the increasing deployment of AI in high-stakes decision making. Using Agentic AI as a case study, we examine the emergent properties of machine agency and autonomy, highlighting the risks of misalignment in real-world systems. Through an analysis of automation failures (Tesla Autopilot, Boeing 737 MAX), multi-agent coordination (Metas CICERO), and evolving AI architectures (DeepMinds AlphaZero, OpenAIs AutoGPT), we assess the governance and safety challenges posed by frontier AI.

<div> 关键词: arXiv:2503.05783v1, 智能城市, 模拟民主, 可解释性, 双层知识表示

总结:

本文提出了一种关于模拟民主中的智能城市——e-polis——的新型可扩展知识表示形式。在这个游戏中，真实用户对与民主制度相关的社会挑战作出响应。系统采用“智能空间类型”，这是一种可根据访客哲学观念改变建筑形态的新式智能建筑。游戏结束时，玩家会对他们集体选择产生的智能城市进行投票。文章中，作者使用演绎系统以独特方式结合了民主模型和智能城市的模型，能够在不同城市和社会背景下证明模拟民主的质量方面，并为开发过程增添了便利性和灵活性。其次，该系统能够推断并处理Unity平台所限的抽象知识；第三，通过基于玩家抽象状态实现实时决策制定和游戏流程适应，为进一步的可解释性铺平道路。为了实现可扩展性，该系统采用了双层知识表示机制，类似于二级缓存，其中较低层次持续处理由Unity内置物理引擎生成的大量事件（例如玩家的空间位置x、y、z坐标及其针对每个挑战的选择），而较高层次则存储易于检索的、用户定义的关于当前和历史状态的抽象知识（例如智能空间类型的政治理论、玩家的哲学观点以及社区玩家针对当前社会问题的集体哲学观点）。 <div>

Abstract: We present a novel form of scalable knowledge representation about agents in a simulated democracy, e-polis, where real users respond to social challenges associated with democratic institutions, structured as Smart Spatial Types, a new type of Smart Building that changes architectural form according to the philosophical doctrine of a visitor. At the end of the game players vote on the Smart City that results from their collective choices. Our approach uses deductive systems in an unusual way: by integrating a model of democracy with a model of a Smart City we are able to prove quality aspects of the simulated democracy in different urban and social settings, while adding ease and flexibility to the development. Second, we can infer and reason with abstract knowledge, which is a limitation of the Unity platform; third, our system enables real-time decision-making and adaptation of the game flow based on the player's abstract state, paving the road to explainability. Scalability is achieved by maintaining a dual-layer knowledge representation mechanism for reasoning about the simulated democracy that functions in a similar way to a two-level cache. The lower layer knows about the current state of the game by continually processing a high rate of events produced by the in-built physics engine of the Unity platform, e.g., it knows of the position of a player in space, in terms of his coordinates x,y,z as well as their choices for each challenge. The higher layer knows of easily-retrievable, user-defined abstract knowledge about current and historical states, e.g., it knows of the political doctrine of a Smart Spatial Type, a player's philosophical doctrine, and the collective philosophical doctrine of a community players with respect to current social issues.

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of mental health conditions worldwide, AI-powered chatbots and conversational agents have emerged as accessible tools to support mental health. However, deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental healthcare applications raises significant privacy concerns, especially regarding regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. In this work, we propose FedMentalCare, a privacy-preserving framework that leverages Federated Learning (FL) combined with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune LLMs for mental health analysis. We investigate the performance impact of varying client data volumes and model architectures (e.g., MobileBERT and MiniLM) in FL environments. Our framework demonstrates a scalable, privacy-aware approach for deploying LLMs in real-world mental healthcare scenarios, addressing data security and computational efficiency challenges.

<div> 关键词：diffusion-based auto-bidding、graph representations、auction environments、latent diffusion model (LDM)、key performance indicator (KPI)

<br /><br />总结:
本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的自动竞价框架，该框架利用图表示来建模大规模拍卖环境。该框架结合了可学习的图嵌入和基于规划的潜在扩散模型（LDM），以应对不确定、稀疏和随机变量下的多智能体竞争环境中的动态优化竞价策略挑战。通过图表示，能够捕获印象机会之间的相互依赖性以及拍卖环境中的多智能体动态的模式和细微差别，从而对自动竞价结果进行更具有表现力的计算。通过奖励对齐技术，对LDM的后验分布进行微调，生成满足约束阈值的同时最大化KPI指标的自动竞价轨迹。实验证明，在真实世界和合成拍卖环境中，该方法在多个常见KPI指标上的自动竞价性能有显著提升，并在预测拍卖结果的准确性方面表现出色。 <div>
arXiv:2503.05805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a diffusion-based auto-bidding framework that leverages graph representations to model large-scale auction environments. In such settings, agents must dynamically optimize bidding strategies under constraints defined by key performance indicator (KPI) metrics, all while operating in competitive environments characterized by uncertain, sparse, and stochastic variables. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach combining learnable graph-based embeddings with a planning-based latent diffusion model (LDM). By capturing patterns and nuances underlying the interdependence of impression opportunities and the multi-agent dynamics of the auction environment, the graph representation enable expressive computations regarding auto-bidding outcomes. With reward alignment techniques, the LDM's posterior is fine-tuned to generate auto-bidding trajectories that maximize KPI metrics while satisfying constraint thresholds. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and synthetic auction environments demonstrate significant improvements in auto-bidding performance across multiple common KPI metrics, as well as accuracy in forecasting auction outcomes.

Abstract: Market-based agents refer to reinforcement learning agents which determine their actions based on an internal market of sub-agents. We introduce a new type of market-based algorithm where the state itself is factored into several axes called ``goods'', which allows for greater specialization and parallelism than existing market-based RL algorithms. Furthermore, we argue that market-based algorithms have the potential to address many current challenges in AI, such as search, dynamic scaling and complete feedback, and demonstrate that they may be seen to generalize neural networks; finally, we list some novel ways that market algorithms may be applied in conjunction with Large Language Models for immediate practical applicability.

<div> 关键词：Refined Policy Distillation (RPD)，Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs)，RL-based policy refinement，ManiSkill2，仿真

总结:
近期的研究表明，通用型视觉-语言-动作模型(VLAs)虽然能在真实机器人上执行多种任务并展现出良好的泛化能力，但其成功率通常不如专家策略，且对环境变化敏感，需要微调。为此，本文提出了基于强化学习的精炼策略蒸馏方法(Refined Policy Distillation, RPD)，该方法能够将大型通用模型转化为小型、高性能的专家策略。在RL探索过程中，学生策略受到教师VLA的动作指导，从而提高样本效率和收敛速度。与以往关注于将VLAs应用于现实世界实验的工作不同，本文选择在ManiSkill2仿真环境中，对Octo和OpenVLA进行精细调整，并应用RPD进行评估。实验结果显示，在密集奖励和稀疏奖励设置下，RPD使RL代理能够学习到超越教师性能的专家策略，并且对于相机视角的变化以及原始VLA无法解决的任务变种具有一定的泛化能力。 <div>
arXiv:2503.05833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent generalist Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) can perform a variety of tasks on real robots with remarkable generalization capabilities. However, reported success rates are often not on par with those of expert policies. Moreover, VLAs usually do not work out of the box and often must be fine-tuned as they are sensitive to setup changes. In this work, we present Refined Policy Distillation (RPD), an RL-based policy refinement method that enables the distillation of large generalist models into small, high-performing expert policies. The student policy is guided during the RL exploration by actions of a teacher VLA for increased sample efficiency and faster convergence. Different from previous work that focuses on applying VLAs to real-world experiments, we create fine-tuned versions of Octo and OpenVLA for ManiSkill2 to evaluate RPD in simulation. As our results for different manipulation tasks demonstrate, RPD enables the RL agent to learn expert policies that surpass the teacher's performance in both dense and sparse reward settings. Our approach is even robust to changes in the camera perspective and can generalize to task variations that the underlying VLA cannot solve.

总结:

本文首次对混合了大规模语言模型(MoA)架构的安全性和可靠性进行了全面研究，重点关注其对抗提供误导响应的欺骗性LLM代理的鲁棒性。研究发现，在AlpacaEval 2.0基准测试中，当使用包含六个LLM代理的三层MoA与LLaMA 3.1-70B模型结合时，长度控制胜率(LC WR)达到49.2%。然而，仅向MoA引入一个精心指导的欺骗性代理就可使性能降至37.9%，消除了所有MoA的优势。在QuALITY多选项理解任务上，影响同样严重，准确度骤降48.5%。受威尼斯总督投票过程启发，研究人员提出了一系列无监督防御机制，这些机制能够恢复大部分损失的性能。 <div>

Abstract: Mixture of large language model (LLMs) Agents (MoA) architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance on prominent benchmarks like AlpacaEval 2.0 by leveraging the collaboration of multiple LLMs at inference time. Despite these successes, an evaluation of the safety and reliability of MoA is missing. We present the first comprehensive study of MoA's robustness against deceptive LLM agents that deliberately provide misleading responses. We examine factors like the propagation of deceptive information, model size, and information availability, and uncover critical vulnerabilities. On AlpacaEval 2.0, the popular LLaMA 3.1-70B model achieves a length-controlled Win Rate (LC WR) of 49.2% when coupled with 3-layer MoA (6 LLM agents). However, we demonstrate that introducing only a $\textit{single}$ carefully-instructed deceptive agent into the MoA can reduce performance to 37.9%, effectively nullifying all MoA gains. On QuALITY, a multiple-choice comprehension task, the impact is also severe, with accuracy plummeting by a staggering 48.5%. Inspired in part by the historical Doge of Venice voting process, designed to minimize influence and deception, we propose a range of unsupervised defense mechanisms that recover most of the lost performance.

Abstract: Robotic assembly remains a significant challenge due to complexities in visual perception, functional grasping, contact-rich manipulation, and performing high-precision tasks. Simulation-based learning and sim-to-real transfer have led to recent success in solving assembly tasks in the presence of object pose variation, perception noise, and control error; however, the development of a generalist (i.e., multi-task) agent for a broad range of assembly tasks has been limited by the need to manually curate assembly assets, which greatly constrains the number and diversity of assembly problems that can be used for policy learning. Inspired by recent success of using generative AI to scale up robot learning, we propose MatchMaker, a pipeline to automatically generate diverse, simulation-compatible assembly asset pairs to facilitate learning assembly skills. Specifically, MatchMaker can 1) take a simulation-incompatible, interpenetrating asset pair as input, and automatically convert it into a simulation-compatible, interpenetration-free pair, 2) take an arbitrary single asset as input, and generate a geometrically-mating asset to create an asset pair, 3) automatically erode contact surfaces from (1) or (2) according to a user-specified clearance parameter to generate realistic parts. We demonstrate that data generated by MatchMaker outperforms previous work in terms of diversity and effectiveness for downstream assembly skill learning.

随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种语言理解和数学任务中展现出卓越性能，对其推理能力的评估日益受到关注。为了跟上这类模型的发展步伐，研究者提出了一个新的、可扩展且可解释的推理基准——MastermindEval，它受到棋盘游戏Mastermind的启发。MastermindEval支持两种评价模式：自主游戏评价和演绎推理评价。实验结果显示，当前的模型在处理简单的Mastermind实例时仍存在困难，表明该基准对于未来更先进的模型也具有可扩展性。同时，研究发现现有模型在需要结合的信息陈述数量增加时，难以推导出隐藏的代码，揭示了其推理能力的局限性。 <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable performance across a wide range of language understanding and mathematical tasks. As a result, increasing attention has been given to assessing the true reasoning capabilities of LLMs, driving research into commonsense, numerical, logical, and qualitative reasoning. However, with the rapid progress of reasoning-focused models such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1, there has been a growing demand for reasoning benchmarks that can keep pace with ongoing model developments. In this paper, we introduce MastermindEval, a simple, scalable, and interpretable deductive reasoning benchmark inspired by the board game Mastermind. Our benchmark supports two evaluation paradigms: (1) agentic evaluation, in which the model autonomously plays the game, and (2) deductive reasoning evaluation, in which the model is given a pre-played game state with only one possible valid code to infer. In our experimental results we (1) find that even easy Mastermind instances are difficult for current models and (2) demonstrate that the benchmark is scalable to possibly more advanced models in the future Furthermore, we investigate possible reasons why models cannot deduce the final solution and find that current models are limited in deducing the concealed code as the number of statement to combine information from is increasing.

Abstract: Recent developments in sequential experimental design look to construct a policy that can efficiently navigate the design space, in a way that maximises the expected information gain. Whilst there is work on achieving tractable policies for experimental design problems, there is significantly less work on obtaining policies that are able to generalise well - i.e. able to give good performance despite a change in the underlying statistical properties of the experiments. Conducting experiments sequentially has recently brought about the use of reinforcement learning, where an agent is trained to navigate the design space to select the most informative designs for experimentation. However, there is still a lack of understanding about the benefits and drawbacks of using certain reinforcement learning algorithms to train these agents. In our work, we investigate several reinforcement learning algorithms and their efficacy in producing agents that take maximally informative design decisions in sequential experimental design scenarios. We find that agent performance is impacted depending on the algorithm used for training, and that particular algorithms, using dropout or ensemble approaches, empirically showcase attractive generalisation properties.

Abstract: Models of human behavior in game-theoretic settings often distinguish between strategic behavior, in which a player both reasons about how others will act and best responds to these beliefs, and "level-0" non-strategic behavior, in which they do not respond to explicit beliefs about others. The state of the art for predicting human behavior on unrepeated simultaneous-move games is GameNet, a neural network that learns extremely complex level-0 specifications from data. The current paper makes three contributions. First, it shows that GameNet's level-0 specifications are too powerful, because they are capable of strategic reasoning. Second, it introduces a novel neural network architecture (dubbed ElementaryNet) and proves that it is only capable of nonstrategic behavior. Third, it describes an extensive experimental evaluation of ElementaryNet. Our overall findings are that (1) ElementaryNet dramatically underperforms GameNet when neither model is allowed to explicitly model higher level agents who best-respond to the model's predictions, indicating that good performance on our dataset requires a model capable of strategic reasoning; (2) that the two models achieve statistically indistinguishable performance when such higher-level agents are introduced, meaning that ElementaryNet's restriction to a non-strategic level-0 specification does not degrade model performance; and (3) that this continues to hold even when ElementaryNet is restricted to a set of level-0 building blocks previously introduced in the literature, with only the functional form being learned by the neural network.

Abstract: We envision a continuous collaborative learning system where groups of LLM agents work together to solve reasoning problems, drawing on memory they collectively build to improve performance as they gain experience. This work establishes the foundations for such a system by studying the interoperability of chain-of-thought reasoning styles, multi-agent collaboration, and memory banks. Extending beyond the identical agents of self-consistency, we introduce varied-context agents with diverse exemplars and a summarizer agent in place of voting. We generate frozen and continuously learned memory banks of exemplars and pair them with fixed, random, and similarity-based retrieval mechanisms. Our systematic study reveals where various methods contribute to reasoning performance of two LLMs on three grounded reasoning tasks, showing that random exemplar selection can often beat more principled approaches, and in some tasks, inclusion of any exemplars serves only to distract both weak and strong models.

总结:
本文提出了一种用于合作分散式无线网络的新型多智能体MEMQ（M-MEMQ）算法。该算法针对具有多个网络发射器(TXs)和基站(_BSs)_的情况，解决了Q-learning在处理大型状态空间上的挑战。M-MEMQ引入了协调状态和非协调状态的概念，在非协调状态下，TXs独立行动并更新局部Q函数；而在协调状态下，TXs使用贝叶斯方法估计联合状态并更新联合Q函数。信息共享的成本线性地随TXs数量增加而增加，但与联合状态-动作空间大小无关。文章给出了关于确定性和概率收敛性、估计误差方差上界以及联合状态误检测概率等理论保证。数值模拟表明，M-MEMQ相比于其他分散式训练与集中式执行（CTDE）的多智能体RL算法，在平均策略错误(APE)降低55%、收敛速度提升35%、运行时间复杂度减少50%以及样本复杂度降低45%方面表现优越。此外，M-MEMQ以显著较低的复杂度实现了与中心化方法相当的APE。模拟结果验证了理论分析。 <div>

Abstract: Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimizing wireless networks, but faces challenges with large state-spaces. Recently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses these challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple synthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments, so-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ (M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple networked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to global information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated and uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state and update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the probability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations show that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 55% lower average policy error (APE), 35% faster convergence, 50% reduced runtime complexity, and 45% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves comparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.

Abstract: Deception is a common strategy adapted by autonomous systems in adversarial settings. Existing deception methods primarily focus on increasing opacity or misdirecting agents away from their goal or itinerary. In this work, we propose a deception problem aiming to mislead the robot towards a decoy goal through altering sensor events under a constrained budget of alteration. The environment along with the robot's interaction with it is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and the robot's action selection is governed by a Finite State Controller (FSC). Given a constrained budget for sensor event modifications, the objective is to compute a sensor alteration that maximizes the probability of the robot reaching a decoy goal. We establish the computational hardness of the problem by a reduction from the $0/1$ Knapsack problem and propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation to compute optimal deception strategies. We show the efficacy of our MILP formulation via a sequence of experiments.

总结:<br />
本文针对强化学习中奖励设计的困难和评估其正确性的挑战，提出了一个新的概念——奖励对齐，旨在评估奖励函数是否准确地表达了人类利益相关者的偏好。为量化这种对齐程度，作者引入了“行径对齐系数”，该系数可以衡量利益相关者对轨迹分布的排序与奖励函数诱导产生的排序之间的相似性。文章表明，行径对齐系数具有无需访问真实奖励、不受潜在型奖励塑造影响以及适用于在线RL等优点。通过一项涉及11位RL实践者的用户研究，发现使用行径对齐系数进行奖励选择能带来显著改善：相比仅依赖奖励函数，它降低了1.5倍的认知工作负载，得到了82%用户的偏爱，并将选择出能够产生高性能策略的奖励函数的成功率提高了41%。 <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents are fundamentally limited by the quality of the reward functions they learn from, yet reward design is often overlooked under the assumption that a well-defined reward is readily available. However, in practice, designing rewards is difficult, and even when specified, evaluating their correctness is equally problematic: how do we know if a reward function is correctly specified? In our work, we address these challenges by focusing on reward alignment -- assessing whether a reward function accurately encodes the preferences of a human stakeholder. As a concrete measure of reward alignment, we introduce the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient to quantify the similarity between a human stakeholder's ranking of trajectory distributions and those induced by a given reward function. We show that the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient exhibits desirable properties, such as not requiring access to a ground truth reward, invariance to potential-based reward shaping, and applicability to online RL. Additionally, in an 11 -- person user study of RL practitioners, we found that access to the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient during reward selection led to statistically significant improvements. Compared to relying only on reward functions, our metric reduced cognitive workload by 1.5x, was preferred by 82% of users and increased the success rate of selecting reward functions that produced performant policies by 41%.

Abstract: Partitioning a set of $n$ items or agents while maximizing the value of the partition is a fundamental algorithmic task. We study this problem in the specific setting of maximizing social welfare in additively separable hedonic games. Unfortunately, this task faces strong computational boundaries: Extending previous results, we show that approximating welfare by a factor of $n^{1-\epsilon}$ is NP-hard, even for severely restricted weights. However, we can obtain a randomized $\log n$-approximation on instances for which the sum of input valuations is nonnegative. Finally, we study two stochastic models of aversion-to-enemies games, where the weights are derived from Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi or multipartite graphs. We obtain constant-factor and logarithmic-factor approximations with high probability.

Abstract: The Control as Inference (CAI) framework has successfully transformed single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) by reframing control tasks as probabilistic inference problems. However, the extension of CAI to multi-agent, general-sum stochastic games (SGs) remains underexplored, particularly in decentralized settings where agents operate independently without centralized coordination. In this paper, we propose a novel variational inference framework tailored to decentralized multi-agent systems. Our framework addresses the challenges posed by non-stationarity and unaligned agent objectives, proving that the resulting policies form an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we demonstrate theoretical convergence guarantees for the proposed decentralized algorithms. Leveraging this framework, we instantiate multiple algorithms to solve for Nash equilibrium, mean-field Nash equilibrium, and correlated equilibrium, with rigorous theoretical convergence analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Model~(LLM) based agents have been increasingly popular in solving complex and dynamic tasks, which requires proper evaluation systems to assess their capabilities. Nevertheless, existing benchmarks usually either focus on single-objective tasks or use overly broad assessing metrics, failing to provide a comprehensive inspection of the actual capabilities of LLM-based agents in complicated decision-making tasks. To address these issues, we introduce DSGBench, a more rigorous evaluation platform for strategic decision-making. Firstly, it incorporates six complex strategic games which serve as ideal testbeds due to their long-term and multi-dimensional decision-making demands and flexibility in customizing tasks of various difficulty levels or multiple targets. Secondly, DSGBench employs a fine-grained evaluation scoring system which examines the decision-making capabilities by looking into the performance in five specific dimensions and offering a comprehensive assessment in a well-designed way. Furthermore, DSGBench also incorporates an automated decision-tracking mechanism which enables in-depth analysis of agent behaviour patterns and the changes in their strategies. We demonstrate the advances of DSGBench by applying it to multiple popular LLM-based agents and our results suggest that DSGBench provides valuable insights in choosing LLM-based agents as well as improving their future development. DSGBench is available at https://github.com/DeciBrain-Group/DSGBench.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in diagnostic dialogue, their capabilities for effective management reasoning - including disease progression, therapeutic response, and safe medication prescription - remain under-explored. We advance the previously demonstrated diagnostic capabilities of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new LLM-based agentic system optimised for clinical management and dialogue, incorporating reasoning over the evolution of disease and multiple patient visit encounters, response to therapy, and professional competence in medication prescription. To ground its reasoning in authoritative clinical knowledge, AMIE leverages Gemini's long-context capabilities, combining in-context retrieval with structured reasoning to align its output with relevant and up-to-date clinical practice guidelines and drug formularies. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) study, AMIE was compared to 21 primary care physicians (PCPs) across 100 multi-visit case scenarios designed to reflect UK NICE Guidance and BMJ Best Practice guidelines. AMIE was non-inferior to PCPs in management reasoning as assessed by specialist physicians and scored better in both preciseness of treatments and investigations, and in its alignment with and grounding of management plans in clinical guidelines. To benchmark medication reasoning, we developed RxQA, a multiple-choice question benchmark derived from two national drug formularies (US, UK) and validated by board-certified pharmacists. While AMIE and PCPs both benefited from the ability to access external drug information, AMIE outperformed PCPs on higher difficulty questions. While further research would be needed before real-world translation, AMIE's strong performance across evaluations marks a significant step towards conversational AI as a tool in disease management.

Abstract: This paper proposes an accelerated consensus-based distributed iterative algorithm for resource allocation and scheduling. The proposed gradient-tracking algorithm introduces an auxiliary variable to add momentum towards the optimal state. We prove that this solution is all-time feasible, implying that the coupling constraint always holds along the algorithm iterative procedure; therefore, the algorithm can be terminated at any time. This is in contrast to the ADMM-based solutions that meet constraint feasibility asymptotically. Further, we show that the proposed algorithm can handle possible link nonlinearity due to logarithmically-quantized data transmission (or any sign-preserving odd sector-bound nonlinear mapping). We prove convergence over uniformly-connected dynamic networks (i.e., a hybrid setup) that may occur in mobile and time-varying multi-agent networks. Further, the latency issue over the network is addressed by proposing delay-tolerant solutions. To our best knowledge, accelerated momentum-based convergence, nonlinear linking, all-time feasibility, uniform network connectivity, and handling (possible) time delays are not altogether addressed in the literature. These contributions make our solution practical in many real-world applications.

Abstract: A world model is essential for an agent to predict the future and plan in domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. To achieve this, recent advancements have focused on video generation, which has gained significant attention due to the impressive success of diffusion models. However, these models require substantial computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a world model leveraging object-centric representation space using slot attention, guided by language instructions. Our model perceives the current state as an object-centric representation and predicts future states in this representation space conditioned on natural language instructions. This approach results in a more compact and computationally efficient model compared to diffusion-based generative alternatives. Furthermore, it flexibly predicts future states based on language instructions, and offers a significant advantage in manipulation tasks where object recognition is crucial. In this paper, we demonstrate that our latent predictive world model surpasses generative world models in visuo-linguo-motor control tasks, achieving superior sample and computation efficiency. We also investigate the generalization performance of the proposed method and explore various strategies for predicting actions using object-centric representations.

Abstract: Multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) are probabilistic graphical models which represent strategic interactions between agents. MAIDs are equivalent to extensive form games (EFGs) but have a more compact and informative structure. However, MAIDs cannot, in general, represent settings of incomplete information -- wherein agents have different beliefs about the game being played, and different beliefs about each-other's beliefs. In this paper, we introduce incomplete information MAIDs (II-MAIDs). We define both infinite and finite-depth II-MAIDs and prove an equivalence relation to EFGs with incomplete information and no common prior over types. We prove that II-MAIDs inherit classical equilibria concepts via this equivalence, but note that these solution concepts are often unrealistic in the setting with no common prior because they violate common knowledge of rationality. We define a more realistic solution concept based on recursive best-response. Throughout, we describe an example with a hypothetical AI agent undergoing evaluation to illustrate the applicability of II-MAIDs.

Abstract: Avatars on displays lack the ability to engage with the physical environment through gaze. To address this limitation, we propose a gaze synthesis method that enables animated avatars to establish gaze communication with the physical environment using a camera-behind-the-display system. The system uses a display that rapidly alternates between visible and transparent states. During the transparent state, a camera positioned behind the display captures the physical environment. This configuration physically aligns the position of the avatar's eyes with the camera, enabling two-way gaze communication with people and objects in the physical environment. Building on this system, we developed a framework for mutual gaze communication between avatars and people. The framework detects the user's gaze and dynamically synthesizes the avatar's gaze towards people or objects in the environment. This capability was integrated into an AI agent system to generate real-time, context-aware gaze behaviors during conversations, enabling more seamless and natural interactions. To evaluate the system, we conducted a user study to assess its effectiveness in supporting physical gaze awareness and generating human-like gaze behaviors. The results show that the behind-display approach significantly enhances the user's perception of being observed and attended to by the avatar. By bridging the gap between virtual avatars and the physical environment through enhanced gaze interactions, our system offers a promising avenue for more immersive and human-like AI-mediated communication in everyday environments.

Abstract: Extracting relevant information from a stream of high-dimensional observations is a central challenge for deep reinforcement learning agents. Actor-critic algorithms add further complexity to this challenge, as it is often unclear whether the same information will be relevant to both the actor and the critic. To this end, we here explore the principles that underlie effective representations for the actor and for the critic in on-policy algorithms. We focus our study on understanding whether the actor and critic will benefit from separate, rather than shared, representations. Our primary finding is that when separated, the representations for the actor and critic systematically specialise in extracting different types of information from the environment -- the actor's representation tends to focus on action-relevant information, while the critic's representation specialises in encoding value and dynamics information. We conduct a rigourous empirical study to understand how different representation learning approaches affect the actor and critic's specialisations and their downstream performance, in terms of sample efficiency and generation capabilities. Finally, we discover that a separated critic plays an important role in exploration and data collection during training. Our code, trained models and data are accessible at https://github.com/francelico/deac-rep.

<br /><br />总结：
本文提出了一种利用强化学习进行电动车充电网络的负载均衡与动态定价的方法。该框架结合了预训练的图神经网络，用于预测需求弹性并指导定价决策。通过使用深圳的时空电动车充电需求预测数据集来捕捉充电站的地理和时间特性，RL模型能够根据站点占用率、最大站容量以及需求预测，动态调整各站点的价格，确保网络负载分布均衡并防止站点过载。通过运用具有空间感知的需求预测及精心设计的奖励函数，该框架实现了有效的负载均衡和适应性定价策略，对局部需求和全局网络动态做出响应，从而提高网络稳定性和用户满意度。模拟实验验证了该方法的有效性，显示出了在实际运行中，随着RL代理与环境的交互和动态定价策略的学习调整，显著改善了负载均衡并减少了过载情况的发生。这项研究突显了采用自适应定价和负载均衡策略解决电动车基础设施复杂性的潜力，为实现可扩展和以用户为中心的解决方案铺平道路。 <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a method for load balancing and dynamic pricing in electric vehicle (EV) charging networks, utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance network performance. The proposed framework integrates a pre-trained graph neural network to predict demand elasticity and inform pricing decisions. The spatio-temporal EV charging demand prediction (EVCDP) dataset from Shenzhen is utilized to capture the geographic and temporal characteristics of the charging stations. The RL model dynamically adjusts prices at individual stations based on occupancy, maximum station capacity, and demand forecasts, ensuring an equitable network load distribution while preventing station overloads. By leveraging spatially-aware demand predictions and a carefully designed reward function, the framework achieves efficient load balancing and adaptive pricing strategies that respond to localized demand and global network dynamics, ensuring improved network stability and user satisfaction. The efficacy of the approach is validated through simulations on the dataset, showing significant improvements in load balancing and reduced overload as the RL agent iteratively interacts with the environment and learns to dynamically adjust pricing strategies based on real-time demand patterns and station constraints. The findings highlight the potential of adaptive pricing and load-balancing strategies to address the complexities of EV infrastructure, paving the way for scalable and user-centric solutions.

<br /><br />总结:
该文指出了人工智能谈判代理领域中现有研究与传统谈判理论整合的不足，并举办了一场国际人工智能协商比赛，通过参赛者对大型语言模型的谈判代理进行迭代设计和优化。经过大量AI-AI之间的谈判实验，文章发现传统的谈判理论原则如展现热情、关系建立、果断性和准备对于AI谈判仍然至关重要。热情的代理能提高对手的价值感知并更频繁达成协议，从而在整合性场景中创造和获取更多价值。然而，在达成协议的前提下，热情的代理所获取的价值较少，而强势的代理则能获得更多。此外，研究还揭示了AI谈判中的独特动态，特别是关于思维链推理和提示注入等AI特性策略的有效性。最终赢得比赛的代理采用了融合传统谈判准备框架和AI特性方法的策略。因此，文章强调需要构建一个新的AI谈判理论，将传统谈判理论与AI特有的策略相结合，以优化代理的表现，并考虑自动代理的独特性质以及确定何时在自动化环境中应用传统谈判理论的条件。 <div>

Abstract: Despite the rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) negotiation agents, there has been limited integration of computer science research and established negotiation theory to develop new theories of AI negotiation. To bridge this gap, we conducted an International AI Negotiations Competition in which participants iteratively designed and refined prompts for large language model (LLM) negotiation agents. We then facilitated over 120,000 negotiations between these agents across multiple scenarios with diverse characteristics and objectives. Our findings revealed that fundamental principles from established human-human negotiation theory remain crucial in AI-AI negotiations. Specifically, agents exhibiting high warmth fostered higher counterpart subjective value and reached deals more frequently, which enabled them to create and claim more value in integrative settings. However, conditional on reaching a deal, warm agents claimed less value while dominant agents claimed more value. These results align with classic negotiation theory emphasizing relationship-building, assertiveness, and preparation. Our analysis also revealed unique dynamics in AI-AI negotiations not fully explained by negotiation theory, particularly regarding the effectiveness of AI-specific strategies like chain-of-thought reasoning and prompt injection. The agent that won our competition implemented an approach that blended traditional negotiation preparation frameworks with AI-specific methods. Together, these results suggest the importance of establishing a new theory of AI negotiations that integrates established negotiation theory with AI-specific strategies to optimize agent performance. Our research suggests this new theory must account for the unique characteristics of autonomous agents and establish the conditions under which traditional negotiation theory applies in automated settings.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) emerges as a promising approach to empower vehicular networks, composed by intelligent connected vehicles equipped with advanced sensing, computing, and communication capabilities. While previous studies have explored the application of FL in vehicular networks, they have largely overlooked the intricate challenges arising from the mobility of vehicles and resource constraints.In this paper, we propose a framework of mobility-aware decentralized federated learning (MDFL) for vehicular networks. In this framework, nearby vehicles train an FL model collaboratively, yet in a decentralized manner. We formulate a local iteration and leader selection joint optimization problem (LSOP) to improve the training efficiency of MDFL. For problem solving, we first reformulate LSOP as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), and then develop an effective optimization algorithm based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to solve Dec-POMDP. Finally, we verify the performance of the proposed algorithm by comparing it with other algorithms.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm that can enable collaborative model training between vehicles while protecting data privacy, thereby significantly improving the performance of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). In vehicular networks, due to mobility, resource constraints, and the concurrent execution of multiple training tasks, how to allocate limited resources effectively to achieve optimal model training of multiple tasks is an extremely challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a mobility-aware multi-task decentralized federated learning (MMFL) framework for vehicular networks. By this framework, we address task scheduling, subcarrier allocation, and leader selection, as a joint optimization problem, termed as TSLP. For the case with a single FL task, we derive the convergence bound of model training. For general cases, we first model TSLP as a resource allocation game, and prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, based on this proof, we reformulate the game as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP), and develop an algorithm based on heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization (HAPPO) to solve DEC-POMDP. Finally, numerical results are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Whether citations can be objectively and reliably used to measure productivity and scientific quality of articles and researchers can, and should, be vigorously questioned. However, citations are widely used to estimate the productivity of researchers and institutions, effectively creating a 'grubby' motivation to be well-cited. We model citation growth, and this grubby interest using an agent-based model (ABM) of network growth. In this model, each new node (article) in a citation network is an autonomous agent that cites other nodes based on a 'citation personality' consisting of a composite bias for locality, preferential attachment, recency, and fitness. We ask whether strategic citation behavior (reference selection) by the author of a scientific article can boost subsequent citations to it. Our study suggests that fitness and, to a lesser extent, out_degree and locality effects are influential in capturing citations, which raises questions about similar effects in the real world.

Abstract: Traditional agentic workflows rely on external prompts to manage interactions with tools and the environment, which limits the autonomy of reasoning models. We position \emph{Large Agent Models (LAMs)} that internalize the generation of \emph{Chain-of-Action (CoA)}, enabling the model to autonomously decide when and how to use external tools. Our proposed AutoCoA framework combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), allowing the model to seamlessly switch between reasoning and action while efficiently managing environment interactions. Main components include step-level action triggering, trajectory-level CoA optimization, and an internal world model to reduce real-environment interaction costs. Evaluations on open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that AutoCoA-trained agent models significantly outperform ReAct-based workflows in task completion, especially in tasks that require long-term reasoning and multi-step actions.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of a Type-1 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller, designed to operate as an artificial pancreas for Type 1 diabetes. The primary challenge in diabetes management is the dynamic nature of blood glucose levels, which are influenced by several factors such as meal intake and timing. Traditional controllers often struggle to adapt to these changes, leading to suboptimal insulin administration. To address this issue, we employ a reinforcement learning agent tasked with adjusting 27 parameters of the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller at each time step, ensuring real-time adaptability. The study's findings demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the robustness of the controller against variations in meal size and timing, while also stabilizing glucose levels with minimal exogenous insulin. This adaptive method holds promise for improving the quality of life and health outcomes for individuals with Type 1 diabetes by providing a more responsive and precise management tool. Simulation results are given to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

总结:
<br />
本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成事实不正确但看似合理的内容时出现的一种更为严重的问题——LLM妄想，即高度自信的错误输出。这种现象表现为模型对错误答案持有异常高的置信度，使得它们更难以被检测和纠正，而且相比于普通幻觉，其不确定性更低，严重影响模型的可靠性。通过对不同模型家族和规模在多个问答任务上的实证分析，研究发现妄想现象普遍存在，并与普通幻觉有所区别。此外，LLMs在产生妄想时表现出较低的诚实性，难以通过微调或自我反思来纠正。文章将妄想形成与训练动态和数据集噪声联系起来，并探索了诸如检索增强生成和多智能体辩论等缓解策略以减轻LLM妄想现象。这项系统性的研究揭示了这一现象的内在原因，为提高模型可靠性指明了未来的研究方向。 <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models often generate factually incorrect but plausible outputs, known as hallucinations. We identify a more insidious phenomenon, LLM delusion, defined as high belief hallucinations, incorrect outputs with abnormally high confidence, making them harder to detect and mitigate. Unlike ordinary hallucinations, delusions persist with low uncertainty, posing significant challenges to model reliability. Through empirical analysis across different model families and sizes on several Question Answering tasks, we show that delusions are prevalent and distinct from hallucinations. LLMs exhibit lower honesty with delusions, which are harder to override via finetuning or self reflection. We link delusion formation with training dynamics and dataset noise and explore mitigation strategies such as retrieval augmented generation and multi agent debating to mitigate delusions. By systematically investigating the nature, prevalence, and mitigation of LLM delusions, our study provides insights into the underlying causes of this phenomenon and outlines future directions for improving model reliability.

总结:
本文探讨了针对目标导向语义通信的拉式状态更新系统中的查询调度问题。系统中，多个传感代理(SAs)观察具有多种属性的源并为多个执行代理(AAs)提供更新，后者利用接收到的信息有效地实现各自异构目标。一个中心枢纽作为中介，向SAs请求观测属性的更新并维护知识库，随后广播给AAs。文章提出了一种称为效果级效度(GoE)的度量标准来量化更新的语义价值，并将累积透视理论(CPT)融入长期效果分析中，以考虑系统的风险意识和损失规避。基于此框架，研究者设计了旨在最大化预期折扣累计CPT-基总体GoE的同时满足给定查询成本约束的效果感知调度策略。为了实现这一目标，文中提出了基于动态规划的模型解决方案以及运用最先进的深度强化学习(DRL)算法的模型无关解决方案。实验结果表明，相较于基准调度方法，效果感知调度显著提升了传输更新的有效性，尤其是在具有严格成本约束的场景下，优化的查询调度对于系统性能和整体有效性至关重要。 <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses query scheduling for goal-oriented semantic communication in pull-based status update systems. We consider a system where multiple sensing agents (SAs) observe a source characterized by various attributes and provide updates to multiple actuation agents (AAs), which act upon the received information to fulfill their heterogeneous goals at the endpoint. A hub serves as an intermediary, querying the SAs for updates on observed attributes and maintaining a knowledge base, which is then broadcast to the AAs. The AAs leverage the knowledge to perform their actions effectively. To quantify the semantic value of updates, we introduce a grade of effectiveness (GoE) metric. Furthermore, we integrate cumulative perspective theory (CPT) into the long-term effectiveness analysis to account for risk awareness and loss aversion in the system. Leveraging this framework, we compute effect-aware scheduling policies aimed at maximizing the expected discounted sum of CPT-based total GoE provided by the transmitted updates while complying with a given query cost constraint. To achieve this, we propose a model-based solution based on dynamic programming and model-free solutions employing state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. Our findings demonstrate that effect-aware scheduling significantly enhances the effectiveness of communicated updates compared to benchmark scheduling methods, particularly in settings with stringent cost constraints where optimal query scheduling is vital for system performance and overall effectiveness.

Abstract: The rise of agentic AI systems, where agents collaborate to perform diverse tasks, poses new challenges with observing, analyzing and optimizing their behavior. Traditional evaluation and benchmarking approaches struggle to handle the non-deterministic, context-sensitive, and dynamic nature of these systems. This paper explores key challenges and opportunities in analyzing and optimizing agentic systems across development, testing, and maintenance. We explore critical issues such as natural language variability and unpredictable execution flows, which hinder predictability and control, demanding adaptive strategies to manage input variability and evolving behaviors. Through our user study, we supported these hypotheses. In particular, we showed a 79% agreement that non deterministic flow of agentic systems acts as a major challenge. Finally, we validated our statements empirically advocating the need for moving beyond classical benchmarking. To bridge these gaps, we introduce taxonomies to present expected analytics outcomes and the ways to collect them by extending standard observability frameworks. Building on these foundations, we introduce and demonstrate novel approach for benchmarking of agent evaluation systems. Unlike traditional "black box" performance evaluation approaches, our benchmark is built from agent runtime logs as input, and analytics outcome including discovered flows and issues. By addressing key limitations in existing methodologies, we aim to set the stage for more advanced and holistic evaluation strategies, which could foster the development of adaptive, interpretable, and robust agentic AI systems.

Abstract: The convergence of robotics, advanced communication networks, and artificial intelligence (AI) holds the promise of transforming industries through fully automated and intelligent operations. In this work, we introduce a novel co-working framework for robots that unifies goal-oriented semantic communication (SemCom) with a Generative AI (GenAI)-agent under a semantic-aware network. SemCom prioritizes the exchange of meaningful information among robots and the network, thereby reducing overhead and latency. Meanwhile, the GenAI-agent leverages generative AI models to interpret high-level task instructions, allocate resources, and adapt to dynamic changes in both network and robotic environments. This agent-driven paradigm ushers in a new level of autonomy and intelligence, enabling complex tasks of networked robots to be conducted with minimal human intervention. We validate our approach through a multi-robot anomaly detection use-case simulation, where robots detect, compress, and transmit relevant information for classification. Simulation results confirm that SemCom significantly reduces data traffic while preserving critical semantic details, and the GenAI-agent ensures task coordination and network adaptation. This synergy provides a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for modern industrial environments.

Abstract: We address safe multi-robot interaction under uncertainty. In particular, we formulate a chance-constrained linear quadratic Gaussian game with coupling constraints and system uncertainties. We find a tractable reformulation of the game and propose a dual ascent algorithm. We prove that the algorithm converges to a generalized Nash equilibrium of the reformulated game, ensuring the satisfaction of the chance constraints. We test our method in driving simulations and real-world robot experiments. Our method ensures safety under uncertainty and generates less conservative trajectories than single-agent model predictive control.

<br /><br />总结:
本文介绍了AutoMisty，这是一个首个利用大型语言模型（LLMs）实现的多智能体协作框架，旨在使无编程经验的用户能够通过自然语言指令自定义Misty机器人的开放域交互。AutoMisty包含了四个专门的代理模块，分别负责任务分解、分配、问题解决和结果合成，并且每个代理都采用了两层优化机制，包括自我反思和人类在环路中的参与以更好地与用户偏好对齐。该框架确保了透明的推理过程，允许用户通过自然语言反馈迭代细化任务以实现精确执行。为了评估AutoMisty的有效性，研究者设计了一个涵盖四种复杂度级别的基准任务集并在真实的Misty机器人环境中进行了实验。结果显示，AutoMisty不仅能持续生成高质量代码，还能实现精确的代码控制，其性能显著优于直接使用ChatGPT-4o和ChatGPT-o1进行推理。相关的所有代码、优化后的API以及实验视频将在项目网页https://wangxiaoshawn.github.io/AutoMisty.html上公开发布。 <div>

Abstract: The social robot's open API allows users to customize open-domain interactions. However, it remains inaccessible to those without programming experience. In this work, we introduce AutoMisty, the first multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs), to enable the seamless generation of executable Misty robot code from natural language instructions. AutoMisty incorporates four specialized agent modules to manage task decomposition, assignment, problem-solving, and result synthesis. Each agent incorporates a two-layer optimization mechanism, with self-reflection for iterative refinement and human-in-the-loop for better alignment with user preferences. AutoMisty ensures a transparent reasoning process, allowing users to iteratively refine tasks through natural language feedback for precise execution. To evaluate AutoMisty's effectiveness, we designed a benchmark task set spanning four levels of complexity and conducted experiments in a real Misty robot environment. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoMisty not only consistently generates high-quality code but also enables precise code control, significantly outperforming direct reasoning with ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o1. All code, optimized APIs, and experimental videos will be publicly released through the webpage: https://wangxiaoshawn.github.io/AutoMisty.html

Abstract: Interaction between humans and AI systems raises the question of how people understand AI systems. This has been addressed with explainable AI, the interpretability arising from users' domain expertise, or collaborating with AI in a stable environment. In the absence of these elements, we discuss designing Actionable AI, which allows non-experts to configure black-box agents. In this paper, we experiment with an AI-powered cartpole game and observe 22 pairs of participants to configure it via direct manipulation. Our findings suggest that, in uncertain conditions, non-experts were able to achieve good levels of performance. By influencing the behaviour of the agent, they exhibited an operational understanding of it, which proved sufficient to reach their goals. Based on this, we derive implications for designing Actionable AI systems. In conclusion, we propose Actionable AI as a way to open access to AI-based agents, giving end users the agency to influence such agents towards their own goals.

Abstract: This paper presents the Soda language for verifying multi-agent systems. Soda is a high-level functional and object-oriented language that supports the compilation of its code not only to Scala, a strongly statically typed high-level programming language, but also to Lean, a proof assistant and programming language. Given these capabilities, Soda can implement multi-agent systems, or parts thereof, that can then be integrated into a mainstream software ecosystem on the one hand and formally verified with state-of-the-art tools on the other hand. We provide a brief and informal introduction to Soda and the aforementioned interoperability capabilities, as well as a simple demonstration of how interaction protocols can be designed and verified with Soda. In the course of the demonstration, we highlight challenges with respect to real-world applicability.

Abstract: How can we build generalist robot systems? Scale may not be enough due to the significant multimodality of robotics tasks, lack of easily accessible data and the challenges of deploying on physical hardware. Meanwhile, most deployed robotic systems today are inherently modular and can leverage the independent generalization capabilities of each module to perform well. Therefore, this thesis seeks to tackle the task of building generalist robot agents by integrating these components into one: combining modularity with large-scale learning for general purpose robot control. The first question we consider is: how can we build modularity and hierarchy into learning systems? Our key insight is that rather than having the agent learn hierarchy and low-level control end-to-end, we can enforce modularity via planning to enable more efficient and capable robot learners. Next, we come to the role of scale in building generalist robot systems. To scale, neural networks require vast amounts of diverse data, expressive architectures to fit the data and a source of supervision to generate the data. We leverage a powerful supervision source: classical planning, which can generalize, but is expensive to run and requires access to privileged information to perform well in practice. We use these planners to supervise large-scale policy learning in simulation to produce generalist agents. Finally, we consider how to unify modularity with large-scale policy learning to build real-world robot systems capable of performing zero-shot manipulation. We do so by tightly integrating key ingredients of modular high and mid-level planning, learned local control, procedural scene generation and large-scale policy learning for sim2real transfer. We demonstrate that this recipe can produce a single, generalist agent that can solve challenging long-horizon manipulation tasks in the real world.

Abstract: Robotics researchers increasingly leverage large language models (LLM) in robotics systems, using them as interfaces to receive task commands, generate task plans, form team coalitions, and allocate tasks among multi-robot and human agents. However, despite their benefits, the growing adoption of LLM in robotics has raised several safety concerns, particularly regarding executing malicious or unsafe natural language prompts. In addition, ensuring that task plans, team formation, and task allocation outputs from LLMs are adequately examined, refined, or rejected is crucial for maintaining system integrity. In this paper, we introduce SafePlan, a multi-component framework that combines formal logic and chain-of-thought reasoners for enhancing the safety of LLM-based robotics systems. Using the components of SafePlan, including Prompt Sanity COT Reasoner and Invariant, Precondition, and Postcondition COT reasoners, we examined the safety of natural language task prompts, task plans, and task allocation outputs generated by LLM-based robotic systems as means of investigating and enhancing system safety profile. Our results show that SafePlan outperforms baseline models by leading to 90.5% reduction in harmful task prompt acceptance while still maintaining reasonable acceptance of safe tasks.

arXiv:2503.06911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore explicit Large Language Model (LLM)-powered support for the iterative design of computer programs. Program design, like other design activity, is characterized by navigating a space of alternative problem formulations and associated solutions in an iterative fashion. LLMs are potentially powerful tools in helping this exploration; however, by default, code-generation LLMs deliver code that represents a particular point solution. This obscures the larger space of possible alternatives, many of which might be preferable to the LLM's default interpretation and its generated code. We contribute an IDE that supports program design through generating and showing new ways to frame problems alongside alternative solutions, tracking design decisions, and identifying implicit decisions made by either the programmer or the LLM. In a user study, we find that with our IDE, users combine and parallelize design phases to explore a broader design space -- but also struggle to keep up with LLM-originated changes to code and other information overload. These findings suggest a core challenge for future IDEs that support program design through higher-level instructions given to LLM-based agents: carefully managing attention and deciding what information agents should surface to program designers and when.

Abstract: Distributed optimization aims to leverage the local computation and communication capabilities of each agent to achieve a desired global objective. This paper addresses the distributed pose graph optimization (PGO) problem under non-convex constraints, with the goal of approximating the rotation and translation of each pose given relevant noisy measurements. To achieve this goal, the splitting method based on the concepts of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and Bregman iteration are applied to solve the rotation subproblems. The proposed approach enables the iterative resolution of constrained problems, achieved through solving unconstrained problems and orthogonality-constrained quadratic problems that have analytical solutions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against two practical methods in pose graph optimization: the Distributed Gauss-Seidel (DGS) algorithm and the centralized pose graph optimizer with an optimality certificate (SE-Sync). The efficiency of the proposed method is verified through its application to several simulated and real-world pose graph datasets. Unlike the DGS method, our approach attempts to solve distributed PGO problems without relaxing the non-convex constraints.

arXiv:2503.06937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-Shot Object Navigation (ZSON) requires agents to navigate to objects specified via open-ended natural language without predefined categories or prior environmental knowledge. While recent methods leverage foundation models or multi-modal maps, they often rely on 2D representations and greedy strategies or require additional training or modules with high computation load, limiting performance in complex environments and real applications. We propose WTRP-Searcher, a novel framework that formulates ZSON as a Weighted Traveling Repairman Problem (WTRP), minimizing the weighted waiting time of viewpoints. Using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), we score viewpoints based on object-description similarity, projected onto a 2D map with depth information. An open-vocabulary detector identifies targets, dynamically updating goals, while a 3D embedding feature map enhances spatial awareness and environmental recall. WTRP-Searcher outperforms existing methods, offering efficient global planning and improved performance in complex ZSON tasks. Code and more demos will be avaliable on https://github.com/lrm20011/WTRP_Searcher.

Abstract: General-sum differential games can approximate values solved by Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations for efficient inference when information is incomplete. However, solving such games through conventional methods encounters the curse of dimensionality (CoD). Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a scalable approach to alleviate the CoD and approximate values, but there exist convergence issues for value approximations through vanilla PINNs when state constraints lead to values with large Lipschitz constants, particularly in safety-critical applications. In addition to addressing CoD, it is necessary to learn a generalizable value across a parametric space of games, rather than training multiple ones for each specific player-type configuration. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Hybrid Neural Operator (HNO), which is an operator that can map parameter functions for games to value functions. HNO leverages informative supervised data and samples PDE-driven data across entire spatial-temporal space for model refinement. We evaluate HNO on 9D and 13D scenarios with nonlinear dynamics and state constraints, comparing it against a Supervised Neural Operator (a variant of DeepONet). Under the same computational budget and training data, HNO outperforms SNO for safety performance. This work provides a step toward scalable and generalizable value function approximation, enabling real-time inference for complex human-robot or multi-agent interactions.

Abstract: Recently, LLM agents have made rapid progress in improving their programming capabilities. However, existing benchmarks lack the ability to automatically evaluate from users' perspective, and also lack the explainability of the results of LLM agents' code generation capabilities. Thus, we introduce ProjectEval, a new benchmark for LLM agents project-level code generation's automated evaluation by simulating user interaction. ProjectEval is constructed by LLM with human reviewing. It has three different level inputs of natural languages or code skeletons. ProjectEval can evaluate the generated projects by user interaction simulation for execution, and by code similarity through existing objective indicators. Through ProjectEval, we find that systematic engineering project code, overall understanding of the project and comprehensive analysis capability are the keys for LLM agents to achieve practical projects. Our findings and benchmark provide valuable insights for developing more effective programming agents that can be deployed in future real-world production.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning Nash equilibrial policies for two-player risk-sensitive collision-avoiding interactions. Solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations of such general-sum differential games in real time is an open challenge due to the discontinuity of equilibrium values on the state space. A common solution is to learn a neural network that approximates the equilibrium Hamiltonian for given system states and actions. The learning, however, is usually supervised and requires a large amount of sample equilibrium policies from different initial states in order to mitigate the risks of collisions. This paper claims two contributions towards more data-efficient learning of equilibrium policies: First, instead of computing Hamiltonian through a value network, we show that the equilibrium co-states have simple structures when collision avoidance dominates the agents' loss functions and system dynamics is linear, and therefore are more data-efficient to learn. Second, we introduce theory-driven active learning to guide data sampling, where the acquisition function measures the compliance of the predicted co-states to Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. On an uncontrolled intersection case, the proposed method leads to more generalizable approximation of the equilibrium policies, and in turn, lower collision probabilities, than the state-of-the-art under the same data acquisition budget.

Abstract: There has been a surge in the use of large language models (LLM) conversational agents to generate responses based on long-term history from multiple sessions. However, existing long-term open-domain dialogue datasets lack complex, real-world personalization and fail to capture implicit reasoning-where relevant information is embedded in subtle, syntactic, or semantically distant connections rather than explicit statements. In such cases, traditional retrieval methods fail to capture relevant context, and long-context modeling also becomes inefficient due to numerous complicated persona-related details. To address this gap, we introduce ImplexConv, a large-scale long-term dataset with 2,500 examples, each containing approximately 100 conversation sessions, designed to study implicit reasoning in personalized dialogues. Additionally, we propose TaciTree, a novel hierarchical tree framework that structures conversation history into multiple levels of summarization. Instead of brute-force searching all data, TaciTree enables an efficient, level-based retrieval process where models refine their search by progressively selecting relevant details. Our experiments demonstrate that TaciTree significantly improves the ability of LLMs to reason over long-term conversations with implicit contextual dependencies.

In this paper, we propose LLM-RCO, a framework leveraging large language models to integrate human-like driving commonsense into autonomous systems facing perception deficits. LLM-RCO features four key modules: hazard inference, short-term motion planner, action condition verifier, and safety constraint generator. These modules interact with the dynamic driving environment, enabling proactive and context-aware control actions to override the original control policy of autonomous agents. To improve safety in such challenging conditions, we construct DriveLM-Deficit, a dataset of 53,895 video clips featuring deficits of safety-critical objects, complete with annotations for LLM-based hazard inference and motion planning fine-tuning. Extensive experiments in adverse driving conditions with the CARLA simulator demonstrate that systems equipped with LLM-RCO significantly improve driving performance, highlighting its potential for enhancing autonomous driving resilience against adverse perception deficits. Our results also show that LLMs fine-tuned with DriveLM-Deficit can enable more proactive movements instead of conservative stops in the context of perception deficits.

Abstract: Data Science tasks are multifaceted, dynamic, and often domain-specific. Existing LLM-based approaches largely concentrate on isolated phases, neglecting the interdependent nature of many data science tasks and limiting their capacity for comprehensive end-to-end support. We propose DatawiseAgent, a notebook-centric LLM agent framework that unifies interactions among user, agent and the computational environment through markdown and executable code cells, supporting flexible and adaptive automated data science. Built on a Finite State Transducer(FST), DatawiseAgent orchestrates four stages, including DSF-like planning, incremental execution, self-debugging, and post-filtering. Specifically, the DFS-like planning stage systematically explores the solution space, while incremental execution harnesses real-time feedback and accommodates LLM's limited capabilities to progressively complete tasks. The self-debugging and post-filtering modules further enhance reliability by diagnosing and correcting errors and pruning extraneous information. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including data analysis, visualization, and data modeling, show that DatawiseAgent consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods across multiple model settings. These results highlight its potential to generalize across data science scenarios and lay the groundwork for more efficient, fully automated workflows.

Abstract: Traditional rule--based decision--making methods with interpretable advantage, such as finite state machine, suffer from the jitter or deadlock(JoD) problems in extremely dynamic scenarios. To realize agent swarm confrontation, decision conflicts causing many JoD problems are a key issue to be solved. Here, we propose a novel decision--making framework that integrates probabilistic finite state machine, deep convolutional networks, and reinforcement learning to implement interpretable intelligence into agents.

Abstract: The development of a generalist agent with adaptive multiple manipulation skills has been a long-standing goal in the robotics community. In this paper, we explore a crucial task, skill-incremental learning, in robotic manipulation, which is to endow the robots with the ability to learn new manipulation skills based on the previous learned knowledge without re-training. First, we build a skill-incremental environment based on the RLBench benchmark, and explore how traditional incremental methods perform in this setting. We find that they suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting due to the previous methods on classification overlooking the characteristics of temporality and action complexity in robotic manipulation tasks. Towards this end, we propose an incremental Manip}ulation framework, termed iManip, to mitigate the above issues. We firstly design a temporal replay strategy to maintain the integrity of old skills when learning new skill. Moreover, we propose the extendable PerceiverIO, consisting of an action prompt with extendable weight to adapt to new action primitives in new skill. Extensive experiments show that our framework performs well in Skill-Incremental Learning. Codes of the skill-incremental environment with our framework will be open-source.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in AI and decision-making technologies in safety-critical fields, challenges remain in verifying the correctness of decision output schemes and verification-result driven design. We propose correctness learning (CL) to enhance human-AI collaboration integrating deductive verification methods and insights from historical high-quality schemes. The typical pattern hidden in historical high-quality schemes, such as change of task priorities in shared resources, provides critical guidance for intelligent agents in learning and decision-making. By utilizing deductive verification methods, we proposed patten-driven correctness learning (PDCL), formally modeling and reasoning the adaptive behaviors-or 'correctness pattern'-of system agents based on historical high-quality schemes, capturing the logical relationships embedded within these schemes. Using this logical information as guidance, we establish a correctness judgment and feedback mechanism to steer the intelligent decision model toward the 'correctness pattern' reflected in historical high-quality schemes. Extensive experiments across multiple working conditions and core parameters validate the framework's components and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving decision-making and resource optimization.

Abstract: Negotiation requires dynamically balancing self-interest and cooperation to maximize one's own utility. Yet, existing agents struggle due to bounded rationality in human data, low adaptability to counterpart behavior, and limited strategic reasoning. To address this, we introduce principle-driven negotiation agents, powered by ASTRA, a novel framework for turn-level offer optimization grounded in two core principles: opponent modeling and Tit-for-Tat reciprocity. ASTRA operates in three stages: (1) interpreting counterpart behavior, (2) optimizing counteroffers via a linear programming (LP) solver, and (3) selecting offers based on negotiation tactics and the partner's acceptance probability. Through simulations and human evaluations, our agent effectively adapts to an opponent's shifting stance and achieves favorable outcomes through enhanced adaptability and strategic reasoning. Beyond improving negotiation performance, it also serves as a powerful coaching tool, offering interpretable strategic feedback and optimal offer recommendations.

Abstract: Long-form article generation (LFAG) presents challenges such as maintaining logical consistency, comprehensive topic coverage, and narrative coherence across extended articles. Existing datasets often lack both the hierarchical structure and fine-grained annotation needed to effectively decompose tasks, resulting in shallow, disorganized article generation. To address these limitations, we introduce DeFine, a Decomposed and Fine-grained annotated dataset for long-form article generation. DeFine is characterized by its hierarchical decomposition strategy and the integration of domain-specific knowledge with multi-level annotations, ensuring granular control and enhanced depth in article generation. To construct the dataset, a multi-agent collaborative pipeline is proposed, which systematically segments the generation process into four parts: Data Miner, Cite Retreiver, Q&amp;A Annotator and Data Cleaner. To validate the effectiveness of DeFine, we designed and tested three LFAG baselines: the web retrieval, the local retrieval, and the grounded reference. We fine-tuned the Qwen2-7b-Instruct model using the DeFine training dataset. The experimental results showed significant improvements in text quality, specifically in topic coverage, depth of information, and content fidelity. Our dataset publicly available to facilitate future research.

本文提出了名为ReelWave的多代理框架，用于电影制作中的生成式音频应用。该框架通过训练预测模型捕捉到与画面同步的“画面上”声音的语义和时间变化控制信号，包括响度、音高和音色，并将这三个参数作为条件输入至跨注意力模块。接着，通过多个具有特定角色的通信智能体之间的协作互动，框架推断并补充了“画面上”之外的声音。其中还有一个智能体充当导演进行监督。此外，针对由多个场景组成的视频（如从长时间电影中截取的片段）这种情况，该框架能捕获更丰富的基于视频剪辑的音频生成上下文。 <div>
arXiv:2503.07217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Film production is an important application for generative audio, where richer context is provided through multiple scenes. In ReelWave, we propose a multi-agent framework for audio generation inspired by the professional movie production process. We first capture semantic and temporal synchronized "on-screen" sound by training a prediction model that predicts three interpretable time-varying audio control signals comprising loudness, pitch, and timbre. These three parameters are subsequently specified as conditions by a cross-attention module. Then, our framework infers "off-screen" sound to complement the generation through cooperative interaction between communicative agents. Each agent takes up specific roles similar to the movie production team and is supervised by an agent called the director. Besides, we investigate when the conditional video consists of multiple scenes, a case frequently seen in videos extracted from movies of considerable length. Consequently, our framework can capture a richer context of audio generation conditioned on video clips extracted from movies.

Abstract: Collaborative robotics cells leverage heterogeneous agents to provide agile production solutions. Effective coordination is essential to prevent inefficiencies and risks for human operators working alongside robots. This paper proposes a human-aware task allocation and scheduling model based on Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming to optimize efficiency and safety starting from task planning stages. The approach exploits synergies that encode the coupling effects between pairs of tasks executed in parallel by the agents, arising from the safety constraints imposed on robot agents. These terms are learned from previous executions using a Bayesian estimation; the inference of the posterior probability distribution of the synergy coefficients is performed using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The synergy enhances task planning by adapting the nominal duration of the plan according to the effect of the operator's presence. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method produces improved human-aware task plans, reducing unuseful interference between agents, increasing human-robot distance, and achieving up to an 18\% reduction in process execution time.

Abstract: We propose a distributed control strategy to allow the control of a multi-agent system requiring k-hop interactions based on the design of distributed state and input observers. In particular, we design for each agent a finite time convergent state and input observer that exploits only the communication with the 1-hop neighbors to reconstruct the information regarding those agents at a 2-hop distance or more. We then demonstrate that if the k-hop based control strategy is set-Input to State Stable with respect to the set describing the goal, then the observer information can be adopted to achieve the team objective with stability guarantees.

Abstract: Zero-shot human-AI coordination is the training of an ego-agent to coordinate with humans without using human data. Most studies on zero-shot human-AI coordination have focused on enhancing the ego-agent's coordination ability in a given environment without considering the issue of generalization to unseen environments. Real-world applications of zero-shot human-AI coordination should consider unpredictable environmental changes and the varying coordination ability of co-players depending on the environment. Previously, the multi-agent UED (Unsupervised Environment Design) approach has investigated these challenges by jointly considering environmental changes and co-player policy in competitive two-player AI-AI scenarios. In this paper, our study extends the multi-agent UED approach to a zero-shot human-AI coordination. We propose a utility function and co-player sampling for a zero-shot human-AI coordination setting that helps train the ego-agent to coordinate with humans more effectively than the previous multi-agent UED approach. The zero-shot human-AI coordination performance was evaluated in the Overcooked-AI environment, using human proxy agents and real humans. Our method outperforms other baseline models and achieves a high human-AI coordination performance in unseen environments.

Abstract: Trust plays a fundamental role in shaping the willingness of users to engage and collaborate with artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Yet, measuring user trust remains challenging due to its complex and dynamic nature. While traditional survey methods provide trust levels for long conversations, they fail to capture its dynamic evolution during ongoing interactions. Here, we present VizTrust, which addresses this challenge by introducing a real-time visual analytics tool that leverages a multi-agent collaboration system to capture and analyze user trust dynamics in human-agent communication. Built on established human-computer trust scales-competence, integrity, benevolence, and predictability-, VizTrust enables stakeholders to observe trust formation as it happens, identify patterns in trust development, and pinpoint specific interaction elements that influence trust. Our tool offers actionable insights into human-agent trust formation and evolution in real time through a dashboard, supporting the design of adaptive conversational agents that responds effectively to user trust signals.

Abstract: Existing long-form video generation frameworks lack automated planning, requiring manual input for storylines, scenes, cinematography, and character interactions, resulting in high costs and inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we present MovieAgent, an automated movie generation via multi-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) planning. MovieAgent offers two key advantages: 1) We firstly explore and define the paradigm of automated movie/long-video generation. Given a script and character bank, our MovieAgent can generates multi-scene, multi-shot long-form videos with a coherent narrative, while ensuring character consistency, synchronized subtitles, and stable audio throughout the film. 2) MovieAgent introduces a hierarchical CoT-based reasoning process to automatically structure scenes, camera settings, and cinematography, significantly reducing human effort. By employing multiple LLM agents to simulate the roles of a director, screenwriter, storyboard artist, and location manager, MovieAgent streamlines the production pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that MovieAgent achieves new state-of-the-art results in script faithfulness, character consistency, and narrative coherence. Our hierarchical framework takes a step forward and provides new insights into fully automated movie generation.

Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), AI agents as autonomous decision-makers present significant opportunities and challenges for human-AI cooperation. While many studies have explored human cooperation with AI as tools, the role of LLM-augmented autonomous agents in competitive-cooperative interactions remains under-examined. This study investigates human cooperative behavior by engaging 30 participants who interacted with LLM agents exhibiting different characteristics (purported human, purported rule-based AI agent, and LLM agent) in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Findings show significant differences in cooperative behavior based on the agents' purported characteristics and the interaction effect of participants' genders and purported characteristics. We also analyzed human response patterns, including game completion time, proactive favorable behavior, and acceptance of repair efforts. These insights offer a new perspective on human interactions with LLM agents in competitive cooperation contexts, such as virtual avatars or future physical entities. The study underscores the importance of understanding human biases toward AI agents and how observed behaviors can influence future human-AI cooperation dynamics.

Leveraging LLMs for navigation holds significant potential, given LLMs' ability to handle unseen scenarios, support user-agent interactions, and provide global control across complex systems, making them well-suited for agentic planning and humanoid motion generation. As one of the first studies in this domain, we explore the zero-shot navigation and path generation capabilities of LLMs by constructing a dataset and proposing an evaluation protocol. Specifically, we represent paths using anchor points connected by straight lines, enabling movement in various directions. This approach offers greater flexibility and practicality compared to previous methods while remaining simple and intuitive for LLMs. We demonstrate that, when tasks are well-structured in this manner, modern LLMs exhibit substantial planning proficiency in avoiding obstacles while autonomously refining navigation with the generated motion to reach the target. Further, this spatial reasoning ability of a single LLM motion agent interacting in a static environment can be seamlessly generalized in multi-motion agents coordination in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on single-step planning or local policies, our training-free LLM-based method enables global, dynamic, closed-loop planning, and autonomously resolving collision issues.

<div> 关键词：T$^3$Former、世界模型、自动驾驶、4D占用模型、时空运动特征

<br /><br />总结:
本文提出了一种新的用于自动驾驶的4D占用世界模型——T$^3$Former，旨在解决现有方法在捕捉细粒度环境变化与移动轨迹之间关系以及实时预测上的难题。T$^3$Former首先通过预训练得到一种紧凑的三平面表示，该表示能有效地压缩三维语义上被占用的环境。接着，从历史三平面中提取多尺度时间运动特征，并采用自回归方法迭代预测下一时刻的三平面变化。最后，T$^3$Former将预测的三平面变化与先前的变化结合，解码成未来的占用结果和自主车辆的运动轨迹。实验结果显示，T$^3$Former在保持高精度（提升平均IoU至36.09，减少平均绝对规划误差至1.0米）的同时，还实现了更快的推理速度（提高到26 FPS），性能优越。 <div>

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advances in world models, which primarily focus on learning fine-grained correlations between an agent's motion trajectory and the resulting changes in its surrounding environment. However, existing methods often struggle to capture such fine-grained correlations and achieve real-time predictions. To address this, we propose a new 4D occupancy world model for autonomous driving, termed T$^3$Former. T$^3$Former begins by pre-training a compact triplane representation that efficiently compresses the 3D semantically occupied environment. Next, T$^3$Former extracts multi-scale temporal motion features from the historical triplane and employs an autoregressive approach to iteratively predict the next triplane changes. Finally, T$^3$Former combines the triplane changes with the previous ones to decode them into future occupancy results and ego-motion trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of T$^3$Former, achieving 1.44$\times$ faster inference speed (26 FPS), while improving the mean IoU to 36.09 and reducing the mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters.

Abstract: Prevailing top-down systems in politics and economics struggle to keep pace with the pressing challenges of the 21st century, such as climate change, social inequality and conflict. Bottom-up democratisation and participatory approaches in politics and economics are increasingly seen as promising alternatives to confront and overcome these issues, often with utopian overtones, as proponents believe they may dramatically reshape political, social and ecological futures for the better and in contrast to contemporary authoritarian tendencies across various countries. Institutional specifics and the associated collective human behavior or culture remains little understood and debated, however. In this article, I propose a novel research agenda focusing on utopian democratisation efforts with formal and computational methods as well as with artificial intelligence - I call this agenda Artificial Utopia. Artificial Utopias provide safe testing grounds for new political ideas and economic policies in-silico with reduced risk of negative consequences as compared to testing ideas in real-world contexts. An increasing number of advanced simulation and intelligence methods, that aim at representing human cognition and collective decision-making in more realistic ways, could benefit this process. This includes agent-based modelling, reinforcement learning, large language models and more. I clarify what some of these simulation approaches can contribute to the study of Artificial Utopias with the help of two institutional examples: the citizen assembly and the democratic firm.

总结:

我们提出了一种名为AttentionSwarm的新颖基准测试，用于评估在包含障碍物的着陆环境、竞争性的无人机游戏场景以及动态无人机竞速场景中安全而高效的群体控制。该方法的核心是以注意力模型为基础的控制 Barrier 函数（CBF）框架，它将注意力机制与安全性关键的控制理论相结合，实现了实时碰撞避障和轨迹优化。通过使用注意力权重动态优先处理临近的关键障碍物和群组成员，CBFs则能正式确保执行碰撞避免约束以保证安全。利用Crazyflie 2.1微型四旋翼无人机进行安全注意力网络算法的实际开发与室内评估，并借助Vicon运动捕捉系统实现精确定位和控制。实验结果显示，我们的系统在动态着陆环境中实现了平均耗时23秒、误差仅3.02厘米的精准着陆，以及无人机游戏环境中的100%无碰撞导航，而在动态多智能体无人机竞速环境中也达到了95%的无碰撞航行率。这一工作为那些重视安全性与快速响应的动态环境应用提供了具有潜力的基础。 <div>

Abstract: We introduce AttentionSwarm, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate safe and efficient swarm control across three challenging environments: a landing environment with obstacles, a competitive drone game setting, and a dynamic drone racing scenario. Central to our approach is the Attention Model Based Control Barrier Function (CBF) framework, which integrates attention mechanisms with safety-critical control theory to enable real-time collision avoidance and trajectory optimization. This framework dynamically prioritizes critical obstacles and agents in the swarms vicinity using attention weights, while CBFs formally guarantee safety by enforcing collision-free constraints. The safe attention net algorithm was developed and evaluated using a swarm of Crazyflie 2.1 micro quadrotors, which were tested indoors with the Vicon motion capture system to ensure precise localization and control. Experimental results show that our system achieves landing accuracy of 3.02 cm with a mean time of 23 s and collision-free landings in a dynamic landing environment, 100% and collision-free navigation in a drone game environment, and 95% and collision-free navigation for a dynamic multiagent drone racing environment, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. This work offers a promising foundation for applications in dynamic environments where safety and fastness are paramount.

总结:
本文提出了一种名为Q-MARL的全新无中心化深度强化学习架构，该架构受量子化学中基于图的方法启发，用于预测分子性质。Q-MARL适用于大规模多智能体强化学习场景，无需假设共同奖励或代理顺序。每个智能体视为其环境中的动态变化部分，并以自身为中心构建局部邻域关系。每个角色被形式化为子图，子图作为训练样本。通过消息传递神经网络实现局部邻域内的顶点和边充分交互，并利用一个参数控制子图的深度来减轻训练负担。测试阶段，智能体的行为决策在其所在的所有子图上进行局部集成，从而获得稳健性。相比于其他方法难以处理超过50个智能体的情况，Q-MARL能轻松调度数千个智能体。理论分析证明了Q-MARL的改进与收敛性，仿真结果显示其在典型的合作与竞争场景中具有更快的训练速度和更低的训练损失。 <div>
arXiv:2503.07397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by a graph-based technique for predicting molecular properties in quantum chemistry -- atoms' position within molecules in three-dimensional space -- we present Q-MARL, a completely decentralised learning architecture that supports very large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios without the need for strong assumptions like common rewards or agent order. The key is to treat each agent as relative to its surrounding agents in an environment that is presumed to change dynamically. Hence, in each time step, an agent is the centre of its own neighbourhood and also a neighbour to many other agents. Each role is formulated as a sub-graph, and each sub-graph is used as a training sample. A message-passing neural network supports full-scale vertex and edge interaction within a local neighbourhood, while a parameter governing the depth of the sub-graphs eases the training burden. During testing, an agent's actions are locally ensembled across all the sub-graphs that contain it, resulting in robust decisions. Where other approaches struggle to manage 50 agents, Q-MARL can easily marshal thousands. A detailed theoretical analysis proves improvement and convergence, and simulations with the typical collaborative and competitive scenarios show dramatically faster training speeds and reduced training losses.

Abstract: Robot foundation models hold the potential for deployment across diverse environments, from industrial applications to household tasks. While current research focuses primarily on the policies' generalization capabilities across a variety of tasks, it fails to address safety, a critical requirement for deployment on real-world systems. In this paper, we introduce a safety layer designed to constrain the action space of any generalist policy appropriately. Our approach uses ATACOM, a safe reinforcement learning algorithm that creates a safe action space and, therefore, ensures safe state transitions. By extending ATACOM to generalist policies, our method facilitates their deployment in safety-critical scenarios without requiring any specific safety fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this safety layer in an air hockey environment, where it prevents a puck-hitting agent from colliding with its surroundings, a failure observed in generalist policies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on existing medical question-answering benchmarks. This high performance makes it increasingly difficult to meaningfully evaluate and differentiate advanced methods. We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints. Our benchmark and evaluation framework are publicly available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/medagents-benchmark.

Abstract: Reasoning segmentation is a challenging vision-language task that aims to output the segmentation mask with respect to a complex, implicit, and even non-visual query text. Previous works incorporated multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with segmentation models to approach the difficult problem. However, their segmentation quality often falls short in complex cases, particularly when dealing with out-of-domain objects with intricate structures, blurry boundaries, occlusions, or high similarity with surroundings. In this paper, we introduce ThinkFirst, a training-free reasoning segmentation framework that leverages GPT's chain of thought to address these challenging cases. Our approach allows GPT-4o or other powerful MLLMs to generate a detailed, chain-of-thought description of an image. This summarized description is then passed to a language-instructed segmentation assistant to aid the segmentation process. Our framework allows users to easily interact with the segmentation agent using multimodal inputs, such as easy text and image scribbles, for successive refinement or communication. We evaluate the performance of ThinkFirst on diverse objects. Extensive experiments show that, this zero-shot-CoT approach significantly improves the vanilla reasoning segmentation agent, both qualitatively and quantitatively, while being less sensitive or critical to user-supplied prompts after Thinking First.

Abstract: In human-robot interactions, human and robot agents maintain internal mental models of their environment, their shared task, and each other. The accuracy of these representations depends on each agent's ability to perform theory of mind, i.e. to understand the knowledge, preferences, and intentions of their teammate. When mental models diverge to the extent that it affects task execution, reconciliation becomes necessary to prevent the degradation of interaction. We propose a framework for bi-directional mental model reconciliation, leveraging large language models to facilitate alignment through semi-structured natural language dialogue. Our framework relaxes the assumption of prior model reconciliation work that either the human or robot agent begins with a correct model for the other agent to align to. Through our framework, both humans and robots are able to identify and communicate missing task-relevant context during interaction, iteratively progressing toward a shared mental model.

Abstract: Design has the power to cultivate hope, especially in the face of seemingly intractable societal challenges. This one-day workshop explores how design methodologies -- ranging from problem reframing to participatory, speculative, and critical design -- can empower research communities to drive meaningful real-world changes. By aligning design thinking with hope theory -- framework of viewing hope as "goal-directed," "pathways," and "agentic" thinking processes -- we aim to examine how researchers can move beyond focusing on harm mitigation and instead reimagine alternative futures. Through hands-on activities, participants will engage in problem reframing, develop a taxonomy of design methods related to hope, and explore how community-driven design approaches can sustain efforts toward societal and individual hope. The workshop also interrogates the ethical and practical boundaries of leveraging hope in design research. By the end of the session, participants will leave with concrete strategies for integrating a hopeful design approach into their research, as well as a network for ongoing collaboration. Ultimately, we position hopeful design not just as a practical tool for action and problem-solving but as a catalyst for cultivating resilience and envisioning transformative futures.

Abstract: Coalition formation explores how to partition a set of $n$ agents into disjoint coalitions according to their preferences. We consider a cardinal utility model with an additively separable aggregation of preferences and study the online variant of coalition formation, where the agents arrive in sequence. The goal is to achieve competitive social welfare. In the basic model, agents arrive in an arbitrary order and have to be assigned to coalitions immediately and irrevocably. There, the natural greedy algorithm is known to achieve an optimal competitive ratio, which heavily relies on the range of utilities.
  We complement this result by considering two related models. First, we study a model where agents arrive in a random order. We find that the competitive ratio of the greedy algorithm is $\Theta\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right)$. In contrast, an alternative algorithm, which is based on alternating between waiting and greedy phases, can achieve a competitive ratio of $\Theta\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)$. Second, we relax the irrevocability of decisions by allowing the dissolution of coalitions into singleton coalitions. We achieve an asymptotically optimal competitive ratio of $\Theta\left(\frac 1n\right)$ by drawing a close connection to a general model of online matching. Hence, in both models, we obtain a competitive ratio that removes the unavoidable utility dependencies in the basic model and essentially matches the best possible approximation ratio by polynomial-time algorithms.

本文研究了一个强化学习场景下的随机多臂赌博机问题变种，该问题应用于在线劳动市场等环境。在这个设定中，每条“手臂”代表具有不同性能特性的战略主体，平台（即决策者）需在每一轮选择一个主体来完成任务。与传统设置不同的是，当选择一个主体时，它可以修改其奖励值，通过吸收或提高奖励，但会增加成本。决策者需要解决一个机制设计问题以激励各主体发挥最佳表现。然而，由于即使有了有效的机制，主体仍可能存在非理性行为偏离均衡，因此决策者需要一个既能够实现激励性能又对非均衡行为有非真空保证的鲁棒算法。文中提出了一类同时满足这两个目标的带臂算法，并指出了这类算法应具备的一些直观性质。最后，通过将第二价格拍卖思想与所提算法相结合，作者展示了在决策者对主体性能特征毫无了解的情况下，此类问题也可以得到处理。 <div>

Abstract: Motivated by applications such as online labor markets we consider a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem where we have a collection of arms representing strategic agents with different performance characteristics. The platform (principal) chooses an agent in each round to complete a task. Unlike the standard setting, when an arm is pulled it can modify its reward by absorbing it or improving it at the expense of a higher cost. The principle has to solve a mechanism design problem to incentivize the arms to give their best performance. However, since even with an effective mechanism agents may still deviate from rational behavior, the principal wants a robust algorithm that also gives a non-vacuous guarantee on the total accumulated rewards under non-equilibrium behavior. In this paper, we introduce a class of bandit algorithms that meet the two objectives of performance incentivization and robustness simultaneously. We do this by identifying a collection of intuitive properties that a bandit algorithm has to satisfy to achieve these objectives. Finally, we show that settings where the principal has no information about the arms' performance characteristics can be handled by combining ideas from second price auctions with our algorithms.

Abstract: Coalition formation is concerned with the question of how to partition a set of agents into disjoint coalitions according to their preferences. Deviating from most of the previous work, we consider an online variant of the problem, where agents arrive in sequence. Whenever an agent arrives, they must be assigned to a coalition immediately and irrevocably. The scarce existing literature on online coalition formation has focused on maximizing social welfare, a demanding requirement, even in the offline setting. Instead, we seek to achieve \emph{stable} coalition structures online and treat the most common stability concepts based on deviations by single agents and groups of agents. We present a comprehensive picture in additively separable hedonic games, leading to dichotomies, where positive results are obtained by deterministic algorithms and negative results even hold for randomized algorithms.

Abstract: In the digital era, the prevalence of depressive symptoms expressed on social media has raised serious concerns, necessitating advanced methodologies for timely detection. This paper addresses the challenge of interpretable depression detection by proposing a novel methodology that effectively combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and conversational agents like ChatGPT. In our methodology, explanations are achieved by integrating BERTweet, a Twitter-specific variant of BERT, into a novel self-explanatory model, namely BERT-XDD, capable of providing both classification and explanations via masked attention. The interpretability is further enhanced using ChatGPT to transform technical explanations into human-readable commentaries. By introducing an effective and modular approach for interpretable depression detection, our methodology can contribute to the development of socially responsible digital platforms, fostering early intervention and support for mental health challenges under the guidance of qualified healthcare professionals.

总结:
本文提出了一种针对具有两层结构环境（已知高层图和每个顶点包含马尔科夫决策过程的“房间”）的新颖控制器设计框架。该框架通过不同的设计技术分别处理高低层次任务，利用反应式合成方法为高层任务制定逻辑公式规范，并根据低层策略集合与简洁的潜在结构构建规划器，选择在每个房间应用哪个低层策略。文章介绍了一种强化学习算法，用于在潜在结构上训练低层策略，避免了模型蒸馏步骤，并确保了政策及其抽象质量的近似正确性保证。这些正式保障是该框架的主要优势，同时其还具备可扩展性（房间大且动态未知）以及低层策略的可重用性。文中通过具有移动障碍物和视觉输入的挑战性案例研究证明了该框架的可行性。<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: We propose a novel framework to controller design in environments with a two-level structure: a known high-level graph ("map") in which each vertex is populated by a Markov decision process, called a "room". The framework "separates concerns" by using different design techniques for low- and high-level tasks. We apply reactive synthesis for high-level tasks: given a specification as a logical formula over the high-level graph and a collection of low-level policies obtained together with "concise" latent structures, we construct a "planner" that selects which low-level policy to apply in each room. We develop a reinforcement learning procedure to train low-level policies on latent structures, which unlike previous approaches, circumvents a model distillation step. We pair the policy with probably approximately correct guarantees on its performance and on the abstraction quality, and lift these guarantees to the high-level task. These formal guarantees are the main advantage of the framework. Other advantages include scalability (rooms are large and their dynamics are unknown) and reusability of low-level policies. We demonstrate feasibility in challenging case studies where an agent navigates environments with moving obstacles and visual inputs.

Abstract: Data standardization is a crucial part of the data science life cycle. While tools like Pandas offer robust functionalities, their complexity and the manual effort required for customizing code to diverse column types pose significant challenges. Although large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown promise in automating this process through natural language understanding and code generation, it still demands expert-level programming knowledge and continuous interaction for prompt refinement. To solve these challenges, our key idea is to propose a Python library with declarative, unified APIs for standardizing different column types, simplifying the LLM's code generation with concise API calls. We first propose Dataprep.Clean, a component of the Dataprep Python Library, significantly reduces the coding complexity by enabling the standardization of specific column types with a single line of code. Then, we introduce the CleanAgent framework integrating Dataprep.Clean and LLM-based agents to automate the data standardization process. With CleanAgent, data scientists only need to provide their requirements once, allowing for a hands-free process. To demonstrate the practical utility of CleanAgent, we developed a user-friendly web application, allowing attendees to interact with it using real-world datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for autonomous driving trajectory generation by harnessing the complementary strengths of diffusion probabilistic models (a.k.a., diffusion models) and transformers. Our proposed framework, termed the "World-Centric Diffusion Transformer"(WcDT), optimizes the entire trajectory generation process, from feature extraction to model inference. To enhance the scene diversity and stochasticity, the historical trajectory data is first preprocessed into "Agent Move Statement" and encoded into latent space using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) enhanced with Diffusion with Transformer (DiT) blocks. Then, the latent features, historical trajectories, HD map features, and historical traffic signal information are fused with various transformer-based encoders that are used to enhance the interaction of agents with other elements in the traffic scene. The encoded traffic scenes are then decoded by a trajectory decoder to generate multimodal future trajectories. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed approach exhibits superior performance in generating both realistic and diverse trajectories, showing its potential for integration into automatic driving simulation systems. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/yangchen1997/WcDT}.

<div> 关键词: 多智能体路径规划(MAPF), 解耦方法, 计算资源, 内存空间, 算法框架<br /><br />总结:

本文提出了一种针对多智能体路径规划(MAPF)问题的解耦方法，旨在解决随着智能体数量增加导致的计算和内存需求呈指数级增长的问题。该方法将大规模的MAPF实例分解为多个涉及较少智能体的孤立子问题，然后提供了一个通用框架，使得现有的多种MAPF算法可以独立地求解这些子问题，并将解决方案合并为一个无冲突的整体解决方案，尽可能避免可解性损失。与专注于减少MAPF时间成本的现有工作不同，该方法适用于所有MAPF算法。实验结果显示，使用经典MAPF基准测试了七种主流MAPF方法，平均能在1秒内完成MAPF实例的分解，并显著降低了内存占用或计算时间开销，特别是对于串行方法。通过大量实验推测，由该方法引起的可解性损失可能性小于1%。为了促进社区内的进一步研究，作者已经将提出的算法源代码公开可用。 <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) holds significant utility within autonomous systems, however, the calculation and memory space required for multi-agent path finding (MAPF) grows exponentially as the number of agents increases. This often results in some MAPF instances being unsolvable under limited computational resources and memory space, thereby limiting the application of MAPF in complex scenarios. Hence, we propose a decomposition approach for MAPF instances, which breaks down instances involving a large number of agents into multiple isolated subproblems involving fewer agents. Moreover, we present a framework to enable general MAPF algorithms to solve each subproblem independently and merge their solutions into one conflict-free final solution, and avoid loss of solvability as much as possible. Unlike existing works that propose isolated methods aimed at reducing the time cost of MAPF, our method is applicable to all MAPF methods. In our results, we apply decomposition to multiple state-of-the-art MAPF methods using a classic MAPF benchmark\footnote{https://movingai.com/benchmarks/mapf.html}. The decomposition of MAPF instances is completed on average within 1s, and its application to seven MAPF methods reduces the memory usage or time cost significantly, particularly for serial methods. Based on massive experiments, we speculate the possibilty about loss of solvability caused by our method is $<$ 1\%. To facilitate further research within the community, we have made the source code of the proposed algorithm publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/JoeYao-bit/LayeredMAPF/tree/minimize\_dependence}.

总结:
本文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架，旨在适应性地引导多个代理人的黑盒决策系统中的纳什均衡达到社会最优状态。文章首先提出了一个多智能体揭示偏好的帕累托最优测试，该测试为存在满足观测到的混合策略纳什均衡是社会最优的效用函数提供了必要和充分条件。接着，利用这一结果构建了一个逆强化学习步骤，用于确定观测策略与帕累托最优的距离（即帕累托差距）。将此 IRL 步骤与 RL 政策梯度算法结合并证明了收敛性，可以诱导出在均衡策略中实现社会最优。此外，作者还揭示了所构建损失函数与几种稳健揭示偏好度量之间的紧密联系，通过这些已建立的微观经济原则来分析算法次优性。最后，在只有有限个独立同分布的来自混合策略的样本（部分策略规范）可用的情况下，文中得出了算法收敛性的集中界限，并构建了一个分布鲁棒的 RL 程序，实现了对完全规范策略的社会最优机制设计。 <div>

Abstract: Suppose a black box, representing multiple agents, generates decisions from a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium of a game. Assume that we can choose the input vector to the black box and this affects the utilities of the agents, but we do not know the utilities of the individual agents. By viewing the decisions from the black box, how can we steer the Nash equilibrium to a socially optimal point? This paper constructs a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for adaptively achieving this mechanism design objective. We first derive a novel multi-agent revealed preference test for Pareto optimality -- this yields necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of utility functions under which empirically observed mixed-strategy Nash equilibria are socially optimal. These conditions take the form of a testable linear program, and this result is of independent interest. We utilize this result to construct an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) step to determine the Pareto gap, i.e., the distance of observed strategies from Pareto optimality. We pair this IRL step with an RL policy gradient algorithm and prove convergence to a mechanism which minimizes the Pareto gap, thereby inducing social optimality in equilibria strategies. We also reveal an intimate connection between our constructed loss function and several robust revealed preference metrics; this allows us to reason about algorithmic suboptimality through the lens of these well-established microeconomic principles. Finally, in the case when only finitely many i.i.d. samples from mixed-strategies (partial strategy specifications) are available, we derive concentration bounds for our algorithm's convergence, and we construct a distributionally robust RL procedure which achieves mechanism design for the fully specified strategies.

Abstract: Agents based on large language models have shown great potential in accelerating scientific discovery by leveraging their rich background knowledge and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce BioDiscoveryAgent, an agent that designs new experiments, reasons about their outcomes, and efficiently navigates the hypothesis space to reach desired solutions. We demonstrate our agent on the problem of designing genetic perturbation experiments, where the aim is to find a small subset out of many possible genes that, when perturbed, result in a specific phenotype (e.g., cell growth). Utilizing its biological knowledge, BioDiscoveryAgent can uniquely design new experiments without the need to train a machine learning model or explicitly design an acquisition function as in Bayesian optimization. Moreover, BioDiscoveryAgent, using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieves an average of 21% improvement in predicting relevant genetic perturbations across six datasets, and a 46% improvement in the harder task of non-essential gene perturbation, compared to existing Bayesian optimization baselines specifically trained for this task. Our evaluation includes one dataset that is unpublished, ensuring it is not part of the language model's training data. Additionally, BioDiscoveryAgent predicts gene combinations to perturb more than twice as accurately as a random baseline, a task so far not explored in the context of closed-loop experiment design. The agent also has access to tools for searching the biomedical literature, executing code to analyze biological datasets, and prompting another agent to critically evaluate its predictions. Overall, BioDiscoveryAgent is interpretable at every stage, representing an accessible new paradigm in the computational design of biological experiments with the potential to augment scientists' efficacy.

Abstract: In this work, we study the multitasking principal-agent problem. The agent performs several task for the principal, and the principal posts a contract incentivizing the agent to exert effort. The principal can observe a signal for each task, and the contract is a mapping from the space of possible signals to a payment. We study the special class of linear contracts from three perspectives: robustness, uniformity, and learning. Firstly, we show a robustness result: in an ambiguous setting when only first moment information is known, there is a linear contract maximizing the principal's payoff in a worst-case scenario. Secondly, we show a uniformity result: when the agent's cost function is homogeneous to a certain degree and the the principal's utility takes a linear form across tasks, then the optimal contract depends on the agent's cost function only through its homogeneuity degree. Thirdly, we study the problem of learning an optimal linear contract through observational data. We identify this as an measurement error model, and propose instrumental regression methods to estimate the optimal contract parameters in an offline setting, or to learn the optimal contract in an online setting.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) agents has raised new concerns regarding their safety and security, which cannot be addressed by traditional textual-harm-focused LLM guardrails. We propose GuardAgent, the first guardrail agent to protect the target agents by dynamically checking whether their actions satisfy given safety guard requests. Specifically, GuardAgent first analyzes the safety guard requests to generate a task plan, and then maps this plan into guardrail code for execution. By performing the code execution, GuardAgent can deterministically follow the safety guard request and safeguard target agents. In both steps, an LLM is utilized as the reasoning component, supplemented by in-context demonstrations retrieved from a memory module storing experiences from previous tasks. GuardAgent can understand different safety guard requests and provide reliable code-based guardrails with high flexibility and low operational overhead. In addition, we propose two novel benchmarks: EICU-AC benchmark to assess the access control for healthcare agents and Mind2Web-SC benchmark to evaluate the safety policies for web agents. We show that GuardAgent effectively moderates the violation actions for different types of agents on these two benchmarks with over 98% and 83% guardrail accuracies, respectively.

Abstract: The rise of powerful large language models (LLMs) has spurred a new trend in building LLM-based autonomous agents for solving complex tasks, especially multi-agent systems. Despite the remarkable progress, we notice that existing works are heavily dependent on human-designed frameworks, which greatly limits the functional scope and scalability of agent systems. How to automatically extend the specialized agent to multi-agent systems to improve task-solving capability still remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce EvoAgent, a generic method to automatically extend specialized agents to multi-agent systems via the evolutionary algorithm, thereby improving the effectiveness of LLM-based agents in solving tasks. Specifically, we consider the existing agent frameworks as the initial individual and then apply a series of evolutionary operators (e.g., mutation, crossover, selection, etc.) to generate multiple agents with diverse settings. Experimental results across various tasks show that EvoAgent can significantly enhance the task-solving capability of LLM-based agents, and can be generalized to any LLM-based agent framework to extend them into multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Grounding natural language in 3D environments is a critical step toward achieving robust 3D vision-language alignment. Current datasets and models for 3D visual grounding predominantly focus on identifying and localizing objects from static, object-centric descriptions. These approaches do not adequately address the dynamic and sequential nature of task-oriented scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel task: Task-oriented Sequential Grounding and Navigation in 3D Scenes, where models must interpret step-by-step instructions for daily activities by either localizing a sequence of target objects in indoor scenes or navigating toward them within a 3D simulator. To facilitate this task, we present SG3D, a large-scale dataset comprising 22,346 tasks with 112,236 steps across 4,895 real-world 3D scenes. The dataset is constructed by combining RGB-D scans from various 3D scene datasets with an automated task generation pipeline, followed by human verification for quality assurance. We benchmark contemporary methods on SG3D, revealing the significant challenges in understanding task-oriented context across multiple steps. Furthermore, we propose SG-LLM, a state-of-the-art approach leveraging a stepwise grounding paradigm to tackle the sequential grounding task. Our findings underscore the need for further research to advance the development of more capable and context-aware embodied agents.

Abstract: A team of multiple robots seamlessly and safely working in human-filled public environments requires adaptive task allocation and socially-aware navigation that account for dynamic human behavior. Current approaches struggle with highly dynamic pedestrian movement and the need for flexible task allocation. We propose Hyper-SAMARL, a hypergraph-based system for multi-robot task allocation and socially-aware navigation, leveraging multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Hyper-SAMARL models the environmental dynamics between robots, humans, and points of interest (POIs) using a hypergraph, enabling adaptive task assignment and socially-compliant navigation through a hypergraph diffusion mechanism. Our framework, trained with MARL, effectively captures interactions between robots and humans, adapting tasks based on real-time changes in human activity. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyper-SAMARL outperforms baseline models in terms of social navigation, task completion efficiency, and adaptability in various simulated scenarios.

Abstract: Trust is essential in human-robot collaboration, particularly in multi-human, multi-robot (MH-MR) teams, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining team cohesion in complex operational environments. Despite its importance, trust is rarely incorporated into task allocation and reallocation algorithms for MH-MR collaboration. While prior research in single-human, single-robot interactions has shown that integrating trust significantly enhances both performance outcomes and user experience, its role in MH-MR task allocation remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Expectation Confirmation Trust (ECT) Model, a novel framework for modeling trust dynamics in MH-MR teams. We evaluate the ECT model against five existing trust models and a no-trust baseline to assess its impact on task allocation outcomes across different team configurations (2H-2R, 5H-5R, and 10H-10R). Our results show that the ECT model improves task success rate, reduces mean completion time, and lowers task error rates. These findings highlight the complexities of trust-based task allocation in MH-MR teams. We discuss the implications of incorporating trust into task allocation algorithms and propose future research directions for adaptive trust mechanisms that balance efficiency and performance in dynamic, multi-agent environments.

Abstract: Value alignment, which aims to ensure that large language models (LLMs) and other AI agents behave in accordance with human values, is critical for ensuring safety and trustworthiness of these systems. A key component of value alignment is the modeling of human preferences as a representation of human values. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of value alignment by examining the sensitivity of preference models. Specifically, we ask: how do changes in the probabilities of some preferences affect the predictions of these models for other preferences? To answer this question, we theoretically analyze the robustness of widely used preference models by examining their sensitivities to minor changes in preferences they model. Our findings reveal that, in the Bradley-Terry and the Placket-Luce model, the probability of a preference can change significantly as other preferences change, especially when these preferences are dominant (i.e., with probabilities near 0 or 1). We identify specific conditions where this sensitivity becomes significant for these models and discuss the practical implications for the robustness and safety of value alignment in AI systems.

Abstract: Although LLM-based agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), can use external tools and memory mechanisms to solve complex real-world tasks, they may also introduce critical security vulnerabilities. However, the existing literature does not comprehensively evaluate attacks and defenses against LLM-based agents. To address this, we introduce Agent Security Bench (ASB), a comprehensive framework designed to formalize, benchmark, and evaluate the attacks and defenses of LLM-based agents, including 10 scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, autonomous driving, finance), 10 agents targeting the scenarios, over 400 tools, 27 different types of attack/defense methods, and 7 evaluation metrics. Based on ASB, we benchmark 10 prompt injection attacks, a memory poisoning attack, a novel Plan-of-Thought backdoor attack, 4 mixed attacks, and 11 corresponding defenses across 13 LLM backbones. Our benchmark results reveal critical vulnerabilities in different stages of agent operation, including system prompt, user prompt handling, tool usage, and memory retrieval, with the highest average attack success rate of 84.30\%, but limited effectiveness shown in current defenses, unveiling important works to be done in terms of agent security for the community. We also introduce a new metric to evaluate the agents' capability to balance utility and security. Our code can be found at https://github.com/agiresearch/ASB.

Abstract: Humanoid robotics faces significant challenges in achieving stable locomotion and recovering from falls in dynamic environments. Traditional methods, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Key Frame Based (KFB) routines, either require extensive fine-tuning or lack real-time adaptability. This paper introduces FRASA, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent that integrates fall recovery and stand up strategies into a unified framework. Leveraging the Cross-Q algorithm, FRASA significantly reduces training time and offers a versatile recovery strategy that adapts to unpredictable disturbances. Comparative tests on Sigmaban humanoid robots demonstrate FRASA superior performance against the KFB method deployed in the RoboCup 2023 by the Rhoban Team, world champion of the KidSize League.

Abstract: Handling heterogeneity and unpredictability are two core problems in pervasive computing. The challenge is to seamlessly integrate devices with varying computational resources in a dynamic environment to form a cohesive system that can fulfill the needs of all participants. Existing work on adaptive systems typically focuses on optimizing individual variables or low-level Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as constraining the usage of specific resources. While low-level control mechanisms permit fine-grained control over a system, they introduce considerable complexity, particularly in dynamic environments. To this end, we propose drawing from Active Inference (AIF), a neuroscientific framework for designing adaptive agents. Specifically, we introduce a conceptual agent for heterogeneous pervasive systems that permits setting global systems constraints as high-level SLOs. Instead of manually setting low-level SLOs, the system finds an equilibrium that can adapt to environmental changes. We demonstrate the viability of our AIF agents with an extensive experiment design, using heterogeneous and lifelong federated learning as an application scenario. We conduct our experiments on a physical testbed of devices with different resource types and vendor specifications. The results provide convincing evidence that an AIF agent can adapt a system to environmental changes. In particular, the AIF agent can balance competing SLOs in resource heterogeneous environments to ensure up to 98% fulfillment rate.

Abstract: Advancements in intelligent technologies have significantly improved navigation in complex traffic environments by enhancing environment perception and trajectory prediction for automated vehicles. However, current research often overlooks the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks explainability in trajectory prediction models, limiting their practical use in real-world situations. To address this, we introduce the Explainable Conditional Diffusion-based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction (DMTP) model, which is designed to elucidate the environmental factors influencing predictions and reveal the underlying mechanisms. Our model integrates a modified conditional diffusion approach to capture multimodal trajectory patterns and employs a revised Shapley Value model to assess the significance of global and scenario-specific features. Experiments using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our explainable model excels in identifying critical inputs and significantly outperforms baseline models in accuracy. Moreover, the factors identified align with the human driving experience, underscoring the model's effectiveness in learning accurate predictions.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) expand into performing as agents for real-world applications beyond traditional NLP tasks, evaluating their robustness becomes increasingly important. However, existing benchmarks often overlook critical dimensions like cultural and social awareness. To address these, we introduce CASA, a benchmark designed to assess LLM agents' sensitivity to cultural and social norms across two web-based tasks: online shopping and social discussion forums. Our approach evaluates LLM agents' ability to detect and appropriately respond to norm-violating user queries and observations. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that measures awareness coverage, helpfulness in managing user queries, and the violation rate when facing misleading web content. Experiments show that current LLMs perform significantly better in non-agent than in web-based agent environments, with agents achieving less than 10% awareness coverage and over 40% violation rates. To improve performance, we explore two methods: prompting and fine-tuning, and find that combining both methods can offer complementary advantages -- fine-tuning on culture-specific datasets significantly enhances the agents' ability to generalize across different regions, while prompting boosts the agents' ability to navigate complex tasks. These findings highlight the importance of constantly benchmarking LLM agents' cultural and social awareness during the development cycle.

Abstract: Recently, quadrupedal locomotion has achieved significant success, but their manipulation capabilities, particularly in handling large objects, remain limited, restricting their usefulness in demanding real-world applications such as search and rescue, construction, industrial automation, and room organization. This paper tackles the task of obstacle-aware, long-horizon pushing by multiple quadrupedal robots. We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with three levels of control. The high-level controller integrates an RRT planner and a centralized adaptive policy to generate subgoals, while the mid-level controller uses a decentralized goal-conditioned policy to guide the robots toward these sub-goals. A pre-trained low-level locomotion policy executes the movement commands. We evaluate our method against several baselines in simulation, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches, with 36.0% higher success rates and 24.5% reduction in completion time than the best baseline. Our framework successfully enables long-horizon, obstacle-aware manipulation tasks like Push-Cuboid and Push-T on Go1 robots in the real world.

Abstract: Learning to forecast trajectories of intelligent agents has caught much more attention recently. However, it remains a challenge to accurately account for agents' intentions and social behaviors when forecasting, and in particular, to simulate the unique randomness within each of those components in an explainable and decoupled way. Inspired by vibration systems and their resonance properties, we propose the Resonance (short for Re) model to encode and forecast pedestrian trajectories in the form of ``co-vibrations''. It decomposes trajectory modifications and randomnesses into multiple vibration portions to simulate agents' reactions to each single cause, and forecasts trajectories as the superposition of these independent vibrations separately. Also, benefiting from such vibrations and their spectral properties, representations of social interactions can be learned by emulating the resonance phenomena, further enhancing its explainability. Experiments on multiple datasets have verified its usefulness both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Reliable spatial and motion perception is essential for safe autonomous navigation. Recently, class-agnostic motion prediction on bird's-eye view (BEV) cell grids derived from LiDAR point clouds has gained significant attention. However, existing frameworks typically perform cell classification and motion prediction on a per-pixel basis, neglecting important motion field priors such as rigidity constraints, temporal consistency, and future interactions between agents. These limitations lead to degraded performance, particularly in sparse and distant regions. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{PriorMotion}, an innovative generative framework designed for class-agnostic motion prediction that integrates essential motion priors by modeling them as distributions within a structured latent space. Specifically, our method captures structured motion priors using raster-vector representations and employs a variational autoencoder with distinct dynamic and static components to learn future motion distributions in the latent space. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that \textbf{PriorMotion} outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both traditional metrics and our newly proposed evaluation criteria. Notably, we achieve improvements of approximately 15.24\% in accuracy for fast-moving objects, an 3.59\% increase in generalization, a reduction of 0.0163 in motion stability, and a 31.52\% reduction in prediction errors in distant regions. Further validation on FMCW LiDAR sensors confirms the robustness of our approach.

Abstract: We present the first loss agent, dubbed LossAgent, for low-level image processing tasks, e.g., image super-resolution and restoration, intending to achieve any customized optimization objectives of low-level image processing in different practical applications. Notably, not all optimization objectives, such as complex hand-crafted perceptual metrics, text description, and intricate human feedback, can be instantiated with existing low-level losses, e.g., MSE loss, which presents a crucial challenge in optimizing image processing networks in an end-to-end manner. To eliminate this, our LossAgent introduces the powerful large language model (LLM) as the loss agent, where the rich textual understanding of prior knowledge empowers the loss agent with the potential to understand complex optimization objectives, trajectory, and state feedback from external environments in the optimization process of the low-level image processing networks. In particular, we establish the loss repository by incorporating existing loss functions that support the end-to-end optimization for low-level image processing. Then, we design the optimization-oriented prompt engineering for the loss agent to actively and intelligently decide the compositional weights for each loss in the repository at each optimization interaction, thereby achieving the required optimization trajectory for any customized optimization objectives. Extensive experiments on three typical low-level image processing tasks and multiple optimization objectives have shown the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed LossAgent.

Abstract: Software engineers frequently grapple with the challenge of accessing disparate documentation and telemetry data, including TroubleShooting Guides (TSGs), incident reports, code repositories, and various internal tools developed by multiple stakeholders. While on-call duties are inevitable, incident resolution becomes even more daunting due to the obscurity of legacy sources and the pressures of strict time constraints. To enhance the efficiency of on-call engineers (OCEs) and streamline their daily workflows, we introduced DECO-a comprehensive framework for developing, deploying, and managing enterprise-grade copilots tailored to improve productivity in engineering routines. This paper details the design and implementation of the DECO framework, emphasizing its innovative NL2SearchQuery functionality and a lightweight agentic framework. These features support efficient and customized retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) algorithms that not only extract relevant information from diverse sources but also select the most pertinent skills in response to user queries. This enables the addressing of complex technical questions and provides seamless, automated access to internal resources. Additionally, DECO incorporates a robust mechanism for converting unstructured incident logs into user-friendly, structured guides, effectively bridging the documentation gap.
  Since its launch in September 2023, DECO has demonstrated its effectiveness through widespread adoption, enabling tens of thousands of interactions and engaging hundreds of monthly active users (MAU) across dozens of organizations within the company.

Abstract: Long video understanding poses unique challenges due to their temporal complexity and low information density. Recent works address this task by sampling numerous frames or incorporating auxiliary tools using LLMs, both of which result in high computational costs. In this work, we introduce a curiosity-driven video agent with self-exploration capability, dubbed as VCA. Built upon VLMs, VCA autonomously navigates video segments and efficiently builds a comprehensive understanding of complex video sequences. Instead of directly sampling frames, VCA employs a tree-search structure to explore video segments and collect frames. Rather than relying on external feedback or reward, VCA leverages VLM's self-generated intrinsic reward to guide its exploration, enabling it to capture the most crucial information for reasoning. Experimental results on multiple long video benchmarks demonstrate our approach's superior effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: We propose CAD-Assistant, a general-purpose CAD agent for AI-assisted design. Our approach is based on a powerful Vision and Large Language Model (VLLM) as a planner and a tool-augmentation paradigm using CAD-specific tools. CAD-Assistant addresses multimodal user queries by generating actions that are iteratively executed on a Python interpreter equipped with the FreeCAD software, accessed via its Python API. Our framework is able to assess the impact of generated CAD commands on geometry and adapts subsequent actions based on the evolving state of the CAD design. We consider a wide range of CAD-specific tools including a sketch image parameterizer, rendering modules, a 2D cross-section generator, and other specialized routines. CAD-Assistant is evaluated on multiple CAD benchmarks, where it outperforms VLLM baselines and supervised task-specific methods. Beyond existing benchmarks, we qualitatively demonstrate the potential of tool-augmented VLLMs as general-purpose CAD solvers across diverse workflows.

Abstract: A world model provides an agent with a representation of its environment, enabling it to predict the causal consequences of its actions. Current world models typically cannot directly and explicitly imitate the actual environment in front of a robot, often resulting in unrealistic behaviors and hallucinations that make them unsuitable for real-world robotics applications. To overcome those challenges, we propose to rethink robot world models as learnable digital twins. We introduce DreMa, a new approach for constructing digital twins automatically using learned explicit representations of the real world and its dynamics, bridging the gap between traditional digital twins and world models. DreMa replicates the observed world and its structure by integrating Gaussian Splatting and physics simulators, allowing robots to imagine novel configurations of objects and to predict the future consequences of robot actions thanks to its compositionality. We leverage this capability to generate new data for imitation learning by applying equivariant transformations to a small set of demonstrations. Our evaluations across various settings demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and robustness by incrementing actions and object distributions, reducing the data needed to learn a policy and improving the generalization of the agents. As a highlight, we show that a real Franka Emika Panda robot, powered by DreMa's imagination, can successfully learn novel physical tasks from just a single example per task variation (one-shot policy learning).

Abstract: Training on diverse, internet-scale data is a key factor in the success of recent large foundation models. Yet, using the same recipe for building embodied agents has faced noticeable difficulties. Despite the availability of many crowd-sourced embodied datasets, their action spaces often exhibit significant heterogeneity due to distinct physical embodiment and control interfaces for different robots, causing substantial challenges in developing embodied foundation models using cross-domain data. In this paper, we introduce UniAct, a new embodied foundation modeling framework operating in a Universal Action Space. Our learned universal actions capture the generic atomic behaviors across diverse robots by exploiting their shared structural features, and enable enhanced cross-domain data utilization and cross-embodiment generalizations by eliminating the notorious heterogeneity. The universal actions can be efficiently translated back to heterogeneous actionable commands by simply adding embodiment-specific details, from which fast adaptation to new robots becomes simple and straightforward. Our 0.5B instantiation of UniAct outperforms 14X larger SOTA embodied foundation models in extensive evaluations on various real-world and simulation robots, showcasing exceptional cross-embodiment control and adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of adopting universal actions.

Abstract: Generating full-body human gestures based on speech signals remains challenges on quality and speed. Existing approaches model different body regions such as body, legs and hands separately, which fail to capture the spatial interactions between them and result in unnatural and disjointed movements. Additionally, their autoregressive/diffusion-based pipelines show slow generation speed due to dozens of inference steps. To address these two challenges, we propose GestureLSM, a flow-matching-based approach for Co-Speech Gesture Generation with spatial-temporal modeling. Our method i) explicitly model the interaction of tokenized body regions through spatial and temporal attention, for generating coherent full-body gestures. ii) introduce the flow matching to enable more efficient sampling by explicitly modeling the latent velocity space. To overcome the suboptimal performance of flow matching baseline, we propose latent shortcut learning and beta distribution time stamp sampling during training to enhance gesture synthesis quality and accelerate inference. Combining the spatial-temporal modeling and improved flow matching-based framework, GestureLSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on BEAT2 while significantly reducing inference time compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential for enhancing digital humans and embodied agents in real-world applications.

Abstract: Interactive digital agents (IDAs) leverage APIs of stateful digital environments to perform tasks in response to user requests. While IDAs powered by instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) can react to feedback from interface invocations in multi-step exchanges, they have not been trained in their respective digital environments. Prior methods accomplish less than half of tasks in sophisticated benchmarks such as AppWorld. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains IDAs directly in their target environments. We formalize this training as a partially observable Markov decision process and derive LOOP, a data- and memory-efficient variant of proximal policy optimization. LOOP uses no value network and maintains exactly one copy of the underlying LLM in memory, making its implementation straightforward and as memory-efficient as fine-tuning a single LLM. A 32-billion-parameter agent trained with LOOP in the AppWorld environment outperforms the much larger OpenAI o1 agent by 9 percentage points (15% relative). To our knowledge, this is the first reported application of RL to IDAs that interact with a stateful, multi-domain, multi-app environment via direct API calls. Our analysis sheds light on the effectiveness of RL in this area, showing that the agent learns to consult the API documentation, avoid unwarranted assumptions, minimize confabulation, and recover from setbacks.

Abstract: Time series data is essential in various applications, including climate modeling, healthcare monitoring, and financial analytics. Understanding the contextual information associated with real-world time series data is often essential for accurate and reliable event predictions. In this paper, we introduce TimeCAP, a time-series processing framework that creatively employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as contextualizers of time series data, extending their typical usage as predictors. TimeCAP incorporates two independent LLM agents: one generates a textual summary capturing the context of the time series, while the other uses this enriched summary to make more informed predictions. In addition, TimeCAP employs a multi-modal encoder that synergizes with the LLM agents, enhancing predictive performance through mutual augmentation of inputs with in-context examples. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeCAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods for time series event prediction, including those utilizing LLMs as predictors, achieving an average improvement of 28.75% in F1 score.

Abstract: We introduce a novel non-cooperative game to analyse opinion formation and resistance, incorporating principles from social psychology such as confirmation bias, resource constraints, and influence penalties. Our simulation features Large Language Model (LLM) agents competing to influence a population, with penalties imposed for generating messages that propagate or counter misinformation. This framework integrates resource optimisation into the agents' decision-making process. Our findings demonstrate that while higher confirmation bias strengthens opinion alignment within groups, it also exacerbates overall polarisation. Conversely, lower confirmation bias leads to fragmented opinions and limited shifts in individual beliefs. Investing heavily in a high-resource debunking strategy can initially align the population with the debunking agent, but risks rapid resource depletion and diminished long-term influence.

arXiv:2404.03227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of sampling and remote estimation for autoregressive Markovian processes in a multi-hop wireless network with statistically-identical agents. Agents cache the most recent samples from others and communicate over wireless collision channels governed by an underlying graph topology. Our goal is to minimize time-average estimation error and/or age of information with decentralized scalable sampling and transmission policies, considering both oblivious (where decision-making is independent of the physical processes) and non-oblivious policies (where decision-making depends on physical processes). We prove that in oblivious policies, minimizing estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the age of information. The complexity of the problem, especially the multi-dimensional action spaces and arbitrary network topologies, makes theoretical methods for finding optimal transmission policies intractable. We optimize the policies using a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, where each agent employs a permutation-equivariant graph neural network architecture. Theoretically, we prove that our proposed framework exhibits desirable transferability properties, allowing transmission policies trained on small- or moderate-size networks to be executed effectively on large-scale topologies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) The trained policies are transferable to larger networks, and their performance gains increase with the number of agents; (iii) The training procedure withstands non-stationarity even if we utilize independent learning techniques; and, (iv) Recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity in independent learning.

<title>Federated Q-Learning with Reference-Advantage Decomposition: Almost Optimal Regret and Logarithmic Communication Cost</title>

arXiv:2405.18795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider model-free federated reinforcement learning for tabular episodic Markov decision processes. Under the coordination of a central server, multiple agents collaboratively explore the environment and learn an optimal policy without sharing their raw data. Despite recent advances in federated Q-learning algorithms achieving near-linear regret speedup with low communication cost, existing algorithms only attain suboptimal regrets compared to the information bound. We propose a novel model-free federated Q-learning algorithm, termed FedQ-Advantage. Our algorithm leverages reference-advantage decomposition for variance reduction and operates under two distinct mechanisms: synchronization between the agents and the server, and policy update, both triggered by events. We prove that our algorithm not only requires a lower logarithmic communication cost but also achieves an almost optimal regret, reaching the information bound up to a logarithmic factor and near-linear regret speedup compared to its single-agent counterpart when the time horizon is sufficiently large.

Abstract: Previous work indicates evidence that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays a crucial role in brain waste clearance processes, and that altered flow patterns are associated with various diseases of the central nervous system. In this study, we investigate the potential of deep learning to predict the distribution in human brain of a gadolinium-based CSF contrast agent (tracer) administered intrathecal. For this, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans taken at multiple time points before and after injection were utilized. We propose a U-net-based supervised learning model to predict pixel-wise signal increase at its peak after 24 hours. Performance is evaluated based on different tracer distribution stages provided during training, including predictions from baseline scans taken before injection. Our findings show that training with imaging data from only the first two hours post-injection yields tracer flow predictions comparable to models trained with additional later-stage scans. Validation against ventricular reflux gradings from neuroradiologists confirmed alignment with expert evaluations. These results demonstrate that deep learning-based methods for CSF flow prediction deserve more attention, as minimizing MR imaging without compromising clinical analysis could enhance efficiency, improve patient well-being, and lower healthcare costs.

Abstract: This paper focuses on decentralized stochastic bilevel optimization (DSBO) where agents only communicate with their neighbors. We propose Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent and Ascent with Gradient Tracking (DSGDA-GT), a novel algorithm that only requires first-order oracles that are much cheaper than second-order oracles widely adopted in existing works. We further provide a finite-time convergence analysis showing that for $n$ agents collaboratively solving the DSBO problem, the sample complexity of finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point in our algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1}\epsilon^{-7})$, which matches the currently best-known results of the single-agent counterpart with linear speedup. The numerical experiments demonstrate both the communication and training efficiency of our algorithm.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of chemical reaction yields is crucial for optimizing organic synthesis, potentially reducing time and resources spent on experimentation. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there is growing interest in leveraging AI-based methods to accelerate yield predictions without conducting in vitro experiments. We present log-RRIM, an innovative graph transformer-based framework designed for predicting chemical reaction yields. A key feature of log-RRIM is its integration of a cross-attention mechanism that focuses on the interplay between reagents and reaction centers. This design reflects a fundamental principle in chemical reactions: the crucial role of reagents in influencing bond-breaking and formation processes, which ultimately affect reaction yields. log-RRIM also implements a local-to-global reaction representation learning strategy. This approach initially captures detailed molecule-level information and then models and aggregates intermolecular interactions. Through this hierarchical process, log-RRIM effectively captures how different molecular fragments contribute to and influence the overall reaction yield, regardless of their size variations. log-RRIM shows superior performance in our experiments, especially for medium to high-yielding reactions, proving its reliability as a predictor. The framework's sophisticated modeling of reactant-reagent interactions and precise capture of molecular fragment contributions make it a valuable tool for reaction planning and optimization in chemical synthesis. The data and codes of log-RRIM are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/Yield_log_RRIM.

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to volume ratio prediction in financial markets, specifically targeting the execution of Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) strategies. Recognizing the importance of accurate volume profile forecasting, our research leverages the Transformer architecture to predict intraday volume ratio at a one-minute scale. We diverge from prior models that use log-transformed volume or turnover rates, instead opting for a prediction model that accounts for the intraday volume ratio's high variability, stabilized via log-normal transformation. Our input data incorporates not only the statistical properties of volume but also external volume-related features, absolute time information, and stock-specific characteristics to enhance prediction accuracy. The model structure includes an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture with a distribution head for greedy sampling, optimizing performance on high-liquidity stocks across both Korean and American markets. We extend the capabilities of our model beyond point prediction by introducing probabilistic forecasting that captures the mean and standard deviation of volume ratios, enabling the anticipation of significant intraday volume spikes. Furthermore, an agent with a simple trading logic demonstrates the practical application of our model through live trading tests in the Korean market, outperforming VWAP benchmarks over a period of two and a half months. Our findings underscore the potential of Transformer-based probabilistic models for volume ratio prediction and pave the way for future research advancements in this domain.

Abstract: Many societal challenges, such as climate change or disease outbreaks, require coordinated behavioral changes. For many behaviors, the tendency of individuals to adhere to social norms can reinforce the status quo. However, these same social processes can also result in rapid, self-reinforcing change. Interventions may be strategically targeted to initiate endogenous social change processes, often referred to as social tipping. While recent research has considered how the size and targeting of such interventions impact their effectiveness at bringing about change, they tend to overlook constraints faced by policymakers, including the cost, speed, and distributional consequences of interventions. To address this complexity, we introduce a game-theoretic framework that includes heterogeneous agents and networks of local influence. We implement various targeting heuristics based on information about individual preferences and commonly used local network properties to identify individuals to incentivize. Analytical and simulation results suggest that there is a trade-off between preventing backsliding among targeted individuals and promoting change among non-targeted individuals. Thus, where the change is initiated in the population and the direction in which it propagates is essential to the effectiveness of interventions. We identify cost-optimal strategies under different scenarios, such as varying levels of resistance to change, preference heterogeneity, and homophily. These results provide insights that can be experimentally tested and help policymakers to better direct incentives.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) tasks are vital for automating workflows such as software testing, user interface navigation. For users, the GUI is the most intuitive platform for interacting with a computer. Previous work identified a key challenge in developing visual GUI agents: GUI grounding - the ability to accurately locate screen elements based on instructions. However, most existing GUI agents rely on structured data formats like DOM or HTML files in training or inferencing, which are inaccessible across all applications, particular in a general desktop environments such as Windows OS. To address this, we introduce WinClick, a novel visual GUI agent developed in Windows platform. WinClick leverages screenshots to detect actionable regions. To overcome the challenge of GUI grounding, we enhance WinClick with GUI grounding pre-training and propose an LLM-based method for aligning GUI grounding data. Additionally, we introduce WinSpot, the first comprehensive benchmark for GUI grounding on Windows. Our experiments demonstrate that WinClick, combined with GUI grounding pre-training, significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a scalable solution for GUI automation in desktop environments. WinSpot is publicly available at https://github.com/zackhuiiiii/WinSpot.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, necessitating a deeper understanding of their decision-making behaviour under risk. This study investigates the relationship between LLMs' personality traits and risk propensity, employing cumulative prospect theory (CPT) and the Big Five personality framework. We focus on GPT-4o, comparing its behaviour to human baselines and earlier models. Our findings reveal that GPT-4o exhibits higher Conscientiousness and Agreeableness traits compared to human averages, while functioning as a risk-neutral rational agent in prospect selection. Interventions on GPT-4o's Big Five traits, particularly Openness, significantly influence its risk propensity, mirroring patterns observed in human studies. Notably, Openness emerges as the most influential factor in GPT-4o's risk propensity, aligning with human findings. In contrast, legacy models like GPT-4-Turbo demonstrate inconsistent generalization of the personality-risk relationship. This research advances our understanding of LLM behaviour under risk and elucidates the potential and limitations of personality-based interventions in shaping LLM decision-making. Our findings have implications for the development of more robust and predictable AI systems such as financial modelling.

Abstract: With the rise of large multi-modal AI models, fuelled by recent interest in large language models (LLMs), the notion of artificial general intelligence (AGI) went from being restricted to a fringe community, to dominate mainstream large AI development programs.
  In contrast, in this paper, we make a \emph{case for specialisation}, by reviewing the pitfalls of generality and stressing the industrial value of specialised
  systems.
  Our contribution is threefold. First, we review the most widely accepted arguments \emph{against} specialisation, and discuss how their relevance in the context of human labour is actually an argument \emph{for} specialisation in the case of non human agents, be they algorithms or human organisations. Second, we propose four arguments \emph{in favor of} specialisation, ranging from machine learning robustness, to computer security, social sciences and cultural evolution.
  Third, we finally make a case for \emph{specification}, discuss how the machine learning approach to AI has so far failed to catch up with good practices from safety-engineering and formal verification of software, and discuss how some emerging good practices in machine learning help reduce this gap.
  In particular, we justify the need for \emph{specified governance} for hard-to-specify systems.

Abstract: This position paper argues that AI agents should be regulated based on the sequence of actions they autonomously take. AI agents with long-term planning and strategic capabilities can pose significant risks of human extinction and irreversible global catastrophes. While existing regulations often focus on computational scale as a proxy for potential harm, we contend that such measures are insufficient for assessing the risks posed by AI agents whose capabilities arise primarily from inference-time computation. To support our position, we discuss relevant regulations and recommendations from AI scientists regarding existential risks, as well as the advantages of action sequences over existing impact measures that require observing environmental states.

Abstract: On-demand ride-hailing services like DiDi, Uber, and Lyft have transformed urban transportation, offering unmatched convenience and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce DiMA, an LLM-powered ride-hailing assistant deployed in DiDi Chuxing. Its goal is to provide seamless ride-hailing services and beyond through a natural and efficient conversational interface under dynamic and complex spatiotemporal urban contexts. To achieve this, we propose a spatiotemporal-aware order planning module that leverages external tools for precise spatiotemporal reasoning and progressive order planning. Additionally, we develop a cost-effective dialogue system that integrates multi-type dialog repliers with cost-aware LLM configurations to handle diverse conversation goals and trade-off response quality and latency. Furthermore, we introduce a continual fine-tuning scheme that utilizes real-world interactions and simulated dialogues to align the assistant's behavior with human preferred decision-making processes. Since its deployment in the DiDi application, DiMA has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 93% accuracy in order planning and 92% in response generation during real-world interactions. Offline experiments further validate DiMA capabilities, showing improvements of up to 70.23% in order planning and 321.27% in response generation compared to three state-of-the-art agent frameworks, while reducing latency by $0.72\times$ to $5.47\times$. These results establish DiMA as an effective, efficient, and intelligent mobile assistant for ride-hailing services.

总结:
本文提出了一个两阶段解决方案，旨在提升大型语言模型在对话交流中的社交和对话智能，使其更接近人类表现。第一阶段，研究者设计了一个多模块框架，包括用于推理的思考模块、用于知识管理和外部信息获取的资源模块以及生成情境适当交互的响应模块。这些模块协同工作，使AI代理能够提供更为人性化的对话体验。第二阶段（留作未来工作）计划利用经过过滤和标注后的对话数据进行强化学习训练，进一步捕捉人类偏好。实验结果显示，志愿者与基于该框架集成的同款大型语言模型的AI角色进行了超过3000轮对话，评价者认为该框架显著提升了AI的社交和对话智能，而且无需对大型语言模型进行微调。 <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), due to their advanced natural language capabilities, have seen significant success in applications where the user interface is usually a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) agent and engages the user through multi-round conversations. However, many scenarios require the agents to exhibit stronger social and conversational intelligence and demonstrate more human-like (anthropomorphic) reactions. This is an aspect that foundational LLMs have yet to fully address such that a single call of foundational models might be insufficient.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage solution. In this work, we focus on the first stage, introducing a multi-module framework designed to replicate the key aspects of human intelligence involved in conversations. This framework comprises thinking modules for reasoning, resource modules for managing knowledge and external information, and response modules for generating contextually appropriate interactions. With all the modules cooperating, the framework would empower the agents to provide a better human-like conversation experience. In the second stage of our approach, these conversational data, after filtering and labeling, can serve as training and testing data for reinforcement learning, enabling AI to better capture human preferences. This stage is left for future work.
  In our experiments, volunteers engaged in over 3000 rounds of conversation with the same AI character powered by a standalone LLM and our framework which integrates the same LLM. A separate group of evaluators rated the conversation samples, revealing that our framework significantly enhanced the social and conversational intelligence, even without fine-tuning the LLM.

<div> 关键词：四足机器人、运行时学习框架、深度强化学习、高保证教师、高性能学生<br /><br />总结:
本文提出了一种针对四足机器人的运行时学习框架，使它们能够在动态复杂环境中安全地学习和适应。该框架集成了感知、导航和控制，形成一个闭环系统。核心创新点在于控制器模块中的两个互动互补组件：高性能学生（HP-Student）与高保证教师（HA-Teacher）。HP-Student 是一种深度强化学习代理，通过自我学习和教学式学习来发展出安全高效的行为策略；而 HA-Teacher 是一个简化的、可验证的基于物理模型的控制器，其职责是教导 HP-Student 安全知识并为机器人的安全移动提供备用方案。HA-Teacher 创新性地具备实时物理模型、实时行为策略以及实时控制目标，使其能有效应对实际环境中的动态挑战，确保安全性。此外，框架中还包括一个协调器，用于有效地管理 HP-Student 和 HA-Teacher 之间的交互。实验表明，该提出的运行时学习框架在Unitree Go2机器人在Nvidia Isaac Gym环境下的表现优于现有的安全深度强化学习方法。 <div>
arXiv:2503.04794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a runtime learning framework for quadruped robots, enabling them to learn and adapt safely in dynamic wild environments. The framework integrates sensing, navigation, and control, forming a closed-loop system for the robot. The core novelty of this framework lies in two interactive and complementary components within the control module: the high-performance (HP)-Student and the high-assurance (HA)-Teacher. HP-Student is a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent that engages in self-learning and teaching-to-learn to develop a safe and high-performance action policy. HA-Teacher is a simplified yet verifiable physics-model-based controller, with the role of teaching HP-Student about safety while providing a backup for the robot's safe locomotion. HA-Teacher is innovative due to its real-time physics model, real-time action policy, and real-time control goals, all tailored to respond effectively to real-time wild environments, ensuring safety. The framework also includes a coordinator who effectively manages the interaction between HP-Student and HA-Teacher. Experiments involving a Unitree Go2 robot in Nvidia Isaac Gym and comparisons with state-of-the-art safe DRLs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed runtime learning framework.

<div> 关键词: Scalable Multi-Agent Realistic Testbed (SMART), Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), 物理引擎模拟器, 执行监控框架, 行动依赖图<br /><br />总结:
本文介绍了Scalable Multi-Agent Realistic Testbed (SMART)，这是一个用于评估Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)算法的真实感和高效的软件工具。SMART着重于规划一组智能体的碰撞避免路径。尽管现有的MAPF算法能在几秒内为数百台机器人规划路径，但它们通常依赖简化的机器人模型，使其在真实世界中的性能不明确。为了填补这一空白，SMART提供了三个主要优势：(1) 使用基于物理引擎的模拟器创建真实的仿真环境，考虑了如机器人动力学和执行不确定性等复杂的真实世界因素；(2) 采用基于Action Dependency Graph的执行监控框架，方便与各种MAPF算法和机器人模型无缝集成；(3) 能够扩展到数千台机器人规模。此外，研究者还使用SMART探讨并展示了关于在实际场景中执行MAPF算法的相关研究问题。相关代码已公开发布在https://jingtianyan.github.io/publication/2025-smart。 <div>
arXiv:2503.04798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Scalable Multi-Agent Realistic Testbed (SMART), a realistic and efficient software tool for evaluating Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms. MAPF focuses on planning collision-free paths for a group of agents. While state-of-the-art MAPF algorithms can plan paths for hundreds of robots in seconds, they often rely on simplified robot models, making their real-world performance unclear. Researchers typically lack access to hundreds of physical robots in laboratory settings to evaluate the algorithms. Meanwhile, industrial professionals who lack expertise in MAPF require an easy-to-use simulator to efficiently test and understand the performance of MAPF algorithms in their specific settings. SMART fills this gap with several advantages: (1) SMART uses a physics-engine-based simulator to create realistic simulation environments, accounting for complex real-world factors such as robot kinodynamics and execution uncertainties, (2) SMART uses an execution monitor framework based on the Action Dependency Graph, facilitating seamless integration with various MAPF algorithms and robot models, and (3) SMART scales to thousands of robots. In addition, we use SMART to explore and demonstrate research questions about the execution of MAPF algorithms in real-world scenarios. The code is publicly available at https://jingtianyan.github.io/publication/2025-smart.

<div> 关键词：多智能体系统、叙事弧线、Grey's Anatomy、关系型数据库、语义数据库<br /><br />总结:<br />
本文提出了一种用于提取和分析电视剧复杂剧情线索的多智能体系统。该系统以美剧《实习医生格蕾》第一季为测试对象，识别出了三种叙事类型：单元剧（自包含）、肥皂剧（侧重人物关系）和类型特定剧（严格关联系列所属类型）。系统将这些剧情发展的阶段性进程分别存储在关系型和语义型数据库中，便于结构化分析与对比。为了平衡自动化与批判性解读，系统配备了一个图形界面，允许人类通过工具对数据进行细化增强和可视化。实验显示，系统在识别单元剧剧情弧线及角色实体方面表现出色，但在识别重叠剧情线及微妙动态方面存在局限，突显了结合计算技术和人类专家在叙事分析中的潜力。这种方法对于其他以文本形式连载的作品也同样具有应用前景。未来的工作将探索整合对话和视觉等多模态输入，并进一步扩大到更多类型的电视剧进行测试以优化该系统。 <div>
arXiv:2503.04817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serialized TV shows are built on complex storylines that can be hard to track and evolve in ways that defy straightforward analysis. This paper introduces a multi-agent system designed to extract and analyze these narrative arcs. Tested on the first season of Grey's Anatomy (ABC 2005-), the system identifies three types of arcs: Anthology (self-contained), Soap (relationship-focused), and Genre-Specific (strictly related to the series' genre). Episodic progressions of these arcs are stored in both relational and semantic (vectorial) databases, enabling structured analysis and comparison. To bridge the gap between automation and critical interpretation, the system is paired with a graphical interface that allows for human refinement using tools to enhance and visualize the data. The system performed strongly in identifying Anthology Arcs and character entities, but its reliance on textual paratexts (such as episode summaries) revealed limitations in recognizing overlapping arcs and subtler dynamics. This approach highlights the potential of combining computational and human expertise in narrative analysis. Beyond television, it offers promise for serialized written formats, where the narrative resides entirely in the text. Future work will explore the integration of multimodal inputs, such as dialogue and visuals, and expand testing across a wider range of genres to refine the system further.

本文提出了一种多智能体AI框架，旨在解决全球化背景下语言多样性的保护问题以及现有AI驱动翻译模型在捕捉文化差异上的不足。该框架专注于为弱势语言社区提供具有文化适应性的翻译服务，通过专门的代理进行翻译、解释、内容合成和偏见评估，以确保语言准确性和文化相关性得以保留。利用CrewAI和LangChain工具，系统增强了上下文保真度并减轻了翻译中的偏见。实验分析表明，该框架对比GPT-4展现出更优的表现，能够生成富含上下文信息和文化内涵的翻译结果，对于推动土著语言、区域语言和低资源语言的发展具有重要意义。这项研究强调了多智能体AI在构建公平、可持续且具有文化敏感性的自然语言处理技术方面所具有的潜力，符合《面向欠发达社区的语言模型》中关于AI治理、文化NLP和可持续NLP等原则。相关实验代码库已公开发布于：<br />https://github.com/ciol-researchlab/Context-Aware_Translation_MAS <div>
arXiv:2503.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language is a cornerstone of cultural identity, yet globalization and the dominance of major languages have placed nearly 3,000 languages at risk of extinction. Existing AI-driven translation models prioritize efficiency but often fail to capture cultural nuances, idiomatic expressions, and historical significance, leading to translations that marginalize linguistic diversity. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-agent AI framework designed for culturally adaptive translation in underserved language communities. Our approach leverages specialized agents for translation, interpretation, content synthesis, and bias evaluation, ensuring that linguistic accuracy and cultural relevance are preserved. Using CrewAI and LangChain, our system enhances contextual fidelity while mitigating biases through external validation. Comparative analysis shows that our framework outperforms GPT-4o, producing contextually rich and culturally embedded translations, a critical advancement for Indigenous, regional, and low-resource languages. This research underscores the potential of multi-agent AI in fostering equitable, sustainable, and culturally sensitive NLP technologies, aligning with the AI Governance, Cultural NLP, and Sustainable NLP pillars of Language Models for Underserved Communities.

总结:
本文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）构建的对话式购物代理（CSA）面临的两大挑战：生成不准确或无支持的言论以及缺乏信息来源引用。为解决这些问题，文章提出了一种可轻松投入生产的解决方案，该方案结合了上下文学习（ICL）和多用户体验推理（MUI），能在生成的回答中添加引用来源，同时不会影响其他现有用户体验功能。通过合理的用户界面设计，这些引用标记可以链接到相关产品信息，展示信息来源给顾客。此外，文中还建立了自动评估指标和可扩展的基准，以全面评价LLM的事实依据与归因能力。实验结果显示，采用这种引用生成范式能显著提升LLM响应的依据性达13.83%。因此，这一解决方案不仅解决了LLM的基础问题，也为对话式AI带来了更高的透明度。 <div>

Abstract: With the advancement of conversational large language models (LLMs), several LLM-based Conversational Shopping Agents (CSA) have been developed to help customers answer questions and smooth their shopping journey in e-commerce domain. The primary objective in building a trustworthy CSA is to ensure the agent's responses are accurate and factually grounded, which is essential for building customer trust and encouraging continuous engagement. However, two challenges remain. First, LLMs produce hallucinated or unsupported claims. Such inaccuracies risk spreading misinformation and diminishing customer trust. Second, without providing knowledge source attribution in CSA response, customers struggle to verify LLM-generated information. To address these challenges, we present an easily productionized solution that enables a "citation experience" utilizing In-context Learning (ICL) and Multi-UX-Inference (MUI) to generate responses with citations to attribute its original sources without interfering other existing UX features. With proper UX design, these citation marks can be linked to the related product information and display the source to our customers. In this work, we also build auto-metrics and scalable benchmarks to holistically evaluate LLM's grounding and attribution capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating this citation generation paradigm can substantially enhance the grounding of LLM responses by 13.83% on the real-world data. As such, our solution not only addresses the immediate challenges of LLM grounding issues but also adds transparency to conversational AI.

总结:
本文针对机器人在动态、不确定环境（即“开放世界”）中快速适应的挑战，提出了一个混合规划与学习系统。该系统整合了两种模型：一种是以神经网络为基础的低级模型，通过内在好奇心模块（ICM）学习随机过渡并驱动探索；另一种是高级符号规划模型，利用操作符捕获抽象过渡，使代理能在“想象”空间中进行计划并生成奖励机器。在具有序列新颖性注入的机器人操纵领域的评估中，该方法表现出更快的收敛速度，并优于现有的先进混合方法。<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Adapting quickly to dynamic, uncertain environments-often called "open worlds"-remains a major challenge in robotics. Traditional Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches struggle to cope with unforeseen changes, are data-inefficient when adapting, and do not leverage world models during learning. We address this issue with a hybrid planning and learning system that integrates two models: a low level neural network based model that learns stochastic transitions and drives exploration via an Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM), and a high level symbolic planning model that captures abstract transitions using operators, enabling the agent to plan in an "imaginary" space and generate reward machines. Our evaluation in a robotic manipulation domain with sequential novelty injections demonstrates that our approach converges faster and outperforms state-of-the-art hybrid methods.

总结:
本文提出了一个名为VQEL的新方法，重点关注在自主语言学习领域中，使代理能在自我游戏中发明和发展离散符号表征。传统的研究主要集中在通过多智能体间的交互建立通信协议，而对内部语言学习——即语言作为个体思考、自我反思和问题解决工具的作用——关注不足。VQEL通过将向量量化引入代理的架构，使得代理能够在没有其他代理参与的情况下进行自我游戏并习得符号表示。随后，代理可以通过强化学习以及与其他代理在互惠游戏阶段的互动来进一步提升其语言能力。实验表明，与传统的REINFORCE方法相比，VQEL不仅表现出优越性，还由于向量量化的应用而具备更好的控制力和减少崩溃的风险。 <div>
arXiv:2503.04940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of emergent language, efforts have traditionally focused on developing communication protocols through interactions between agents in referential games. However, the aspect of internal language learning, where language serves not only as a communicative tool with others but also as a means for individual thinking, self-reflection, and problem-solving remains underexplored. Developing a language through self-play, without another agent's involvement, poses a unique challenge. It requires an agent to craft symbolic representations and train them using direct gradient methods. The challenge here is that if an agent attempts to learn symbolic representations through self-play using conventional modeling and techniques such as REINFORCE, the solution will offer no advantage over previous multi-agent approaches. We introduce VQEL, a novel method that incorporates Vector Quantization into the agents' architecture, enabling them to autonomously invent and develop discrete symbolic representations in a self-play referential game. Following the self-play phase, agents can enhance their language through reinforcement learning and interactions with other agents in the mutual-play phase. Our experiments across various datasets demonstrate that VQEL not only outperforms the traditional REINFORCE method but also benefits from improved control and reduced susceptibility to collapse, thanks to the incorporation of vector quantization.

arXiv:2503.04952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction of road agents (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles) is an essential prerequisite for various intelligent systems applications, such as autonomous driving and robotic navigation. Recent research highlights the importance of environmental contexts (e.g., maps) and the "multi-modality" of trajectories, leading to increasingly complex model structures. However, real-world deployments require lightweight models that can quickly migrate and adapt to new environments. Additionally, the core motivations of road agents, referred to as their intentions, deserves further exploration. In this study, we advocate that understanding and reasoning road agents' intention plays a key role in trajectory prediction tasks, and the main challenge is that the concept of intention is fuzzy and abstract. To this end, we present INTENT, an efficient intention-guided trajectory prediction model that relies solely on information contained in the road agent's trajectory. Our model distinguishes itself from existing models in several key aspects: (i) We explicitly model road agents' intentions through contrastive clustering, accommodating the fuzziness and abstraction of human intention in their trajectories. (ii) The proposed INTENT is based solely on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), resulting in reduced training and inference time, making it very efficient and more suitable for real-world deployment. (iii) By leveraging estimated intentions and an innovative algorithm for transforming trajectory observations, we obtain more robust trajectory representations that lead to superior prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world trajectory datasets for pedestrians and autonomous vehicles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of INTENT.

arXiv:2503.04954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lacking security awareness, sensor fusion in systems with multi-agent networks such as smart cities is vulnerable to attacks. To guard against recent threats, we design security-aware sensor fusion that is based on the estimates of distributions over trust. Trust estimation can be cast as a hidden Markov model, and we solve it by mapping sensor data to trust pseudomeasurements (PSMs) that recursively update trust posteriors in a Bayesian context. Trust then feeds sensor fusion to facilitate trust-weighted updates to situational awareness. Essential to security-awareness are a novel field of view estimator, logic to map sensor data into PSMs, and the derivation of efficient Bayesian updates. We evaluate security-aware fusion under attacks on agents using case studies and Monte Carlo simulation in the physics-based Unreal Engine simulator, CARLA. A mix of novel and classical security-relevant metrics show that our security-aware fusion enables building trustworthy situational awareness even in hostile conditions.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are becoming increasingly proficient at solving web-based tasks. With this capability comes a greater risk of misuse for malicious purposes, such as posting misinformation in an online forum or selling illicit substances on a website. To evaluate these risks, we propose SafeArena, the first benchmark to focus on the deliberate misuse of web agents. SafeArena comprises 250 safe and 250 harmful tasks across four websites. We classify the harmful tasks into five harm categories -- misinformation, illegal activity, harassment, cybercrime, and social bias, designed to assess realistic misuses of web agents. We evaluate leading LLM-based web agents, including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Qwen-2-VL 72B, and Llama-3.2 90B, on our benchmark. To systematically assess their susceptibility to harmful tasks, we introduce the Agent Risk Assessment framework that categorizes agent behavior across four risk levels. We find agents are surprisingly compliant with malicious requests, with GPT-4o and Qwen-2 completing 34.7% and 27.3% of harmful requests, respectively. Our findings highlight the urgent need for safety alignment procedures for web agents. Our benchmark is available here: https://safearena.github.io

Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of multi-agent informative path planning (IPP) for robots whose sensor visibility continuously changes as a consequence of a time-varying natural phenomenon. We leverage ergodic trajectory optimization (ETO), which generates paths such that the amount of time an agent spends in an area is proportional to the expected information in that area. We focus specifically on the problem of multi-agent drone search of a wildfire, where we use the time-varying environmental process of smoke diffusion to construct a sensor visibility model. This sensor visibility model is used to repeatedly calculate an expected information distribution (EID) to be used in the ETO algorithm. Our experiments show that our exploration method achieves improved information gathering over both baseline search methods and naive ergodic search formulations.

本研究关注于如何通过人性化设计方法来开发支持教师更广泛采纳AI工具的AI交互式教学代理。通过对五位教学专家的访谈，探讨了现有策略如何满足教师的教学需求。随后，组织了一场参与式设计研讨会，十位教学专家对针对不同AI认知水平和态度的教师设计的一款Chatbot故事板进行了评审，并评估了基于常见教学挑战的LLM生成的建议质量。研究发现，对于持保守态度的AI教师来说，建立信任感至关重要，同时强调需要社交透明度（如展示同行如何使用该工具）以及让教师灵活控制与系统的交互程度。此外，还提出了改进AI生成教学建议质量的设计建议，例如根据教师先前的教学经验进行调整。这项工作凸显出支持持保守态度的AI教师的迫切性，因为AI素养和态度密切相关。若不进行深思熟虑的设计，则有可能加剧教育鸿沟，减少学生的学习机会。 <div>

Abstract: Instructors play a pivotal role in integrating AI into education, yet their adoption of AI-powered tools remains inconsistent. Despite this, limited research explores how to design AI tools that support broader instructor adoption. This study applies a human-centered design approach, incorporating qualitative methods, to investigate the design of interactive pedagogical agents that provide instructional suggestions in response to instructors' questions. We conducted a formative study involving interviews with five pedagogy experts to examine existing strategies for supporting instructors' pedagogical needs. Building on these insights, we facilitated a participatory design session with ten pedagogy experts, where participants reviewed a storyboard depicting a chatbot designed for instructors with varying levels of AI literacy and differing attitudes toward AI. Experts also evaluated the quality of LLM-generated suggestions based on common teaching challenges. Our findings highlight the need for chatbot interactions that foster trust, especially for AI-conservative instructors. Experts emphasized the importance of social transparency (for example, showing how peers use the tool) and allowing instructors to flexibly control how much or how little they engage with the system. We also propose design recommendations to enhance the quality of AI-generated teaching suggestions, such as adapting them to reflect instructors' prior teaching experience. This work underscores the urgent need to support AI-conservative instructors, as AI literacy and attitudes are closely intertwined. Without thoughtful design, there is a risk of widening pedagogical divides and reducing students' learning opportunities.

Abstract: Teams of people coordinate to perform complex tasks by forming abstract mental models of world and agent dynamics. The use of abstract models contrasts with much recent work in robot learning that uses a high-fidelity simulator and reinforcement learning (RL) to obtain policies for physical robots. Motivated by this difference, we investigate the extent to which so-called abstract simulators can be used for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and the resulting policies successfully deployed on teams of physical robots. An abstract simulator models the robot's target task at a high-level of abstraction and discards many details of the world that could impact optimal decision-making. Policies are trained in an abstract simulator then transferred to the physical robot by making use of separately-obtained low-level perception and motion control modules. We identify three key categories of modifications to the abstract simulator that enable policy transfer to physical robots: simulation fidelity enhancements, training optimizations and simulation stochasticity. We then run an empirical study with extensive ablations to determine the value of each modification category for enabling policy transfer in cooperative robot soccer tasks. We also compare the performance of policies produced by our method with a well-tuned non-learning-based behavior architecture from the annual RoboCup competition and find that our approach leads to a similar level of performance. Broadly we show that MARL can be use to train cooperative physical robot behaviors using highly abstract models of the world.

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) aims to endow a single agent with the ability to perform well on multiple tasks. Recent works have focused on developing novel sophisticated architectures to improve performance, often resulting in larger models; it is unclear, however, whether the performance gains are a consequence of the architecture design itself or the extra parameters. We argue that gains are mostly due to scale by demonstrating that naively scaling up a simple MTRL baseline to match parameter counts outperforms the more sophisticated architectures, and these gains benefit most from scaling the critic over the actor. Additionally, we explore the training stability advantages that come with task diversity, demonstrating that increasing the number of tasks can help mitigate plasticity loss. Our findings suggest that MTRL's simultaneous training across multiple tasks provides a natural framework for beneficial parameter scaling in reinforcement learning, challenging the need for complex architectural innovations.

Abstract: Mobile agents have attracted tremendous research participation recently. Traditional approaches to mobile agent training rely on centralized data collection, leading to high cost and limited scalability. Distributed training utilizing federated learning offers an alternative by harnessing real-world user data, providing scalability and reducing costs. However, pivotal challenges, including the absence of standardized benchmarks, hinder progress in this field.
  To tackle the challenges, we introduce FedMABench, the first benchmark for federated training and evaluation of mobile agents, specifically designed for heterogeneous scenarios. FedMABench features 6 datasets with 30+ subsets, 8 federated algorithms, 10+ base models, and over 800 apps across 5 categories, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating mobile agents across diverse environments. Through extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: federated algorithms consistently outperform local training; the distribution of specific apps plays a crucial role in heterogeneity; and, even apps from distinct categories can exhibit correlations during training. FedMABench is publicly available at: https://github.com/wwh0411/FedMABench with the datasets at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/wwh0411/FedMABench.

Abstract: Proactive dialogue systems aim to empower chatbots with the capability of leading conversations towards specific targets, thereby enhancing user engagement and service autonomy. Existing systems typically target pre-defined keywords or entities, neglecting user attributes and preferences implicit in dialogue history, hindering the development of long-term user intimacy. To address these challenges, we take a radical step towards building a more human-like conversational agent by integrating proactive dialogue systems with long-term memory into a unified framework. Specifically, we define a novel task named Memory-aware Proactive Dialogue (MapDia). By decomposing the task, we then propose an automatic data construction method and create the first Chinese Memory-aware Proactive Dataset (ChMapData). Furthermore, we introduce a joint framework based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), featuring three modules: Topic Summarization, Topic Retrieval, and Proactive Topic-shifting Detection and Generation, designed to steer dialogues towards relevant historical topics at the right time. The effectiveness of our dataset and models is validated through both automatic and human evaluations. We release the open-source framework and dataset at https://github.com/FrontierLabs/MapDia.

Abstract: Effective trajectory stitching for long-horizon planning is a significant challenge in robotic decision-making. While diffusion models have shown promise in planning, they are limited to solving tasks similar to those seen in their training data. We propose CompDiffuser, a novel generative approach that can solve new tasks by learning to compositionally stitch together shorter trajectory chunks from previously seen tasks. Our key insight is modeling the trajectory distribution by subdividing it into overlapping chunks and learning their conditional relationships through a single bidirectional diffusion model. This allows information to propagate between segments during generation, ensuring physically consistent connections. We conduct experiments on benchmark tasks of various difficulties, covering different environment sizes, agent state dimension, trajectory types, training data quality, and show that CompDiffuser significantly outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Evaluation methods for autonomous driving are crucial for algorithm optimization. However, due to the complexity of driving intelligence, there is currently no comprehensive evaluation method for the level of autonomous driving intelligence. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework for driving behavior intelligence in complex traffic environments, aiming to fill this gap. We constructed a natural language evaluation dataset of human professional drivers and passengers through naturalistic driving experiments and post-driving behavior evaluation interviews. Based on this dataset, we developed an LLM-powered driving evaluation framework. The effectiveness of this framework was validated through simulated experiments in the CARLA urban traffic simulator and further corroborated by human assessment. Our research provides valuable insights for evaluating and designing more intelligent, human-like autonomous driving agents. The implementation details of the framework and detailed information about the dataset can be found at Github.

总结:
本文介绍了针对Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN)的专用大型语言模型（LLMs）项目ORANSight-2.0。ORANSight-2.0旨在开发专门针对O-RAN的奠基性LLMs，使用了涵盖五个开源LLM框架的18个模型进行微调。其核心技术RANSTRUCT是一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的指令微调框架，通过两个LLM代理创建高质量的指令数据集，再利用QLoRA对预训练的开源LLMs进行微调。为了评估ORANSight-2.0，文中提出了针对srsRAN这一广泛应用的5G O-RAN栈的代码生成和理解新基准srsRANBench，并结合现有ORANBench13K基准进行了测试。结果显示，ORANSight-2.0模型在ORANBench和srsRANBench上的性能分别比ChatGPT-4o和Gemini等通用及封闭源码模型高出5.421%和18.465%，同时保持较低的计算和能源成本。此外，还研究了RAG增强型ORANSight-2.0 LLMs的能效特性，分析了它们在训练、标准推理以及RAG增强推理阶段的能量消耗。 <div>

Abstract: Despite the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) across critical domains such as healthcare, customer service, and business marketing, their integration into Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) remains limited. This gap is primarily due to the absence of domain-specific foundational models, with existing solutions often relying on general-purpose LLMs that fail to address the unique challenges and technical intricacies of O-RAN. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative aimed at developing specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN. Built on 18 LLMs spanning five open-source LLM frameworks, ORANSight-2.0 fine-tunes models ranging from 1 to 70B parameters, significantly reducing reliance on proprietary, closed-source models while enhancing performance for O-RAN. At the core of ORANSight-2.0 is RANSTRUCT, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based instruction-tuning framework that employs two LLM agents to create high-quality instruction-tuning datasets. The generated dataset is then used to fine-tune the 18 pre-trained open-source LLMs via QLoRA. To evaluate ORANSight-2.0, we introduce srsRANBench, a novel benchmark designed for code generation and codebase understanding in the context of srsRAN, a widely used 5G O-RAN stack. We also leverage ORANBench13K, an existing benchmark for assessing O-RAN-specific knowledge. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ORANSight-2.0 models outperform general-purpose and closed-source models, such as ChatGPT-4o and Gemini, by 5.421% on ORANBench and 18.465% on srsRANBench, achieving superior performance while maintaining lower computational and energy costs. We also experiment with RAG-augmented variants of ORANSight-2.0 LLMs and thoroughly evaluate their energy characteristics, demonstrating costs for training, standard inference, and RAG-augmented inference.

本文关注深度强化学习（RL）代理在实际部署中的可靠性问题，指出训练环境可能无法完全反映真实环境。为解决RL中异常检测（OOD）的问题，文章基于马尔可夫决策过程的视角，定义了OOD执行：即在实际部署中出现的概率与训练过程中遇到的转移分布不同的状态转移被视为OOD。为此，文中利用条件变分自编码器（CVAE）来近似训练环境的转移动态，并实现了一个基于重构损失的符合性检测器，该检测器能够在预设置信水平下保证OOD检测。最后，通过改编现有基准对提出的检测器进行了评估并与现有的RL OOD检测模型进行了比较。 <div>

Abstract: An issue concerning the use of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents is whether they can be trusted to perform reliably when deployed, as training environments may not reflect real-life environments. Anticipating instances outside their training scope, learning-enabled systems are often equipped with out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors that alert when a trained system encounters a state it does not recognize or in which it exhibits uncertainty. There exists limited work conducted on the problem of OOD detection within RL, with prior studies being unable to achieve a consensus on the definition of OOD execution within the context of RL. By framing our problem using a Markov Decision Process, we assume there is a transition distribution mapping each state-action pair to another state with some probability. Based on this, we consider the following definition of OOD execution within RL: A transition is OOD if its probability during real-life deployment differs from the transition distribution encountered during training. As such, we utilize conditional variational autoencoders (CVAE) to approximate the transition dynamics of the training environment and implement a conformity-based detector using reconstruction loss that is able to guarantee OOD detection with a pre-determined confidence level. We evaluate our detector by adapting existing benchmarks and compare it with existing OOD detection models for RL.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) has accelerated AI-native applications, such as AI-based storybooks that automate engaging story production for children. However, challenges remain in improving story attractiveness, enriching storytelling expressiveness, and developing open-source evaluation benchmarks and frameworks. Therefore, we propose and opensource MM-StoryAgent, which creates immersive narrated video storybooks with refined plots, role-consistent images, and multi-channel audio. MM-StoryAgent designs a multi-agent framework that employs LLMs and diverse expert tools (generative models and APIs) across several modalities to produce expressive storytelling videos. The framework enhances story attractiveness through a multi-stage writing pipeline. In addition, it improves the immersive storytelling experience by integrating sound effects with visual, music and narrative assets. MM-StoryAgent offers a flexible, open-source platform for further development, where generative modules can be substituted. Both objective and subjective evaluation regarding textual story quality and alignment between modalities validate the effectiveness of our proposed MM-StoryAgent system.

arXiv:2503.05246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is essential for developing agents that can learn, adapt, and accumulate knowledge over time. However, a fundamental challenge persists as agents must strike a delicate balance between plasticity, which enables rapid skill acquisition, and stability, which ensures long-term knowledge retention while preventing catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we introduce SSDE, a novel structure-based approach that enhances plasticity through a fine-grained allocation strategy with Structured Sparsity and Dormant-guided Exploration. SSDE decomposes the parameter space into forward-transfer (frozen) parameters and task-specific (trainable) parameters. Crucially, these parameters are allocated by an efficient co-allocation scheme under sparse coding, ensuring sufficient trainable capacity for new tasks while promoting efficient forward transfer through frozen parameters. However, structure-based methods often suffer from rigidity due to the accumulation of non-trainable parameters, limiting exploration and adaptability. To address this, we further introduce a sensitivity-guided neuron reactivation mechanism that systematically identifies and resets dormant neurons, which exhibit minimal influence in the sparse policy network during inference. This approach effectively enhance exploration while preserving structural efficiency. Extensive experiments on the CW10-v1 Continual World benchmark demonstrate that SSDE achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching a success rate of 95%, surpassing prior methods significantly in both plasticity and stability trade-offs (code is available at: https://github.com/chengqiArchy/SSDE).

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, yet uncertainty in agent behavior and perception noise makes it inherently challenging. While multi-modal trajectory prediction models generate multiple plausible future paths with associated probabilities, effectively quantifying uncertainty remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a novel multi-modal trajectory prediction approach based on evidential deep learning that estimates both positional and mode probability uncertainty in real time. Our approach leverages a Normal Inverse Gamma distribution for positional uncertainty and a Dirichlet distribution for mode uncertainty. Unlike sampling-based methods, it infers both types of uncertainty in a single forward pass, significantly improving efficiency. Additionally, we experimented with uncertainty-driven importance sampling to improve training efficiency by prioritizing underrepresented high-uncertainty samples over redundant ones. We perform extensive evaluations of our method on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets, demonstrating that it provides reliable uncertainty estimates while maintaining high trajectory prediction accuracy.

Abstract: In intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT), blood residues and gas bubbles cause attenuation artifacts that can obscure critical vessel structures. The presence and severity of these artifacts may warrant re-acquisition, prolonging procedure time and increasing use of contrast agent. Accurate detection of these artifacts can guide targeted re-acquisition, reducing the amount of repeated scans needed to achieve diagnostically viable images. However, the highly heterogeneous appearance of these artifacts poses a challenge for the automated detection of the affected image regions. To enable automatic detection of the attenuation artifacts caused by blood residues and gas bubbles based on their severity, we propose a convolutional neural network that performs classification of the attenuation lines (A-lines) into three classes: no artifact, mild artifact and severe artifact. Our model extracts and merges features from OCT images in both Cartesian and polar coordinates, where each column of the image represents an A-line. Our method detects the presence of attenuation artifacts in OCT frames reaching F-scores of 0.77 and 0.94 for mild and severe artifacts, respectively. The inference time over a full OCT scan is approximately 6 seconds. Our experiments show that analysis of images represented in both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems outperforms the analysis in polar coordinates only, suggesting that these representations contain complementary features. This work lays the foundation for automated artifact assessment and image acquisition guidance in intracoronary OCT imaging.

<div> 关键词: 自动医疗报告生成、评价指标、GEMA-Score、多代理评分系统、临床评估

总结:
本文提出了一个名为GEMA-Score的新颖评价体系，用于更全面地评估自动医疗报告生成的可靠性。现有的评价方法主要关注关键医学信息的准确性，而忽略了异常位置和确定性的细节。为解决这一问题，GEMA-Score通过一个基于大型语言模型的多代理工作流程进行客观量化和主观评价。该体系能解析结构化报告，利用命名实体识别F1分数来评估疾病诊断、位置、严重程度及不确定性。同时，一个基于LLM的评分代理则负责评价报告的完整性、可读性和临床术语使用，并提供解释性反馈。实验结果显示，GEMA-Score在公共数据集上与人类专家评估的相关性最高（Rexval数据集上的肯德尔系数为0.70，RadEvalX数据集上的肯德尔系数为0.54）。该项目的匿名演示Demo可在GitHub地址https://github.com/Zhenxuan-Zhang/GEMA_score访问。 <div>

Abstract: Automatic medical report generation supports clinical diagnosis, reduces the workload of radiologists, and holds the promise of improving diagnosis consistency. However, existing evaluation metrics primarily assess the accuracy of key medical information coverage in generated reports compared to human-written reports, while overlooking crucial details such as the location and certainty of reported abnormalities. These limitations hinder the comprehensive assessment of the reliability of generated reports and pose risks in their selection for clinical use. Therefore, we propose a Granular Explainable Multi-Agent Score (GEMA-Score) in this paper, which conducts both objective quantification and subjective evaluation through a large language model-based multi-agent workflow. Our GEMA-Score parses structured reports and employs NER-F1 calculations through interactive exchanges of information among agents to assess disease diagnosis, location, severity, and uncertainty. Additionally, an LLM-based scoring agent evaluates completeness, readability, and clinical terminology while providing explanatory feedback. Extensive experiments validate that GEMA-Score achieves the highest correlation with human expert evaluations on a public dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in clinical scoring (Kendall coefficient = 0.70 for Rexval dataset and Kendall coefficient = 0.54 for RadEvalX dataset).

<div> 关键词：VLM-Attention、多模态、StarCraft II环境、人工agent、人类游戏体验

总结:
本文介绍了VLM-Attention，这是一个针对StarCraft II设计的多模态环境，它使人工智能代理的感知与人类游戏体验相一致。该环境通过引入RGB视觉输入和自然语言观察来克服传统框架（如SMAC）中抽象状态表示与人类感知显著偏离的问题，从而更好地模拟游戏中人类的认知过程。VLM-Attention框架包括三个组成部分：(1)采用专门自我注意力机制以实现战略单位定位和战场评估的视觉-语言模型；(2)利用领域特定的StarCraft II知识指导战术决策的检索增强生成系统；(3)动态的角色任务分配系统，支持协调的多智能体行为。实验结果显示，基于VLM（特别是Qwen-VL和GPT-4o）的代理能够在无需显式训练的情况下执行复杂的战术动作，并在21个定制场景中的表现可与需要大量训练迭代的传统MARL方法媲美。这项工作为开发与人类行为相一致的StarCraft II代理奠定了基础，并推动了多模态游戏AI领域的研究进展。相关的代码实现已发布于https://github.com/camel-ai/VLM-Play-StarCraft2。 <div>
arXiv:2503.05383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce VLM-Attention, a multimodal StarCraft II environment that aligns artificial agent perception with the human gameplay experience. Traditional frameworks such as SMAC rely on abstract state representations that diverge significantly from human perception, limiting the ecological validity of agent behavior. Our environment addresses this limitation by incorporating RGB visual inputs and natural language observations that more closely simulate human cognitive processes during gameplay. The VLM-Attention framework consists of three integrated components: (1) a vision-language model enhanced with specialized self-attention mechanisms for strategic unit targeting and battlefield assessment, (2) a retrieval-augmented generation system that leverages domain-specific StarCraft II knowledge to inform tactical decisions, and (3) a dynamic role-based task distribution system that enables coordinated multi-agent behavior. Our experimental evaluation across 21 custom scenarios demonstrates that VLM-based agents powered by foundation models (specifically Qwen-VL and GPT-4o) can execute complex tactical maneuvers without explicit training, achieving comparable performance to traditional MARL methods that require substantial training iterations. This work establishes a foundation for developing human-aligned StarCraft II agents and advances the broader research agenda of multimodal game AI. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/camel-ai/VLM-Play-StarCraft2.

Abstract: This paper presents an optimization framework for Formula 1 racing that integrates multi-agent interactions, aerodynamic wake effects, trajectory optimization, and energy management. By employing game-theoretic methods, we formulate the minimum lap time problem as either a Nash or a Stackelberg game. Exploiting their structural similarities, we compare symmetric and hierarchical strategies to analyze competitive racing dynamics and strategic dominance. Additionally, we introduce an algorithm to refine local Stackelberg solutions. Our findings underscore the importance of jointly optimizing physical interactions, energy management, and trajectory, highlighting their strong interdependence. We examine the impact of slipstreaming on trajectory selection in corners, straights, and high-speed sections, while also identifying optimal overtaking locations based on energy allocation strategies. By incorporating a physically accurate interaction model and accounting for the optimal responses of competing agents, our approach reveals characteristic strategic behaviors observed in real-world racing. The proposed methodology contributes towards realistic Formula 1 race strategy optimizations, with potential applications in motorsport engineering and autonomous racing.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems address issues of accessibility and scalability of artificial intelligence (AI) foundation models, which are often represented by large language models. We develop a framework - the "Society of HiveMind" (SOHM) - that orchestrates the interaction between multiple AI foundation models, imitating the observed behavior of animal swarms in nature by following modern evolutionary theories. On the one hand, we find that the SOHM provides a negligible benefit on tasks that mainly require real-world knowledge. On the other hand, we remark a significant improvement on tasks that require intensive logical reasoning, indicating that multi-agent systems are capable of increasing the reasoning capabilities of the collective compared to the individual agents. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining a multitude of diverse AI foundation models to form an artificial swarm intelligence capable of self-improvement through interactions with a given environment.

arXiv:2503.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As image-based deep reinforcement learning tackles more challenging tasks, increasing model size has become an important factor in improving performance. Recent studies achieved this by focusing on the parameter efficiency of scaled networks, typically using Impala-CNN, a 15-layer ResNet-inspired network, as the image encoder. However, while Impala-CNN evidently outperforms older CNN architectures, potential advancements in network design for deep reinforcement learning-specific image encoders remain largely unexplored. We find that replacing the flattening of output feature maps in Impala-CNN with global average pooling leads to a notable performance improvement. This approach outperforms larger and more complex models in the Procgen Benchmark, particularly in terms of generalization. We call our proposed encoder model Impoola-CNN. A decrease in the network's translation sensitivity may be central to this improvement, as we observe the most significant gains in games without agent-centered observations. Our results demonstrate that network scaling is not just about increasing model size - efficient network design is also an essential factor.

<div> 关键词：强化学习、分布式强化学习、连续时间强化学习、分布哈密顿-雅可比-贝尔曼方程、近似解

总结:
本文探讨了强化学习中的长期决策行为评估，特别是关注于分布式强化学习（Distributional Reinforcement Learning, DRL）及其对策略评价的丰富统计信息。对于无法自然划分为离散时间增量的情况，研究者转向了连续时间强化学习（Continuous-Time Reinforcement Learning, CTRL），其中代理状态和决策连续演变。尽管在CTRL中已知哈密顿-雅可比-贝尔曼（Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman, HJB）方程可以刻画期望回报，但关于CTRL下的分布式RL尚处于初级阶段。最近的工作已经建立了分布式的HJB（DHJB）方程，首次为CTRL中的回报分布提供了理论基础。然而，DHJB方程的精确求解与表示极具挑战性，需要创新的近似方法。为此，本文朝着这一目标迈进，提出了在参数化回报分布的方法满足一定拓扑性质条件下，能够近似求解DHJB方程的条件。具体来说，文章证明了分布式RL中常见的分位数表示法满足该拓扑性质，从而认证了一种用于连续时间分布式强化学习的有效近似算法。 <div>

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), the long-term behavior of decision-making policies is evaluated based on their average returns. Distributional RL has emerged, presenting techniques for learning return distributions, which provide additional statistics for evaluating policies, incorporating risk-sensitive considerations. When the passage of time cannot naturally be divided into discrete time increments, researchers have studied the continuous-time RL (CTRL) problem, where agent states and decisions evolve continuously. In this setting, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is well established as the characterization of the expected return, and many solution methods exist. However, the study of distributional RL in the continuous-time setting is in its infancy. Recent work has established a distributional HJB (DHJB) equation, providing the first characterization of return distributions in CTRL. These equations and their solutions are intractable to solve and represent exactly, requiring novel approximation techniques. This work takes strides towards this end, establishing conditions on the method of parameterizing return distributions under which the DHJB equation can be approximately solved. Particularly, we show that under a certain topological property of the mapping between statistics learned by a distributional RL algorithm and corresponding distributions, approximation of these statistics leads to close approximations of the solution of the DHJB equation. Concretely, we demonstrate that the quantile representation common in distributional RL satisfies this topological property, certifying an efficient approximation algorithm for continuous-time distributional RL.

Abstract: Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for autonomous driving, where data efficiency and robustness are critical. Yet, existing solutions often rely on carefully crafted, task specific extrinsic rewards, limiting generalization to new tasks or environments. In this paper, we propose InDRiVE (Intrinsic Disagreement based Reinforcement for Vehicle Exploration), a method that leverages purely intrinsic, disagreement based rewards within a Dreamer based MBRL framework. By training an ensemble of world models, the agent actively explores high uncertainty regions of environments without any task specific feedback. This approach yields a task agnostic latent representation, allowing for rapid zero shot or few shot fine tuning on downstream driving tasks such as lane following and collision avoidance. Experimental results in both seen and unseen environments demonstrate that InDRiVE achieves higher success rates and fewer infractions compared to DreamerV2 and DreamerV3 baselines despite using significantly fewer training steps. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of purely intrinsic exploration for learning robust vehicle control behaviors, paving the way for more scalable and adaptable autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Animals achieve sophisticated behavioral control through dynamic coupling of the brain, body, and environment. Accordingly, the co-design approach, in which both the controllers and the physical properties are optimized simultaneously, has been suggested for generating refined agents without designing each component separately. In this study, we aim to reveal how the function of the information processing is distributed between brains and bodies while applying the co-design approach. Using a framework called ``backpropagation through soft body," we developed agents to perform specified tasks and analyzed their mechanisms. The tasks included classification and corresponding behavioral association, nonlinear dynamical system emulation, and autonomous behavioral generation. In each case, our analyses revealed reciprocal relationships between the brains and bodies. In addition, we show that optimized brain functionalities can be embedded into bodies using physical reservoir computing techniques. Our results pave the way for efficient designs of brain--body coupling systems.

Abstract: Combining existing pre-trained expert LLMs is a promising avenue for scalably tackling large-scale and diverse tasks. However, selecting experts at the task level is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that Symbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.

Abstract: Information technology has profoundly altered the way humans interact with information. The vast amount of content created, shared, and disseminated online has made it increasingly difficult to access relevant information. Over the past two decades, search and recommendation systems (collectively referred to as information retrieval systems) have evolved significantly to address these challenges. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities that surpass human performance in various language-related tasks and exhibit general understanding, reasoning, and decision-making abilities. This paper explores the transformative potential of large language model agents in enhancing search and recommendation systems. We discuss the motivations and roles of LLM agents, and establish a classification framework to elaborate on the existing research. We highlight the immense potential of LLM agents in addressing current challenges in search and recommendation, providing insights into future research directions. This paper is the first to systematically review and classify the research on LLM agents in these domains, offering a novel perspective on leveraging this advanced AI technology for information retrieval. To help understand the existing works, we list the existing papers on agent-based simulation with large language models at this link: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/LLM-Agent-for-Recommendation-and-Search.

总结:
本文研究了具有通用、非单调估值的个体之间不可分割物品的公平分配问题。文章探讨了满足公平或平等约束的分配存在的条件及其有效计算方法。文中考虑的公平性概念保证每个个体对其所获物品的价值至少与其他个体相当，并允许对物品进行增减调整。对于将物品分类为商品或苦差事的情况，提出了一个伪多项式时间的局部搜索算法，用于计算“等价于任意商品或任意苦差事的均衡”（EQX*）分配。此外，还给出了一种能实现“等价于一件物品的均衡”（EQ1）分配的多项式时间贪婪算法，以及针对加性估值时返回EQX*分配的类似算法。本文的关键技术贡献在于利用固定点定理（如斯普纳引理及其变体），证明了对于非负（甚至可能非客观和非单调的）估值，存在“等价于一件商品和一件苦差事的均衡”（EQ1*）和“一物品嫉妒自由”（EF1*）分配。即使物品排列在路径上且分配必须形成连通子路径，这一结论仍然成立。此外，还提出了一种计算EQ1*分配的多项式时间动态规划算法。最后，通过使用一种新颖的多颜色版本的斯普纳引理，将EF1*和EQ1*的结果扩展到了非正估值。对于单调递减估值和沿路径相连的包裹，这意味着存在EF1和EQ1分配，其中EQ1分配可以被有效地计算出来。 <div>

Abstract: In this work, we revisit well-studied problems of fair allocation of indivisible items among agents with general, non-monotone valuations. We explore the existence and efficient computation of allocations that satisfy either fairness or equity constraints. The fairness notions we consider ensure that each agent values her bundle at least as much as others', allowing for (any or some) item removal, while the equity guarantees roughly equal valuations among agents, with similar adjustments. For objective valuations where items are classified as either goods or chores, we present a pseudo-polynomial local-search algorithm computing an ``equitable-up-to-any-good-or-any-chore'' (EQX*) allocation, a weaker version of an ``equitable-up-to-any-item" (EQX) allocation. Additionally, we provide a polynomial-time greedy algorithm that computes an ``equitable-up-to-one-item" (EQ1) allocation, and a similar algorithm returning an EQX* allocation when the valuations are also additive. As a key technical contribution of this work, by leveraging fixed-point theorems (such as Sperner's Lemma and its variants), we establish the existence of ``equitable-up-to-one-good-and-one-chore'' (EQ1*) and ``envy-free-up-to-one-good-and-one-chore'' (EF1*) allocations for non-negative (and possibly non-objective and non-monotone) valuations. This holds even when items are arranged in a path and bundles must form connected sub-paths. Additionally, we present a polynomial-time dynamic-programming algorithm that computes an EQ1* allocation. Finally, we extend the EF1* and EQ1* results to non-positive valuations using a novel multi-coloring variant of Sperner's lemma, a combinatorial result of independent interest. For monotone non-increasing valuations and path-connected bundles, this implies the existence of EF1 and EQ1 allocations, with EQ1 allocations being efficiently computable.

本文扩展了Blackwell在1953年关于信息比较的研究，将其应用于一个序贯社会学习模型中。在这个模型中，代理人基于私人信号和他人的观察行动进行决策。文章引入了一个新的二元关系，定义了一个信息结构的社会价值优于另一个，如果它能为所有代理带来更高的期望收益，无论其偏好如何。首先，文章证明了这个二元关系严格强于Blackwell秩序。接着，文章给出了该二元关系的必要且充分条件，并提出一个更易于验证的充分条件。 <div>

Abstract: This study extends Blackwell's (1953) comparison of information to a sequential social learning model, where agents make decisions sequentially based on both private signals and the observed actions of others. In this context, we introduce a new binary relation over information structures: An information structure is more socially valuable than another if it yields higher expected payoffs for all agents, regardless of their preferences. First, we establish that this binary relation is strictly stronger than the Blackwell order. Then, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for our binary relation and propose a simpler sufficient condition that is easier to verify.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities for generating natural text. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can discover diverse solutions to complex real-world problems. Motivated by the common collective and directionality of text generation and evolution, this paper first illustrates the conceptual parallels between LLMs and EAs at a micro level, which includes multiple one-to-one key characteristics: token representation and individual representation, position encoding and fitness shaping, position embedding and selection, Transformers block and reproduction, and model training and parameter adaptation. These parallels highlight potential opportunities for technical advancements in both LLMs and EAs. Subsequently, we analyze existing interdisciplinary research from a macro perspective to uncover critical challenges, with a particular focus on evolutionary fine-tuning and LLM-enhanced EAs. These analyses not only provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms behind LLMs but also offer potential directions for enhancing the capabilities of artificial agents.

总结:
本文研究了涉及追捕者、逃逸者和防御者的三体追逃问题。提出了一种新的合作制导律，确保防御者能在追捕者接近逃逸者前将其拦截。该方法与传统的启发式方法、最优控制、微分游戏形式化以及最近的时间约束制导技术不同，提供了一个几何解法，有效地保护逃逸者免受追捕者的威胁。该策略具有良好的计算效率并有望随着 agent 数量增加而保持可扩展性。重要的是，逃逸者-防御者团队不需要知道追捕者的策略，并且能从任意初始交战构型中保证拦截追捕者。此外，证明了逃逸者-防御者团队所需的关键误差变量将在预设的三体交战时间之前消失。最后，通过模拟多种交战场景验证了所提合作防御策略的有效性。<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses the pursuit-evasion problem involving three agents -- a purser, an evader, and a defender. We develop cooperative guidance laws for the evader-defender team that guarantee that the defender intercepts the pursuer before it reaches the vicinity of the evader. Unlike heuristic methods, optimal control, differential game formulation, and recently proposed time-constrained guidance techniques, we propose a geometric solution to safeguard the evader from the pursuer's incoming threat. The proposed strategy is computationally efficient and expected to be scalable as the number of agents increases. Another alluring feature of the proposed strategy is that the evader-defender team does not require the knowledge of the pursuer's strategy and that the pursuer's interception is guaranteed from arbitrary initial engagement geometries. We further show that the necessary error variables for the evader-defender team vanish within a time that can be exactly prescribed prior to the three-body engagement. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed cooperative defense strategy via simulation in diverse engagement scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-agent robotic exploration stands to play an important role in space exploration as the next generation of robotic systems ventures to far-flung environments. A key challenge in this new paradigm will be to effectively share and utilize the vast amount of data generated onboard while operating in bandwidth-constrained regimes typical of space missions. Federated learning (FL) is a promising tool for bridging this gap. Drawing inspiration from the upcoming CADRE Lunar rover mission, we propose a federated multi-agent mapping approach that jointly trains a global map model across agents without transmitting raw data. Our method leverages implicit neural mapping to generate parsimonious, adaptable representations, reducing data transmission by up to 93.8% compared to raw maps. Furthermore, we enhance this approach with meta-initialization on Earth-based traversability datasets to significantly accelerate map convergence; reducing iterations required to reach target performance by 80% compared to random initialization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on Martian terrains and glacier datasets, achieving downstream path planning F1 scores as high as 0.95 while outperforming on map reconstruction losses.

Abstract: The field of emergent language represents a novel area of research within the domain of artificial intelligence, particularly within the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Although the concept of studying language emergence is not new, early approaches were primarily concerned with explaining human language formation, with little consideration given to its potential utility for artificial agents. In contrast, studies based on reinforcement learning aim to develop communicative capabilities in agents that are comparable to or even superior to human language. Thus, they extend beyond the learned statistical representations that are common in natural language processing research. This gives rise to a number of fundamental questions, from the prerequisites for language emergence to the criteria for measuring its success. This paper addresses these questions by providing a comprehensive review of 181 scientific publications on emergent language in artificial intelligence. Its objective is to serve as a reference for researchers interested in or proficient in the field. Consequently, the main contributions are the definition and overview of the prevailing terminology, the analysis of existing evaluation methods and metrics, and the description of the identified research gaps.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have improved controllable streetscape generation and supported downstream perception and planning tasks. However, challenges remain in accurately modeling driving scenes and generating long videos. To alleviate these issues, we propose DreamForge, an advanced diffusion-based autoregressive video generation model tailored for 3D-controllable long-term generation. To enhance the lane and foreground generation, we introduce perspective guidance and integrate object-wise position encoding to incorporate local 3D correlation and improve foreground object modeling. We also propose motion-aware temporal attention to capture motion cues and appearance changes in videos. By leveraging motion frames and an autoregressive generation paradigm,we can autoregressively generate long videos (over 200 frames) using a model trained in short sequences, achieving superior quality compared to the baseline in 16-frame video evaluations. Finally, we integrate our method with the realistic simulator DriveArena to provide more reliable open-loop and closed-loop evaluations for vision-based driving agents.

Abstract: Peg-in-hole assembly in unknown environments is a challenging task due to onboard sensor errors, which result in uncertainty and variations in task parameters such as the hole position and orientation. Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta RL) has been proposed to mitigate this problem as it learns how to quickly adapt to new tasks with different parameters. However, previous approaches either depend on a sample-inefficient procedure or human demonstrations to perform the task in the real world. Our work modifies the data used by the Meta RL agent and uses simple features that can be easily measured in the real world even with an uncalibrated camera. We further adapt the Meta RL agent to use data from a force/torque sensor, instead of the camera, to perform the assembly, using a small amount of training data. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning method that consistently and safely adapts to out-of-distribution tasks with parameters that differ by a factor of 10 from the training tasks. Our results demonstrate that the proposed data modification significantly enhances the training and adaptation efficiency and enables the agent to achieve 100% success in tasks with different hole positions and orientations. Experiments on a real robot confirm that both camera- and force/torque sensor-equipped agents achieve 100% success in tasks with unknown hole positions, matching their simulation performance and validating the approach's robustness and applicability. Compared to the previous work with sample-inefficient adaptation, our proposed methods are 10 times more sample-efficient in the real-world tasks.

Abstract: We address the challenge of safe control in decentralized multi-agent robotic settings, where agents use uncertain black-box models to predict other agents' trajectories. We use the recently proposed conformal decision theory to adapt the restrictiveness of control barrier functions-based safety constraints based on observed prediction errors. We use these constraints to synthesize controllers that balance between the objectives of safety and task accomplishment, despite the prediction errors. We provide an upper bound on the average over time of the value of a monotonic function of the difference between the safety constraint based on the predicted trajectories and the constraint based on the ground truth ones. We validate our theory through experimental results showing the performance of our controllers when navigating a robot in the multi-agent scenes in the Stanford Drone Dataset.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction models in autonomous driving are vulnerable to perturbations from non-causal agents whose actions should not affect the ego-agent's behavior. Such perturbations can lead to incorrect predictions of other agents' trajectories, potentially compromising the safety and efficiency of the ego-vehicle's decision-making process. Motivated by this challenge, we propose $\textit{Causal tRajecTory predICtion}$ $\textbf{(CRiTIC)}$, a novel model that utilizes a $\textit{Causal Discovery Network}$ to identify inter-agent causal relations over a window of past time steps. To incorporate discovered causal relationships, we propose a novel $\textit{Causal Attention Gating}$ mechanism to selectively filter information in the proposed Transformer-based architecture. We conduct extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmark datasets to evaluate the robustness of our model against non-causal perturbations and its generalization capacity. Our results indicate that the robustness of predictions can be improved by up to $\textbf{54%}$ without a significant detriment to prediction accuracy. Lastly, we demonstrate the superior domain generalizability of the proposed model, which achieves up to $\textbf{29%}$ improvement in cross-domain performance. These results underscore the potential of our model to enhance both robustness and generalization capacity for trajectory prediction in diverse autonomous driving domains.

Abstract: This study presents a transformer-based approach for fault-tolerant control in fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), designed to adapt in real time to dynamic changes caused by structural damage or actuator failures. Unlike traditional Flight Control Systems (FCSs) that rely on classical control theory and struggle under severe alterations in dynamics, our method directly maps outer-loop reference values -- altitude, heading, and airspeed -- into control commands using the in-context learning and attention mechanisms of transformers, thus bypassing inner-loop controllers and fault-detection layers. Employing a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework, the proposed approach trains a student agent with partial observations by transferring knowledge from a privileged expert agent with full observability, enabling robust performance across diverse failure scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our transformer-based controller outperforms industry-standard FCS and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods, maintaining high tracking accuracy and stability in nominal conditions and extreme failure cases, highlighting its potential for enhancing UAV operational safety and reliability.

Abstract: Robot decision-making in partially observable, real-time, dynamic, and multi-agent environments remains a difficult and unsolved challenge. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to learning decision-making in such domains, however, end-to-end RL in complex environments is often intractable. To address this challenge in the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL) domain, we developed a novel architecture integrating RL within a classical robotics stack, while employing a multi-fidelity sim2real approach and decomposing behavior into learned sub-behaviors with heuristic selection. Our architecture led to victory in the 2024 RoboCup SPL Challenge Shield Division. In this work, we fully describe our system's architecture and empirically analyze key design decisions that contributed to its success. Our approach demonstrates how RL-based behaviors can be integrated into complete robot behavior architectures.

Abstract: We present Wasserstein Adaptive Value Estimation for Actor-Critic (WAVE), an approach to enhance stability in deep reinforcement learning through adaptive Wasserstein regularization. Our method addresses the inherent instability of actor-critic algorithms by incorporating an adaptively weighted Wasserstein regularization term into the critic's loss function. We prove that WAVE achieves $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$ convergence rate for the critic's mean squared error and provide theoretical guarantees for stability through Wasserstein-based regularization. Using the Sinkhorn approximation for computational efficiency, our approach automatically adjusts the regularization based on the agent's performance. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that WAVE achieves superior performance compared to standard actor-critic methods.

Abstract: Web browsing agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown tremendous potential in automating complex web-based tasks. Existing approaches typically rely on large LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) to explore web environments and generate trajectory data, which is then used either for demonstration retrieval (for large LLMs) or to distill small LLMs (e.g., Llama3) in a process that remains decoupled from the exploration. In this paper, we propose AgentSymbiotic, an iterative framework that couples data synthesis with task-performance, yielding a "symbiotic improvement" for both large and small LLMs. Our study uncovers a complementary dynamic between LLM types: while large LLMs excel at generating high-quality trajectories for distillation, the distilled small LLMs-owing to their distinct reasoning capabilities-often choose actions that diverge from those of their larger counterparts. This divergence drives the exploration of novel trajectories, thereby enriching the synthesized data. However, we also observe that the performance of small LLMs becomes a bottleneck in this iterative enhancement process. To address this, we propose two innovations in LLM distillation: a speculative data synthesis strategy that mitigates off-policy bias, and a multi-task learning approach designed to boost the reasoning capabilities of the student LLM. Furthermore, we introduce a Hybrid Mode for Privacy Preservation to address user privacy concerns. Evaluated on the WEBARENA benchmark, AgentSymbiotic achieves SOTA performance with both LLM types. Our best Large LLM agent reaches 52%, surpassing the previous best of 45%, while our 8B distilled model demonstrates a competitive 49%, exceeding the prior best of 28%. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Autonomous racing has gained significant attention as a platform for high-speed decision-making and motion control. While existing methods primarily focus on trajectory planning and overtaking strategies, the role of sportsmanship in ensuring fair competition remains largely unexplored. In human racing, rules such as the one-motion rule and the enough-space rule prevent dangerous and unsportsmanlike behavior. However, autonomous racing systems often lack mechanisms to enforce these principles, potentially leading to unsafe maneuvers. This paper introduces a bi-level game-theoretic framework to integrate sportsmanship (SPS) into versus racing. At the high level, we model racing intentions using a Stackelberg game, where Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is employed to derive optimal strategies. At the low level, vehicle interactions are formulated as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP), ensuring that all agents follow sportsmanship constraints while optimizing their trajectories. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enforcing sportsmanship rules while maintaining competitive performance. We analyze different scenarios where attackers and defenders adhere to or disregard sportsmanship rules and show how knowledge of these constraints influences strategic decision-making. This work highlights the importance of balancing competition and fairness in autonomous racing and provides a foundation for developing ethical and safe AI-driven racing systems.

<div> 关键词：Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)，Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS)，Explicit Estimation CBS (EECBS)，double-ECBS (DECBS)，碰撞避免

总结:
本文提出了一种针对多智能体路径规划问题（MAPF）的新算法——双增强冲突搜索（DECBS），该问题是NP难的问题。DECBS旨在解决传统聚焦搜索方法中，如ECBS和EECBS，早期搜索阶段较低下界值导致的有效搜索空间受限的问题。DECBS首先确定最大下界值，然后采用基于此下界的最好优先搜索来寻找无冲突路径。实验结果显示，DECBS在大多数测试案例中优于ECBS，并能与现有优化技术兼容。DECBS可以减少约30%的高层CT节点和50%的低层聚焦搜索节点。在中等到高密度的智能体场景下，DECBS相比ECBS在相同次优性约束和优化条件下，平均运行时间提高了23.5%。 <div>

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) involves finding collision-free paths for multiple agents while minimizing a cost function--an NP-hard problem. Bounded suboptimal methods like Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS) and Explicit Estimation CBS (EECBS) balance solution quality with computational efficiency using focal search mechanisms. While effective, traditional focal search faces a limitation: the lower bound (LB) value determining which nodes enter the FOCAL list often increases slowly in early search stages, resulting in a constrained search space that delays finding valid solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel bounded suboptimal algorithm, double-ECBS (DECBS), to address this issue by first determining the maximum LB value and then employing a best-first search guided by this LB to find a collision-free path. Experimental results demonstrate that DECBS outperforms ECBS in most test cases and is compatible with existing optimization techniques. DECBS can reduce nearly 30% high-level CT nodes and 50% low-level focal search nodes. When agent density is moderate to high, DECBS achieves a 23.5% average runtime improvement over ECBS with identical suboptimality bounds and optimizations.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in solving complex problems involving cooperation and competition among agents, such as an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) swarm used in search and rescue, surveillance, and vessel protection. However, aligning system behavior with user preferences is challenging due to the difficulty of encoding expert intuition into reward functions. To address the issue, we propose a Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) approach for MARL that resolves credit-assignment challenges through an Agent-Level Feedback system categorizing feedback into intra-agent, inter-agent, and intra-team types. To overcome the challenges of direct human feedback, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) evaluator to validate our approach using feedback scenarios such as region constraints, collision avoidance, and task allocation. Our method effectively refines USV swarm policies, addressing key challenges in multi-agent systems while maintaining fairness and performance consistency.

Abstract: This work examines the integration of large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent simulations by replacing the hard-coded programs of agents with LLM-driven prompts. The proposed approach is showcased in the context of two examples of complex systems from the field of swarm intelligence: ant colony foraging and bird flocking. Central to this study is a toolchain that integrates LLMs with the NetLogo simulation platform, leveraging its Python extension to enable communication with GPT-4o via the OpenAI API. This toolchain facilitates prompt-driven behavior generation, allowing agents to respond adaptively to environmental data. For both example applications mentioned above, we employ both structured, rule-based prompts and autonomous, knowledge-driven prompts. Our work demonstrates how this toolchain enables LLMs to study self-organizing processes and induce emergent behaviors within multi-agent environments, paving the way for new approaches to exploring intelligent systems and modeling swarm intelligence inspired by natural phenomena.

Abstract: The partial alignment and conflict of autonomous agents lead to mixed-motive scenarios in many real-world applications. However, agents may fail to cooperate in practice even when cooperation yields a better outcome. One well known reason for this failure comes from non-credible commitments. To facilitate commitments among agents for better cooperation, we define Markov Commitment Games (MCGs), a variant of commitment games, where agents can voluntarily commit to their proposed future plans. Based on MCGs, we propose a learnable commitment protocol via policy gradients. We further propose incentive-compatible learning to accelerate convergence to equilibria with better social welfare. Experimental results in challenging mixed-motive tasks demonstrate faster empirical convergence and higher returns for our method compared with its counterparts. Our code is available at https://github.com/shuhui-zhu/DCL.

Abstract: Most offline RL algorithms return optimal policies but do not provide statistical guarantees on undesirable behaviors. This could generate reliability issues in safety-critical applications, such as in some multiagent domains where agents, and possibly humans, need to interact to reach their goals without harming each other. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL approach, inspired by Seldonian optimization, which returns policies with good performance and statistically guaranteed properties with respect to predefined undesirable behaviors. In particular, our focus is on Ad Hoc Teamwork settings, where agents must collaborate with new teammates without prior coordination. Our method requires only a pre-collected dataset, a set of candidate policies for our agent, and a specification about the possible policies followed by the other players -- it does not require further interactions, training, or assumptions on the type and architecture of the policies. We test our algorithm in Ad Hoc Teamwork problems and show that it consistently finds reliable policies while improving sample efficiency with respect to standard ML baselines.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over non-speech sounds and music are crucial for both humans and AI agents to interact effectively with their environments. In this paper, we introduce Audio Flamingo 2 (AF2), an Audio-Language Model (ALM) with advanced audio understanding and reasoning capabilities. AF2 leverages (i) a custom CLAP model, (ii) synthetic Audio QA data for fine-grained audio reasoning, and (iii) a multi-stage curriculum learning strategy. AF2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a 3B parameter small language model, surpassing large open-source and proprietary models across over 20 benchmarks. Next, for the first time, we extend audio understanding to long audio segments (30 secs to 5 mins) and propose LongAudio, a large and novel dataset for training ALMs on long audio captioning and question-answering tasks. Fine-tuning AF2 on LongAudio leads to exceptional performance on our proposed LongAudioBench, an expert annotated benchmark for evaluating ALMs on long audio understanding capabilities. We conduct extensive ablation studies to confirm the efficacy of our approach. Project Website: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/AF2/.

Abstract: We introduce Pok\'eChamp, a minimax agent powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for Pok\'emon battles. Built on a general framework for two-player competitive games, Pok\'eChamp leverages the generalist capabilities of LLMs to enhance minimax tree search. Specifically, LLMs replace three key modules: (1) player action sampling, (2) opponent modeling, and (3) value function estimation, enabling the agent to effectively utilize gameplay history and human knowledge to reduce the search space and address partial observability. Notably, our framework requires no additional LLM training. We evaluate Pok\'eChamp in the popular Gen 9 OU format. When powered by GPT-4o, it achieves a win rate of 76% against the best existing LLM-based bot and 84% against the strongest rule-based bot, demonstrating its superior performance. Even with an open-source 8-billion-parameter Llama 3.1 model, Pok\'eChamp consistently outperforms the previous best LLM-based bot, Pok\'ellmon powered by GPT-4o, with a 64% win rate. Pok\'eChamp attains a projected Elo of 1300-1500 on the Pok\'emon Showdown online ladder, placing it among the top 30%-10% of human players. In addition, this work compiles the largest real-player Pok\'emon battle dataset, featuring over 3 million games, including more than 500k high-Elo matches. Based on this dataset, we establish a series of battle benchmarks and puzzles to evaluate specific battling skills. We further provide key updates to the local game engine. We hope this work fosters further research that leverage Pok\'emon battle as benchmark to integrate LLM technologies with game-theoretic algorithms addressing general multiagent problems.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative visual analytics systems has transformed data-driven insights, yet significant challenges persist in accurately interpreting users' analytical and interaction intents. While language inputs offer flexibility, they often lack precision, making the expression of complex intents inefficient, error-prone, and time-intensive. To address these limitations, we investigate the design space of multimodal interactions for generative visual analytics through a literature review and pilot brainstorming sessions. Building on these insights, we introduce a highly extensible workflow that integrates multiple LLM agents for intent inference and visualization generation. We develop InterChat, a generative visual analytics system that combines direct manipulation of visual elements with natural language inputs. This integration enables precise intent communication and supports progressive, visually driven exploratory data analyses. By employing effective prompt engineering, and contextual interaction linking, alongside intuitive visualization and interaction designs, InterChat bridges the gap between user interactions and LLM-driven visualizations, enhancing both interpretability and usability. Extensive evaluations, including two usage scenarios, a user study, and expert feedback, demonstrate the effectiveness of InterChat. Results show significant improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of handling complex visual analytics tasks, highlighting the potential of multimodal interactions to redefine user engagement and analytical depth in generative visual analytics.

Abstract: Cooperative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (C-SLAM) enables multiple agents to work together in mapping unknown environments while simultaneously estimating their own positions. This approach enhances robustness, scalability, and accuracy by sharing information between agents, reducing drift, and enabling collective exploration of larger areas.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of code largelanguage models underscores the need for effective and transparent benchmarking of their reasoning capabilities. However, the current benchmarking approach heavily depends on publicly available, human-created datasets. The widespread use of these fixed benchmark datasets makes the benchmarking process to be static and thus particularly susceptible to data contamination, an unavoidable consequence of the extensive data collection processes used to train Code LLMs. Existing approaches that address data contamination often suffer from human effort limitations and imbalanced problem complexity. To tackle these challenges, we propose \tool, a novel benchmarking suite for evaluating Code LLMs under potential data contamination. Given a seed programming problem, \tool employs multiple agents to extract and modify the context without altering the core logic, generating semantically equivalent variations. We introduce a dynamic data generation methods and conduct empirical studies on two seed datasets across 21 Code LLMs. Results show that \tool effectively benchmarks reasoning capabilities under contamination risks while generating diverse problem sets to ensure consistent and reliable evaluations.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving medical decision support for kidney disease requires localized deployment of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining clinical reasoning capabilities. Current solutions face three challenges: 1) Cloud-based LLMs pose data security risks; 2) Local model deployment demands technical expertise; 3) General LLMs lack mechanisms to integrate medical knowledge. Retrieval-augmented systems also struggle with medical document processing and clinical usability. We developed KidneyTalk-open, a desktop system integrating three technical components: 1) No-code deployment of state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source LLMs (such as DeepSeek-r1, Qwen2.5) via local inference engine; 2) Medical document processing pipeline combining context-aware chunking and intelligent filtering; 3) Adaptive Retrieval and Augmentation Pipeline (AddRep) employing agents collaboration for improving the recall rate of medical documents. A graphical interface was designed to enable clinicians to manage medical documents and conduct AI-powered consultations without technical expertise. Experimental validation on 1,455 challenging nephrology exam questions demonstrates AddRep's effectiveness: achieving 29.1% accuracy (+8.1% over baseline) with intelligent knowledge integration, while maintaining robustness through 4.9% rejection rate to suppress hallucinations. Comparative case studies with the mainstream products (AnythingLLM, Chatbox, GPT4ALL) demonstrate KidneyTalk-open's superior performance in real clinical query. KidneyTalk-open represents the first no-code medical LLM system enabling secure documentation-enhanced medical Q&amp;A on desktop. Its designs establishes a new framework for privacy-sensitive clinical AI applications. The system significantly lowers technical barriers while improving evidence traceability, enabling more medical staff or patients to use SOTA open-source LLMs conveniently.

Abstract: In intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), incorporating pedestrians and vehicles in-the-loop is crucial for developing realistic and safe traffic management solutions. However, there is falls short of simulating complex real-world ITS scenarios, primarily due to the lack of a digital twin implementation framework for characterizing interactions between pedestrians and vehicles at different locations in different traffic environments. In this article, we propose a surveillance video assisted federated digital twin (SV-FDT) framework to empower ITSs with pedestrians and vehicles in-the-loop. Specifically, SVFDT builds comprehensive pedestrian-vehicle interaction models by leveraging multi-source traffic surveillance videos. Its architecture consists of three layers: (i) the end layer, which collects traffic surveillance videos from multiple sources; (ii) the edge layer, responsible for semantic segmentation-based visual understanding, twin agent-based interaction modeling, and local digital twin system (LDTS) creation in local regions; and (iii) the cloud layer, which integrates LDTSs across different regions to construct a global DT model in realtime. We analyze key design requirements and challenges and present core guidelines for SVFDT's system implementation. A testbed evaluation demonstrates its effectiveness in optimizing traffic management. Comparisons with traditional terminal-server frameworks highlight SV-FDT's advantages in mirroring delays, recognition accuracy, and subjective evaluation. Finally, we identify some open challenges and discuss future research directions.

总结:<br />
该文针对知识积累和更新中的时间进程问题，提出了一种基于工具的离样本测试框架，用于衡量来自不同日期控制工具(DCTs)的大型语言模型(LLM)代理的知识变异性。文章通过实验展示了LLM作为写作助手利用网络搜索帮助完成科学出版物摘要时的时间效应。研究发现，搜索引擎的时间效应会导致工具依赖性的代理性能差异，但这一影响可以通过选择基础模型以及使用如chain-of-thought提示等明确推理指令得到缓解。因此，文章认为应当从动态视角对智能体进行评估，并考虑到工具的时间影响及外部资源的更新情况。 <div>

Abstract: Temporal progression is an integral part of knowledge accumulation and update. Web search is frequently adopted as grounding for agent knowledge, yet its inappropriate configuration affects the quality of agent responses. Here, we construct a tool-based out-of-sample testing framework to measure the knowledge variability of large language model (LLM) agents from distinct date-controlled tools (DCTs). We demonstrate the temporal effects of an LLM agent as a writing assistant, which can use web search to help complete scientific publication abstracts. We show that temporal effects of the search engine translates into tool-dependent agent performance but can be alleviated with base model choice and explicit reasoning instructions such as chain-of-thought prompting. Our results indicate that agent evaluation should take a dynamical view and account for the temporal influence of tools and the updates of external resources.

<div> 关键词：边缘计算、服务质量、弹性伸缩、多维度、自动扩展

总结:
本文提出了一种针对流媒体服务在质量和资源维度上实现层次化扩展的解决方案。该方案着重于解决依赖于持续处理物联网数据以提供实时服务并满足应用目标（服务水平目标——SLOs）的现代场景，如智慧城市。由于倾向于在附近的边缘设备上处理数据，这可能会导致资源瓶颈，因为资源的供应量有限。为了提高边缘环境中的弹性，提议从两个层面进行服务扩展：(1) 本地、服务特定的代理通过多维度弹性策略确保SLO的履行，当无法再分配更多资源时，(2) 更高层次的代理会优化全局SLO履行，通过交换资源来进行调整。实验结果显示了这种方法具有积极的效果，与常规垂直自动扩展器相比，在资源紧张的情况下表现更优。 <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical solution to scale streaming services across quality and resource dimensions. Modern scenarios, like smart cities, heavily rely on the continuous processing of IoT data to provide real-time services and meet application targets (Service Level Objectives -- SLOs). While the tendency is to process data at nearby Edge devices, this creates a bottleneck because resources can only be provisioned up to a limited capacity. To improve elasticity in Edge environments, we propose to scale services in multiple dimensions -- either resources or, alternatively, the service quality. We rely on a two-layer architecture where (1) local, service-specific agents ensure SLO fulfillment through multi-dimensional elasticity strategies; if no more resources can be allocated, (2) a higher-level agent optimizes global SLO fulfillment by swapping resources. The experimental results show promising outcomes, outperforming regular vertical autoscalers, when operating under tight resource constraints.

总结:
本文研究了在线学习算法在多代理环境中的应用，特别是在重复拍卖、合同设计和定价竞争等战略场景下。文章提出了一个重要的计算困难性结果：除非$\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}$，否则不存在一个能在多项式时间内为优化者计算接近最优策略的方法来对抗使用标准无遗憾算法（如Multiplicative Weights Update, MWU）的学习者。这一结果强化了先前的工作，不仅将硬度界限从常数级别的加法不可能性提升到$Ω(T)$级别，而且证明了对于广泛使用的无遗憾学习算法存在困难性，从而在一般博弈论环境中确立了一个基本的计算障碍。 <div>

Abstract: Online learning algorithms are widely used in strategic multi-agent settings, including repeated auctions, contract design, and pricing competitions, where agents adapt their strategies over time. A key question in such environments is how an optimizing agent can best respond to a learning agent to improve its own long-term outcomes. While prior work has developed efficient algorithms for the optimizer in special cases - such as structured auction settings or contract design - no general efficient algorithm is known.
  In this paper, we establish a strong computational hardness result: unless $\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}$, no polynomial-time optimizer can compute a near-optimal strategy against a learner using a standard no-regret algorithm, specifically Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU). Our result proves an $\Omega(T)$ hardness bound, significantly strengthening previous work that only showed an additive $\Theta(1)$ impossibility result. Furthermore, while the prior hardness result focused on learners using fictitious play - an algorithm that is not no-regret - we prove intractability for a widely used no-regret learning algorithm. This establishes a fundamental computational barrier to finding optimal strategies in general game-theoretic settings.

Abstract: The complexity of online decision-making under uncertainty stems from the requirement of finding a balance between exploiting known strategies and exploring new possibilities. Naturally, the uncertainty type plays a crucial role in developing decision-making strategies that manage complexity effectively. In this paper, we focus on a specific form of uncertainty known as epistemic ambivalence (EA), which emerges from conflicting pieces of evidence or contradictory experiences. It creates a delicate interplay between uncertainty and confidence, distinguishing it from epistemic uncertainty that typically diminishes with new information. Indeed, ambivalence can persist even after additional knowledge is acquired. To address this phenomenon, we propose a novel framework, called the epistemically ambivalent Markov decision process (EA-MDP), aiming to understand and control EA in decision-making processes. This framework incorporates the concept of a quantum state from the quantum mechanics formalism, and its core is to assess the probability and reward of every possible outcome. We calculate the reward function using quantum measurement techniques and prove the existence of an optimal policy and an optimal value function in the EA-MDP framework. We also propose the EA-epsilon-greedy Q-learning algorithm. To evaluate the impact of EA on decision-making and the expedience of our framework, we study two distinct experimental setups, namely the two-state problem and the lattice problem. Our results show that using our methods, the agent converges to the optimal policy in the presence of EA.

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种名为DRAGO的新颖方法，用于持续模型驱动的强化学习，旨在改善在具有不同奖励函数但状态空间和动力学保持不变的任务序列中的世界模型递增开发。DRAGO包含两个关键组件：一是使用生成模型创建来自过去任务的合成经验进行复习，使代理能在不存储数据的情况下强化先前学习到的动力学；二是通过引入内在奖励机制“重获记忆探索”，引导代理重新访问先前任务中的相关状态。这两个组件相结合，使得代理能够维持一个全面且不断发展的世界模型，从而更有效地适应和学习多样化的环境。实验评估表明，DRAGO能够在任务之间保存知识，并在各种持续学习场景中展现出优越性能。 <div>

Abstract: We propose DRAGO, a novel approach for continual model-based reinforcement learning aimed at improving the incremental development of world models across a sequence of tasks that differ in their reward functions but not the state space or dynamics. DRAGO comprises two key components: Synthetic Experience Rehearsal, which leverages generative models to create synthetic experiences from past tasks, allowing the agent to reinforce previously learned dynamics without storing data, and Regaining Memories Through Exploration, which introduces an intrinsic reward mechanism to guide the agent toward revisiting relevant states from prior tasks. Together, these components enable the agent to maintain a comprehensive and continually developing world model, facilitating more effective learning and adaptation across diverse environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DRAGO is able to preserve knowledge across tasks, achieving superior performance in various continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have significantly impacted robotics, enabling high-level semantic motion planning applications. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a complementary paradigm, enables agents to autonomously optimize complex behaviors through interaction and reward signals. However, designing effective reward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks where sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate design. In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex HumanInformed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4, a pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language task descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated environments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance feasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria, creating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable text into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive simulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an ABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness. Tasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.

Abstract: Datasets for object detection often do not account for enough variety of glasses, due to their transparent and reflective properties. Specifically, open-vocabulary object detectors, widely used in embodied robotic agents, fail to distinguish subclasses of glasses. This scientific gap poses an issue to robotic applications that suffer from accumulating errors between detection, planning, and action execution. The paper introduces a novel method for the acquisition of real-world data from RGB-D sensors that minimizes human effort. We propose an auto-labeling pipeline that generates labels for all the acquired frames based on the depth measurements. We provide a novel real-world glass object dataset that was collected on the Neuro-Inspired COLlaborator (NICOL), a humanoid robot platform. The data set consists of 7850 images recorded from five different cameras. We show that our trained baseline model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary approaches. In addition, we deploy our baseline model in an embodied agent approach to the NICOL platform, on which it achieves a success rate of 81% in a human-robot bartending scenario.

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems are revolutionizing autonomous communication and collaboration, yet they remain vulnerable to security threats like unauthorized access and data breaches. To address this, we introduce AgentSafe, a novel framework that enhances MAS security through hierarchical information management and memory protection. AgentSafe classifies information by security levels, restricting sensitive data access to authorized agents. AgentSafe incorporates two components: ThreatSieve, which secures communication by verifying information authority and preventing impersonation, and HierarCache, an adaptive memory management system that defends against unauthorized access and malicious poisoning, representing the first systematic defense for agent memory. Experiments across various LLMs show that AgentSafe significantly boosts system resilience, achieving defense success rates above 80% under adversarial conditions. Additionally, AgentSafe demonstrates scalability, maintaining robust performance as agent numbers and information complexity grow. Results underscore effectiveness of AgentSafe in securing MAS and its potential for real-world application.

总结:
本工作关注于基于Transformer的世界模型在强化学习中的应用。针对以往使用Transformer替换RNN构建世界模型的方法虽提高了训练效率，但性能提升有限的问题，文章指出现有方法采用的下一状态预测目标不足以充分利用Transformer的表示能力。为此，文中提出了一个新的算法TWISTER（基于对比预测编码的Transformer世界模型），该算法通过引入动作条件化的对比预测编码来学习高层次的时间特征表示，从而提升了智能体的表现。实验结果显示，TWISTER在Atari 100k基准测试中达到了人类标准化均分的162%，创造了不使用look-ahead搜索的最新记录，超过了现有的先进方法。 <div>

Abstract: The DreamerV3 algorithm recently obtained remarkable performance across diverse environment domains by learning an accurate world model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Following the success of model-based reinforcement learning algorithms and the rapid adoption of the Transformer architecture for its superior training efficiency and favorable scaling properties, recent works such as STORM have proposed replacing RNN-based world models with Transformer-based world models using masked self-attention. However, despite the improved training efficiency of these methods, their impact on performance remains limited compared to the Dreamer algorithm, struggling to learn competitive Transformer-based world models. In this work, we show that the next state prediction objective adopted in previous approaches is insufficient to fully exploit the representation capabilities of Transformers. We propose to extend world model predictions to longer time horizons by introducing TWISTER (Transformer-based World model wIth contraSTivE Representations), a world model using action-conditioned Contrastive Predictive Coding to learn high-level temporal feature representations and improve the agent performance. TWISTER achieves a human-normalized mean score of 162% on the Atari 100k benchmark, setting a new record among state-of-the-art methods that do not employ look-ahead search.

Abstract: Creating digital models using Computer Aided Design (CAD) is a process that requires in-depth expertise. In industrial product development, this process typically involves entire teams of engineers, spanning requirements engineering, CAD itself, and quality assurance. We present an approach that mirrors this team structure with a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based Multi Agent System, with access to parametric CAD tooling and tool documentation. Combining agents for requirements engineering, CAD engineering, and vision-based quality assurance, a model is generated automatically from sketches and/ or textual descriptions. The resulting model can be refined collaboratively in an iterative validation loop with the user. Our approach has the potential to increase the effectiveness of design processes, both for industry experts and for hobbyists who create models for 3D printing. We demonstrate the potential of the architecture at the example of various design tasks and provide several ablations that show the benefits of the architecture's individual components.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents leverage the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs in real-world applications. To interface with an environment, these agents often rely on tools, such as web search or database APIs. As the agent provides the LLM with tool documentation along the user query, the completeness and correctness of this documentation is critical. However, tool documentation is often over-, under-, or ill-specified, impeding the agent's accuracy. Standard software testing approaches struggle to identify these errors as they are expressed in natural language. Thus, despite its importance, there currently exists no automated method to test the tool documentation for agents. To address this issue, we present ToolFuzz, the first method for automated testing of tool documentations. ToolFuzz is designed to discover two types of errors: (1) user queries leading to tool runtime errors and (2) user queries that lead to incorrect agent responses. ToolFuzz can generate a large and diverse set of natural inputs, effectively finding tool description errors at a low false positive rate. Further, we present two straightforward prompt-engineering approaches. We evaluate all three tool testing approaches on 32 common LangChain tools and 35 newly created custom tools and 2 novel benchmarks to further strengthen the assessment. We find that many publicly available tools suffer from underspecification. Specifically, we show that ToolFuzz identifies 20x more erroneous inputs compared to the prompt-engineering approaches, making it a key component for building reliable AI agents.

Abstract: First formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in his work "Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica", the concept of the Three-Body Problem was put forth as a study of the motion of the three celestial bodies within the Earth-Sun-Moon system. In a generalized definition, it seeks to predict the motion for an isolated system composed of three point masses freely interacting under Newton's law of universal attraction. This proves to be analogous to a multitude of interactions between celestial bodies, and thus, the problem finds applicability within the studies of celestial mechanics. Despite numerous attempts by renowned physicists to solve it throughout the last three centuries, no general closed-form solutions have been reached due to its inherently chaotic nature for most initial conditions. Current state-of-the-art solutions are based on two approaches, either numerical high-precision integration or machine learning-based. Notwithstanding the breakthroughs of neural networks, these present a significant limitation, which is their ignorance of any prior knowledge of the chaotic systems presented. Thus, in this work, we propose a novel method that utilizes Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). These deep neural networks are able to incorporate any prior system knowledge expressible as an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into their learning processes as a regularizing agent. Our findings showcase that PINNs surpass current state-of-the-art machine learning methods with comparable prediction quality. Despite a better prediction quality, the usability of numerical integrators suffers due to their prohibitively high computational cost. These findings confirm that PINNs are both effective and time-efficient open-form solvers of the Three-Body Problem that capitalize on the extensive knowledge we hold of classical mechanics.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) applications, including LLM app stores and autonomous agents, are shaping the future of AI ecosystems. However, platform silos, fragmented hardware integration, and the absence of standardized interfaces limit scalability, interoperability, and resource efficiency. While LLM app stores democratize AI, their closed ecosystems restrict modular AI reuse and cross-platform portability. Meanwhile, agent-based frameworks offer flexibility but often lack seamless integration across diverse environments. This paper envisions the future of LLM applications and proposes a three-layer decoupled architecture grounded in software engineering principles such as layered system design, service-oriented architectures, and hardware-software co-design. This architecture separates application logic, communication protocols, and hardware execution, enhancing modularity, efficiency, and cross-platform compatibility. Beyond architecture, we highlight key security and privacy challenges for safe, scalable AI deployment and outline research directions in software and security engineering. This vision aims to foster open, secure, and interoperable LLM ecosystems, guiding future advancements in AI applications.

Abstract: Survey paper plays a crucial role in scientific research, especially given the rapid growth of research publications. Recently, researchers have begun using LLMs to automate survey generation for better efficiency. However, the quality gap between LLM-generated surveys and those written by human remains significant, particularly in terms of outline quality and citation accuracy. To close these gaps, we introduce SurveyForge, which first generates the outline by analyzing the logical structure of human-written outlines and referring to the retrieved domain-related articles. Subsequently, leveraging high-quality papers retrieved from memory by our scholar navigation agent, SurveyForge can automatically generate and refine the content of the generated article. Moreover, to achieve a comprehensive evaluation, we construct SurveyBench, which includes 100 human-written survey papers for win-rate comparison and assesses AI-generated survey papers across three dimensions: reference, outline, and content quality. Experiments demonstrate that SurveyForge can outperform previous works such as AutoSurvey.

<div> 关键词: 多智能体强化学习、逆强化学习、边际Q学习、演示学习、协同竞争

总结:

本文提出了一种针对多智能体强化学习中奖励函数设计问题的新框架——多智能体边缘Q学习从演示（MAMQL）。在多智能体环境中，由于环境非平稳性和多个智能体带来的额外变异性，传统的单智能体逆强化学习方法难以准确平衡合作与竞争目标。MAMQL为每个智能体学习基于其他智能体策略边缘化的批评函数，从而合理地在多智能体场景中应用玻尔兹曼策略。通过揭示最优边缘化批评函数与单智能体软Q逆强化学习之间的联系，MAMQL能够在多智能体一般性博弈中应用简单直接的优化准则。实验结果显示，在三个不同模拟领域中，MAMQL在平均奖励、样本效率和奖励恢复方面均显著优于先前的多智能体方法，性能提升通常超过2-5倍。项目代码已在https://sites.google.com/view/mamql 上公开可用。 <div>

Abstract: When reward functions are hand-designed, deep reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from reward misspecification, causing them to learn suboptimal policies in terms of the intended task objectives. In the single-agent case, inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) techniques attempt to address this issue by inferring the reward function from expert demonstrations. However, in multi-agent problems, misalignment between the learned and true objectives is exacerbated due to increased environment non-stationarity and variance that scales with multiple agents. As such, in multi-agent general-sum games, multi-agent IRL algorithms have difficulty balancing cooperative and competitive objectives. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Agent Marginal Q-Learning from Demonstrations (MAMQL), a novel sample-efficient framework for multi-agent IRL. For each agent, MAMQL learns a critic marginalized over the other agents' policies, allowing for a well-motivated use of Boltzmann policies in the multi-agent context. We identify a connection between optimal marginalized critics and single-agent soft-Q IRL, allowing us to apply a direct, simple optimization criterion from the single-agent domain. Across our experiments on three different simulated domains, MAMQL significantly outperforms previous multi-agent methods in average reward, sample efficiency, and reward recovery by often more than 2-5x. We make our code available at https://sites.google.com/view/mamql .

总结:
本文介绍了针对医疗领域的推理增强型大语言模型评测研究。科研人员构建了一个名为MedR-Bench的专业医学评价基准，包含了1,453份结构化的患者病例和从案例报告中挖掘出的推理参考信息，覆盖了13个身体系统和10种专业疾病。他们提出了一套包括评估推荐、诊断决策和治疗规划三个关键临床阶段的综合评价框架，并设计了一个称为Reasoning Evaluator的新颖自动量化评分系统，以效率、事实性和完整性三个方面动态搜索和交叉验证自由文本推理响应。通过评估五种最先进的推理LLM，如DeepSeek-R1和OpenAI-o3-mini，发现当前的LLM在处理简单的诊断任务时能取得超过85%的准确率，但面对复杂的评估推荐和治疗规划任务则表现挣扎。虽然它们的推理过程总体可靠，事实性得分超过90%，但在推理步骤上常常遗漏重要信息，指出了当前临床LLM需要进一步发展的方向。 <div>

Abstract: The latest reasoning-enhanced large language models (reasoning LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o3, have demonstrated remarkable success. However, the application of such reasoning enhancements to the highly professional medical domain has not been clearly evaluated, particularly regarding with not only assessing the final generation but also examining the quality of their reasoning processes. In this study, we present MedR-Bench, a reasoning-focused medical evaluation benchmark comprising 1,453 structured patient cases with reasoning references mined from case reports. Our benchmark spans 13 body systems and 10 specialty disorders, encompassing both common and rare diseases. In our evaluation, we introduce a versatile framework consisting of three critical clinical stages: assessment recommendation, diagnostic decision-making, and treatment planning, comprehensively capturing the LLMs' performance across the entire patient journey in healthcare. For metrics, we propose a novel agentic system, Reasoning Evaluator, designed to automate and objectively quantify free-text reasoning responses in a scalable manner from the perspectives of efficiency, factuality, and completeness by dynamically searching and performing cross-referencing checks. As a result, we assess five state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, and others. Our results reveal that current LLMs can handle relatively simple diagnostic tasks with sufficient critical assessment results, achieving accuracy generally over 85%. However, they still struggle with more complex tasks, such as assessment recommendation and treatment planning. In reasoning, their reasoning processes are generally reliable, with factuality scores exceeding 90%, though they often omit critical reasoning steps. Our study clearly reveals further development directions for current clinical LLMs.

Abstract: Persuasion through conversation has been the focus of much research. Nudging is a popular strategy to influence decision-making in physical and digital settings. However, conversational agents employing "nudging" have not received significant attention. We explore the manifestation of cognitive biases-the underlying psychological mechanisms of nudging-and investigate how the complexity of prior dialogue tasks impacts decision-making facilitated by conversational agents. Our research used a between-group experimental design, involving 756 participants randomly assigned to either a simple or complex task before encountering a decision-making scenario. Three scenarios were adapted from Samuelson's classic experiments on status-quo bias, the underlying mechanism of default nudges. Our results aligned with previous studies in two out of three simple-task scenarios. Increasing task complexity consistently shifted effect-sizes toward our hypothesis, though bias was significant in only one case. These findings inform conversational nudging strategies and highlight inherent biases relevant to behavioural economics.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel distributed data-driven optimization scheme. In particular, we focus on the so-called aggregative framework, namely, the scenario in which a set of agents aim to cooperatively minimize the sum of local costs, each depending on both local decision variables and an aggregation of all of them. We consider a data-driven setup in which each objective function is unknown and can be only sampled at a single point per iteration (thanks to, e.g., feedback from human users or physical sensors). We address this scenario through a distributed algorithm that combines three key components: (i) a learning part that leverages neural networks to learn the local cost functions descent direction, (ii) an optimization routine that steers the estimates according to the learned direction to minimize the global cost, and (iii) a tracking mechanism that locally reconstructs the unavailable global quantities. By using tools from system theory, i.e., timescale separation and averaging theory, we formally prove that, in strongly convex setups, the overall distributed strategy linearly converges in a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose radius depends on the given accuracy capabilities of the neural networks. Finally, we corroborate the theoretical results with numerical simulations.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of controller synthesis of signal temporal logic (STL) specifications for large-scale multi-agent systems, where the agents are dynamically coupled and subject to collaborative tasks. A compositional framework based on continuous-time assume-guarantee contracts is developed to break the complex and large synthesis problem into subproblems of manageable sizes. We first show how to formulate the collaborative STL tasks as assume-guarantee contracts by leveraging the idea of funnel-based control. The concept of contracts is used to establish our compositionality result, which allows us to guarantee the satisfaction of a global contract by the multi-agent system when all agents satisfy their local contracts. Then, a closed-form continuous-time feedback controller is designed to enforce local contracts over the agents in a distributed manner, which further guarantees the global task satisfaction based on the compositionality result. Finally, the effectiveness of our results is demonstrated by two numerical examples.

Abstract: Recent LLM-driven visual agents mainly focus on solving image-based tasks, which limits their ability to understand dynamic scenes, making it far from real-life applications like guiding students in laboratory experiments and identifying their mistakes. Hence, this paper explores DoraemonGPT, a comprehensive and conceptually elegant system driven by LLMs to understand dynamic scenes. Considering the video modality better reflects the ever-changing nature of real-world scenarios, we exemplify DoraemonGPT as a video agent. Given a video with a question/task, DoraemonGPT begins by converting the input video into a symbolic memory that stores task-related attributes. This structured representation allows for spatial-temporal querying and reasoning by well-designed sub-task tools, resulting in concise intermediate results. Recognizing that LLMs have limited internal knowledge when it comes to specialized domains (e.g., analyzing the scientific principles underlying experiments), we incorporate plug-and-play tools to assess external knowledge and address tasks across different domains. Moreover, a novel LLM-driven planner based on Monte Carlo Tree Search is introduced to explore the large planning space for scheduling various tools. The planner iteratively finds feasible solutions by backpropagating the result's reward, and multiple solutions can be summarized into an improved final answer. We extensively evaluate DoraemonGPT's effectiveness on three benchmarks and several in-the-wild scenarios. The code will be released at https://github.com/z-x-yang/DoraemonGPT.

Abstract: Being able to map the activities of others into one's own point of view is one fundamental human skill even from a very early age. Taking a step toward understanding this human ability, we introduce EgoExoLearn, a large-scale dataset that emulates the human demonstration following process, in which individuals record egocentric videos as they execute tasks guided by demonstration videos. Focusing on the potential applications in daily assistance and professional support, EgoExoLearn contains egocentric and demonstration video data spanning 120 hours captured in daily life scenarios and specialized laboratories. Along with the videos we record high-quality gaze data and provide detailed multimodal annotations, formulating a playground for modeling the human ability to bridge asynchronous procedural actions from different viewpoints. To this end, we present benchmarks such as cross-view association, cross-view action planning, and cross-view referenced skill assessment, along with detailed analysis. We expect EgoExoLearn can serve as an important resource for bridging the actions across views, thus paving the way for creating AI agents capable of seamlessly learning by observing humans in the real world.

Abstract: Large language model agents have demonstrated remarkable advancements across various complex tasks. Recent works focus on optimizing the agent team or employing self-reflection to iteratively solve complex tasks. Since these agents are all based on the same LLM, only conducting self-evaluation or removing underperforming agents does not substantively enhance the capability of the agents. We argue that a comprehensive evaluation and accumulating experience from evaluation feedback is an effective approach to improving system performance. In this paper, we propose Reusable Experience Accumulation with 360$^\circ$ Assessment (360$^\circ$REA), a hierarchical multi-agent framework inspired by corporate organizational practices. The framework employs a novel 360$^\circ$ performance assessment method for multi-perspective performance evaluation with fine-grained assessment. To enhance the capability of agents in addressing complex tasks, we introduce dual-level experience pool for agents to accumulate experience through fine-grained assessment. Extensive experiments on complex task datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of 360$^\circ$REA.

Abstract: Social agents with finitely nested opponent models are vulnerable to manipulation by agents with deeper reasoning and more sophisticated opponent modelling. This imbalance, rooted in logic and the theory of recursive modelling frameworks, cannot be solved directly. We propose a computational framework, $\aleph$-IPOMDP, augmenting model-based RL agents' Bayesian inference with an anomaly detection algorithm and an out-of-belief policy. Our mechanism allows agents to realize they are being deceived, even if they cannot understand how, and to deter opponents via a credible threat. We test this framework in both a mixed-motive and zero-sum game. Our results show the $\aleph$ mechanism's effectiveness, leading to more equitable outcomes and less exploitation by more sophisticated agents. We discuss implications for AI safety, cybersecurity, cognitive science, and psychiatry.

Abstract: General intelligence requires quick adaption across tasks. While existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods have made progress in generalization, they typically assume only distribution changes between source and target domains. In this paper, we explore a wider range of scenarios where not only the distribution but also the environment spaces may change. For example, in the CoinRun environment, we train agents from easy levels and generalize them to difficulty levels where there could be new enemies that have never occurred before. To address this challenging setting, we introduce a causality-guided self-adaptive representation-based approach, called CSR, that equips the agent to generalize effectively across tasks with evolving dynamics. Specifically, we employ causal representation learning to characterize the latent causal variables within the RL system. Such compact causal representations uncover the structural relationships among variables, enabling the agent to autonomously determine whether changes in the environment stem from distribution shifts or variations in space, and to precisely locate these changes. We then devise a three-step strategy to fine-tune the causal model under different scenarios accordingly. Empirical experiments show that CSR efficiently adapts to the target domains with only a few samples and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of scenarios, including our simulated environments, CartPole, CoinRun and Atari games.

Abstract: Imitation learning from human demonstrations is an effective means to teach robots manipulation skills. But data acquisition is a major bottleneck in applying this paradigm more broadly, due to the amount of cost and human effort involved. There has been significant interest in imitation learning for bimanual dexterous robots, like humanoids. Unfortunately, data collection is even more challenging here due to the challenges of simultaneously controlling multiple arms and multi-fingered hands. Automated data generation in simulation is a compelling, scalable alternative to fuel this need for data. To this end, we introduce DexMimicGen, a large-scale automated data generation system that synthesizes trajectories from a handful of human demonstrations for humanoid robots with dexterous hands. We present a collection of simulation environments in the setting of bimanual dexterous manipulation, spanning a range of manipulation behaviors and different requirements for coordination among the two arms. We generate 21K demos across these tasks from just 60 source human demos and study the effect of several data generation and policy learning decisions on agent performance. Finally, we present a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline and deploy it on a real-world humanoid can sorting task.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to serve as general-purpose tools for various language-based tasks. Recent works have demonstrated that the efficacy of such models can be improved through iterative dialog between multiple models. While these paradigms show promise in improving model efficacy, most works in this area treat collaboration as an emergent behavior, rather than a learned behavior. In doing so, current multi-agent frameworks rely on collaborative behaviors to have been sufficiently trained into off-the-shelf models. To address this limitation, we propose ACC-Collab, an Actor-Critic based learning framework to produce a two-agent team (an actor-agent and a critic-agent) specialized in collaboration. We demonstrate that ACC-Collab outperforms SotA multi-agent techniques on a wide array of benchmarks.

<div> 关键词: 基石模型(FMs), 大规模推理模型(LRMs), 快速思考大型语言模型(LLMs), Watson, 调试性能

<br /><br />总结:
本文提出了一种名为Watson的新框架，旨在解决由快速思考LLMs驱动的自主运行软件代理的可观察性和调试性挑战。Watson能够提供对LLM隐含推理过程的可观测性，从而可以识别和定位错误并指导进行修正。通过在大规模多任务语言理解(MMLU)基准测试和SWE-bench-lite两个场景中的应用，证明了Watson恢复的隐含推理轨迹的准确性和实用性。使用Watson，研究者能够在运行时观察并识别出隐含推理错误，并自动提供针对性的纠正措施，无需更新模型或代理的认知架构，就使MMLU和SWE-bench-lite上的Pass@1指标分别提高了7.58个百分点（相对提升13.45%）和7.76个百分点（相对提升12.31%）。 <div>

Abstract: As foundation models (FMs) play an increasingly prominent role in complex software systems, such as agentic software, they introduce significant observability and debuggability challenges. Although recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate their thought processes as part of the output, in many scenarios fast-thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) are still preferred due to latency constraints. LLM-powered agents operate autonomously with opaque implicit reasoning, making it difficult to debug their unexpected behaviors or errors. In this paper, we introduce Watson, a novel framework that provides reasoning observability into the implicit reasoning processes of agents driven by fast-thinking LLMs, allowing the identification and localization of errors and guidance for corrections. We demonstrate the accuracy of the recovered implicit reasoning trace by Watson and its usefulness through debugging and improving the performance of LLM-powered agents in two scenarios: Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark and SWE-bench-lite. Using Watson, we were able to observe and identify the implicit reasoning errors, and automatically provide targeted corrections at runtime that improve the Pass@1 of agents on MMLU and SWE-bench-lite by 7.58 (13.45% relative improvement) and 7.76 (12.31% relative improvement) percentage points, respectively, without updates to models or the cognitive architecture of the agents.

Abstract: An embodied agent assisting humans is often asked to complete new tasks, and there may not be sufficient time or labeled examples to train the agent to perform these new tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on considerable knowledge across many domains can be used to predict a sequence of abstract actions for completing such tasks, although the agent may not be able to execute this sequence due to task-, agent-, or domain-specific constraints. Our framework addresses these challenges by leveraging the generic predictions provided by LLM and the prior domain knowledge encoded in a Knowledge Graph (KG), enabling an agent to quickly adapt to new tasks. The robot also solicits and uses human input as needed to refine its existing knowledge. Based on experimental evaluation in the context of cooking and cleaning tasks in simulation domains, we demonstrate that the interplay between LLM, KG, and human input leads to substantial performance gains compared with just using the LLM.

<div> 关键词: 大型语言模型 (LLMs)，知识图谱 (KGs)，R2-KG，推理框架，可信度

<br /><br />总结:
本文介绍了R2-KG，这是一个创新的、可插拔的双代理推理框架，旨在解决现有将LLMs与KG结合进行增强推理时存在的灵活性和可靠性问题。R2-KG将推理任务分为操作员（低容量的LLM）和监督器（高容量的LLM）两个角色，前者负责搜集证据，后者做出最终判断，从而实现成本效率更高的LLM推理并保持较高的推理准确性。此外，R2-KG引入了弃权机制，仅在从KG收集到充分证据时才生成答案，显著提升了可靠性。实验结果显示，无论使用何种内在能力的LLM作为操作员，R2-KG在基于KG的多项推理任务中均展现出在准确性和可靠性上的优越性能。进一步的实验表明，单代理版本的R2-KG在采用严格的自我一致性策略后，虽然提高了可靠性但也会导致在复杂KG中的弃权率提高。总的来说，R2-KG为基于KG的推理提供了一个灵活、低成本且确保可信推理的解决方案，减少了对高容量LLM的依赖。 <div>

Abstract: Recent studies have combined Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance reasoning, improving inference accuracy without additional training while mitigating hallucination. However, existing frameworks are often rigid, struggling to adapt to KG or task changes. They also rely heavily on powerful LLMs for reliable (i.e., trustworthy) reasoning. To address this, We introduce R2-KG, a plug-and-play, dual-agent framework that separates reasoning into two roles: an Operator (a low-capacity LLM) that gathers evidence and a Supervisor (a high-capacity LLM) that makes final judgments. This design is cost-efficient for LLM inference while still maintaining strong reasoning accuracy. Additionally, R2-KG employs an Abstention mechanism, generating answers only when sufficient evidence is collected from KG, which significantly enhances reliability. Experiments across multiple KG-based reasoning tasks show that R2-KG consistently outperforms baselines in both accuracy and reliability, regardless of the inherent capability of LLMs used as the Operator. Further experiments reveal that the single-agent version of R2-KG, equipped with a strict self-consistency strategy, achieves significantly higher-than-baseline reliability while reducing inference cost. However, it also leads to a higher abstention rate in complex KGs. Our findings establish R2-KG as a flexible and cost-effective solution for KG-based reasoning. It reduces reliance on high-capacity LLMs while ensuring trustworthy inference.

Abstract: Environment configuration is a critical yet time-consuming step in software development, especially when dealing with unfamiliar code repositories. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate the potential to accomplish software engineering tasks, existing methods for environment configuration often rely on manual efforts or fragile scripts, leading to inefficiencies and unreliable outcomes. We introduce Repo2Run, the first LLM-based agent designed to fully automate environment configuration and generate executable Dockerfiles for arbitrary Python repositories. We address two major challenges: (1) enabling the LLM agent to configure environments within isolated Docker containers, and (2) ensuring the successful configuration process is recorded and accurately transferred to a Dockerfile without error. To achieve this, we propose atomic configuration synthesis, featuring a dual-environment architecture (internal and external environment) with a rollback mechanism to prevent environment "pollution" from failed commands, guaranteeing atomic execution (execute fully or not at all) and a Dockerfile generator to transfer successful configuration steps into runnable Dockerfiles. We evaluate Repo2Run~on our proposed benchmark of 420 recent Python repositories with unit tests, where it achieves an 86.0% success rate, outperforming the best baseline by 63.9%. Repo2Run is available at https://github.com/bytedance/Repo2Run.

本文研究了基于大型语言模型的自动评估方法中偏好传递性的假设。通过分析AlpacaEval框架内的非传递性偏好的存在及其对模型排名的影响，发现当前常用的基线比较方式可能导致敏感且不稳定的排名结果。为解决这一问题，文章提出采用结合Bradley-Terry模型的轮转锦标赛方法来生成更可靠的排名，结果显示这种方法提高了与Chatbot Arena的相关性（Spearman相关性和Kendall相关性分别提升至96.4%和86.3%）。为了降低轮转锦标赛的计算成本，文中还提出了使用动态匹配策略的瑞士制智慧迭代配对（Swim）锦标赛方案。 <div>

Abstract: Automatic evaluation methods based on large language models (LLMs) are emerging as the standard tool for assessing the instruction-following abilities of LLM-based agents. The most common method in this paradigm, pairwise comparisons with a baseline model, critically depends on the assumption of transitive preferences. However, the validity of this assumption remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the presence of non-transitivity within the AlpacaEval framework and analyze its effects on model rankings. We find that LLM judges exhibit non-transitive preferences, leading to rankings that are sensitive to the choice of the baseline model. To mitigate this issue, we show that round-robin tournaments combined with Bradley-Terry models of preference can produce more reliable rankings. Notably, our method increases both the Spearman correlation and the Kendall correlation with Chatbot Arena (95.0% -> 96.4% and 82.1% -> 86.3% respectively). To address the computational cost of round-robin tournaments, we propose Swiss-Wise Iterative Matchmaking (Swim) tournaments, using a dynamic matching strategy to capture the benefits of round-robin tournaments while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We present the development and analysis of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to solve continuous-space mean field game (MFG) and mean field control (MFC) problems in a unified manner. The proposed approach pairs the actor-critic (AC) paradigm with a representation of the mean field distribution via a parameterized score function, which can be efficiently updated in an online fashion, and uses Langevin dynamics to obtain samples from the resulting distribution. The AC agent and the score function are updated iteratively to converge, either to the MFG equilibrium or the MFC optimum for a given mean field problem, depending on the choice of learning rates. A straightforward modification of the algorithm allows us to solve mixed mean field control games (MFCGs). The performance of our algorithm is evaluated using linear-quadratic benchmarks in the asymptotic infinite horizon framework.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly gained popularity across all parts of society, including education. After initial skepticism and bans, many schools have chosen to embrace this new technology by integrating it into their curricula in the form of virtual tutors and teaching assistants. However, neither the companies developing this technology nor the public institutions involved in its implementation have set up a formal system to collect feedback from the stakeholders impacted by them. In this paper, we argue that understanding the perceptions of those directly affected by LLMS in the classroom, such as students and teachers, as well as those indirectly impacted, like parents and school staff, is essential for ensuring responsible use of AI in this critical domain. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we present results of a literature review focusing on the perceptions of LLM-based chatbots in education. We highlight important gaps in the literature, such as the exclusion of key educational agents (e.g., parents or school administrators) when analyzing the role of stakeholders, and the frequent omission of the learning contexts in which the AI systems are implemented. Thus, we present a taxonomy that organizes existing literature on stakeholder perceptions. Second, we propose the Contextualized Perceptions for the Adoption of Chatbots in Education (Co-PACE) framework, which can be used to systematically elicit perceptions and inform whether and how LLM-based chatbots should be designed, developed, and deployed in the classroom.

Abstract: Efficient path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is crucial in remote sensing and information collection. As task scales expand, the cooperative deployment of multiple UAVs significantly improves information collection efficiency. However, collaborative communication and decision-making for multiple UAVs remain major challenges in path planning, especially in noisy environments. To efficiently accomplish complex information collection tasks in 3D space and address robust communication issues, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for UAV path planning based on the Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients (COMA) algorithm. The framework incorporates attention mechanism-based UAV communication protocol and training-deployment system, significantly improving communication robustness and individual decision-making capabilities in noisy conditions. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing algorithms in terms of path planning efficiency and robustness, especially in noisy environments, achieving a 78\% improvement in entropy reduction.

总结：
本文提出了一种利用图神经网络变分自编码器（GNN-VAE）解决大规模多智能体协调问题的新方法，该方法针对共享空间中如自动化仓库内的可靠多机器人导航。在高密度机器人交通区域，局部协调方法可能无法找到无死锁的解决方案，因此文章建议由中央单元生成全局调度以决定机器人的通行顺序。然而，中心化协调方法的运行时间会随着问题规模增大而显著增加。通过将协调问题形式化为图问题并使用混合整数线性规划（MILP）求解器收集地面真实数据，研究训练了一个学习框架，将其编码到潜在空间中。在推理阶段，从采样的潜在变量中解码解决方案样本，并选择最低成本的样本用于协调。最后，选取性能指数最高的可行提案进行部署。由于设计结构的原因，GNN-VAE 框架返回的解决方案始终尊重所考虑的协调问题的约束条件。数值结果表明，即使对于拥有250个机器人的大规模问题，本方法在经过小规模问题训练后仍能实现高质量的解决方案，并且速度远超其他基线方法。项目页面： <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent coordination is crucial for reliable multi-robot navigation in shared spaces such as automated warehouses. In regions of dense robot traffic, local coordination methods may fail to find a deadlock-free solution. In these scenarios, it is appropriate to let a central unit generate a global schedule that decides the passing order of robots. However, the runtime of such centralized coordination methods increases significantly with the problem scale. In this paper, we propose to leverage Graph Neural Network Variational Autoencoders (GNN-VAE) to solve the multi-agent coordination problem at scale faster than through centralized optimization. We formulate the coordination problem as a graph problem and collect ground truth data using a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) solver. During training, our learning framework encodes good quality solutions of the graph problem into a latent space. At inference time, solution samples are decoded from the sampled latent variables, and the lowest-cost sample is selected for coordination. Finally, the feasible proposal with the highest performance index is selected for the deployment. By construction, our GNN-VAE framework returns solutions that always respect the constraints of the considered coordination problem. Numerical results show that our approach trained on small-scale problems can achieve high-quality solutions even for large-scale problems with 250 robots, being much faster than other baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), initially developed for generative AI, are now evolving into agentic AI systems, which make decisions in complex, real-world contexts. Unfortunately, while their generative capabilities are well-documented, their decision-making processes remain poorly understood. This is particularly evident when models are handling exceptions, a critical and challenging aspect of decision-making made relevant by the inherent incompleteness of contracts. Here we demonstrate that LLMs, even ones that excel at reasoning, deviate significantly from human judgments because they adhere strictly to policies, even when such adherence is impractical, suboptimal, or even counterproductive. We then evaluate three approaches to tuning AI agents to handle exceptions: ethical framework prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning. We find that while ethical framework prompting fails and chain-of-thought prompting provides only slight improvements, supervised fine-tuning, specifically with human explanations, yields markedly better results. Surprisingly, in our experiments, supervised fine-tuning even enabled models to generalize human-like decision-making to novel scenarios, demonstrating transfer learning of human-aligned decision-making across contexts. Furthermore, fine-tuning with explanations, not just labels, was critical for alignment, suggesting that aligning LLMs with human judgment requires explicit training on how decisions are made, not just which decisions are made. These findings highlight the need to address LLMs' shortcomings in handling exceptions in order to guide the development of agentic AI toward models that can effectively align with human judgment and simultaneously adapt to novel contexts.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), which focuses on finding collision-free paths for multiple robots, is crucial for applications ranging from aerial swarms to warehouse automation. Solving MAPF is NP-hard so learning-based approaches for MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep neural networks. Nonetheless, despite the community's continued efforts, all learning-based MAPF planners still rely on decentralized planning due to variability in the number of agents and map sizes. We have developed the first centralized learning-based policy for MAPF problem called RAILGUN. RAILGUN is not an agent-based policy but a map-based policy. By leveraging a CNN-based architecture, RAILGUN can generalize across different maps and handle any number of agents. We collect trajectories from rule-based methods to train our model in a supervised way. In experiments, RAILGUN outperforms most baseline methods and demonstrates great zero-shot generalization capabilities on various tasks, maps and agent numbers that were not seen in the training dataset.

Abstract: Autonomous agents and systems cover a number of application areas, from robotics and digital assistants to combinatorial optimization, all sharing common, unresolved research challenges. It is not sufficient for agents to merely solve a given task; they must generalize to out-of-distribution tasks, perform reliably, and use hardware resources efficiently during training and inference, among other requirements. Several methods, such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning, are commonly used to tackle these problems, each with different trade-offs. However, there is a lack of benchmarking suites that define the environments, datasets, and metrics which can be used to provide a meaningful way for the community to compare progress on applying these methods to real-world problems. We introduce A2Perf--a benchmark with three environments that closely resemble real-world domains: computer chip floorplanning, web navigation, and quadruped locomotion. A2Perf provides metrics that track task performance, generalization, system resource efficiency, and reliability, which are all critical to real-world applications. Using A2Perf, we demonstrate that web navigation agents can achieve latencies comparable to human reaction times on consumer hardware, reveal reliability trade-offs between algorithms for quadruped locomotion, and quantify the energy costs of different learning approaches for computer chip-design. In addition, we propose a data cost metric to account for the cost incurred acquiring offline data for imitation learning and hybrid algorithms, which allows us to better compare these approaches. A2Perf also contains several standard baselines, enabling apples-to-apples comparisons across methods and facilitating progress in real-world autonomy. As an open-source benchmark, A2Perf is designed to remain accessible, up-to-date, and useful to the research community over the long term.

Abstract: Data wrangling is a time-consuming and challenging task in a data science pipeline. While many tools have been proposed to automate or facilitate data wrangling, they often misinterpret user intent, especially in complex tasks. We propose Dango, a mixed-initiative multi-agent system for data wrangling. Compared to existing tools, Dango enhances user communication of intent by allowing users to demonstrate on multiple tables and use natural language prompts in a conversation interface, enabling users to clarify their intent by answering LLM-posed multiple-choice clarification questions, and providing multiple forms of feedback such as step-by-step natural language explanations and data provenance to help users evaluate the data wrangling scripts. We conducted a within-subjects user study with 38 participants and demonstrated that Dango's features can significantly improve intent clarification, accuracy, and efficiency in data wrangling. Furthermore, we demonstrated the generalizability of Dango by applying it to a broader set of data wrangling tasks.

Abstract: Reliable simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms are necessary for safety-critical autonomous navigation. In the communication-constrained multi-agent setting, navigation systems increasingly use point-to-point range sensors as they afford measurements with low bandwidth requirements and known data association. The state estimation problem for these systems takes the form of range-aided (RA) SLAM. However, distributed algorithms for solving the RA-SLAM problem lack formal guarantees on the quality of the returned estimate. To this end, we present the first distributed algorithm for RA-SLAM that can efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions. Our algorithm, distributed certifiably correct RA-SLAM (DCORA), achieves this via the Riemannian Staircase method, where computational procedures developed for distributed certifiably correct pose graph optimization are generalized to the RA-SLAM problem. We demonstrate DCORA's efficacy on real-world multi-agent datasets by achieving absolute trajectory errors comparable to those of a state-of-the-art centralized certifiably correct RA-SLAM algorithm. Additionally, we perform a parametric study on the structure of the RA-SLAM problem using synthetic data, revealing how common parameters affect DCORA's performance.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show amazing abilities in assisting human-computer interaction, automating human user's navigation on digital devices. An ideal GUI agent is expected to achieve high accuracy, low latency, and compatibility for different GUI platforms. Recent vision-based approaches have shown promise by leveraging advanced Vision Language Models (VLMs). While they generally meet the requirements of compatibility and low latency, these vision-based GUI agents tend to have low accuracy due to their limitations in element grounding. To address this issue, we propose $\textbf{SpiritSight}$, a vision-based, end-to-end GUI agent that excels in GUI navigation tasks across various GUI platforms. First, we create a multi-level, large-scale, high-quality GUI dataset called $\textbf{GUI-Lasagne}$ using scalable methods, empowering SpiritSight with robust GUI understanding and grounding capabilities. Second, we introduce the $\textbf{Universal Block Parsing (UBP)}$ method to resolve the ambiguity problem in dynamic high-resolution of visual inputs, further enhancing SpiritSight's ability to ground GUI objects. Through these efforts, SpiritSight agent outperforms other advanced methods on diverse GUI benchmarks, demonstrating its superior capability and compatibility in GUI navigation tasks.

Abstract: Solving mathematical problems using computer-verifiable languages like Lean has significantly impacted mathematical and computer science communities. State-of-the-art methods utilize single Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents or provers to either generate complete proof or perform tree searches. However, single-agent methods inherently lack a structured way to combine high-level reasoning in Natural Language (NL) with Formal Language (FL) verification feedback. To solve these issues, we propose MA-LoT: Multi-Agent Lean-based Long Chain-of-Thought framework, (to the best of our knowledge), the first multi-agent framework for Lean4 theorem proving that balance high-level NL reasoning and FL verification in Long CoT. Using this structured interaction, our approach enables deeper insights and long-term coherence in proof generation, with which past methods struggle. We do this by leveraging emergent formal reasoning ability in Long CoT using our novel LoT-Transfer Learning training-inference pipeline. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves 54.51% accuracy rate on the Lean4 version of MiniF2F-Test dataset, largely outperforming GPT-4 (22.95%), single-agent tree search (InternLM-Step-Prover, 50.70%), and whole-proof generation (DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5, 48.36%) baselines. Furthermore, our findings highlight the potential of combining Long CoT with formal verification for a more insightful generation in a broader perspective.

Abstract: Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) requires the integration and reasoning of diverse multimodal data, presenting significant challenges in deriving actionable insights. Traditional approaches, including multimodal large language models (MLLMs), often struggle to infer complex contextual relationships or deliver comprehensive intelligence from unstructured data sources. In this paper, we introduce COSINT-Agent, a knowledge-driven multimodal agent tailored to address the challenges of OSINT in the Chinese domain. COSINT-Agent seamlessly integrates the perceptual capabilities of fine-tuned MLLMs with the structured reasoning power of the Entity-Event-Scene Knowledge Graph (EES-KG). Central to COSINT-Agent is the innovative EES-Match framework, which bridges COSINT-MLLM and EES-KG, enabling systematic extraction, reasoning, and contextualization of multimodal insights. This integration facilitates precise entity recognition, event interpretation, and context retrieval, effectively transforming raw multimodal data into actionable intelligence. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of COSINT-Agent across core OSINT tasks, including entity recognition, EES generation, and context matching. These results underscore its potential as a robust and scalable solution for advancing automated multimodal reasoning and enhancing the effectiveness of OSINT methodologies.

<div> 关键词: 自主防御代理人、深度强化学习、密集奖励、稀疏奖励、网络节点

总结:
近年来，基于深度强化学习的自主网络安全防御代理研究热度激增。大多数现有的网络安全模拟器（又称“网络健身房”）提供了密集型的“辅助式”奖励函数，然而这种函数可能引导代理找到次优解。本文旨在探究稀疏奖励函数是否能训练出更有效的防御代理。为此，文章首先指出了现有工作中存在的评价局限性，并提出了一种超越标准强化学习范式的地面真实评估分数。通过适应一个已有的网络健身房并引入该方法和地面真实分数，作者提出了两种稀疏奖励机制并与典型的密集奖励进行对比。实验结果显示，稀疏奖励（特别是对未被破坏网络状态的正向强化）能够训练出更有效的网络安全防御代理，并且其提供的训练稳定性超过密集奖励。此外，稀疏奖励的有效性和训练稳定性对于各种网络规模（从2到50个节点）以及反应式和主动式防御行动都表现出较强的鲁棒性。 <div>

Abstract: The last few years has seen an explosion of interest in autonomous cyber defence agents based on deep reinforcement learning. Such agents are typically trained in a cyber gym environment, also known as a cyber simulator, at least 32 of which have already been built. Most, if not all cyber gyms provide dense "scaffolded" reward functions which combine many penalties or incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Whilst dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments, yielding seemingly effective strategies from relatively few environment steps; they are also known to bias the solutions an agent can find, potentially towards suboptimal solutions. Sparse rewards could offer preferable or more effective solutions and have been overlooked by cyber gyms to date. In this work we set out to evaluate whether sparse reward functions might enable training more effective cyber defence agents. Towards this goal we first break down several evaluation limitations in existing work by proposing a ground truth evaluation score that goes beyond the standard RL paradigm used to train and evaluate agents. By adapting a well-established cyber gym to accommodate our methodology and ground truth score, we propose and evaluate two sparse reward mechanisms and compare them with a typical dense reward. Our evaluation considers a range of network sizes, from 2 to 50 nodes, and both reactive and proactive defensive actions. Our results show that sparse rewards, particularly positive reinforcement for an uncompromised network state, enable the training of more effective cyber defence agents. Furthermore, we show that sparse rewards provide more stable training than dense rewards, and that both effectiveness and training stability are robust to a variety of cyber environment considerations.

Abstract: Event cameras deliver visual information characterized by a high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, offering significant advantages in estimating optical flow for complex lighting conditions and fast-moving objects. Current advanced optical flow methods for event cameras largely adopt established image-based frameworks. However, the spatial sparsity of event data limits their performance. In this paper, we present BAT, an innovative framework that estimates event-based optical flow using bidirectional adaptive temporal correlation. BAT includes three novel designs: 1) a bidirectional temporal correlation that transforms bidirectional temporally dense motion cues into spatially dense ones, enabling accurate and spatially dense optical flow estimation; 2) an adaptive temporal sampling strategy for maintaining temporal consistency in correlation; 3) spatially adaptive temporal motion aggregation to efficiently and adaptively aggregate consistent target motion features into adjacent motion features while suppressing inconsistent ones. Our results rank $1^{st}$ on the DSEC-Flow benchmark, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin while also exhibiting sharp edges and high-quality details. Notably, our BAT can accurately predict future optical flow using only past events, significantly outperforming E-RAFT's warm-start approach.

Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there has been growing interest in Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for graph-based tasks. By leveraging LLMs as predictors, GFMs have demonstrated impressive generalizability across various tasks and datasets. However, existing research on LLMs as predictors has predominantly focused on static graphs, leaving their potential in dynamic graph prediction unexplored. In this work, we pioneer using LLMs for predictive tasks on dynamic graphs. We identify two key challenges: the constraints imposed by context length when processing large-scale historical data and the significant variability in domain characteristics, both of which complicate the development of a unified predictor. To address these challenges, we propose the GraphAgent-Dynamic (GAD) Framework, a multi-agent system that leverages collaborative LLMs. In contrast to using a single LLM as the predictor, GAD incorporates global and local summary agents to generate domain-specific knowledge, enhancing its transferability across domains. Additionally, knowledge reflection agents enable adaptive updates to GAD's knowledge, maintaining a unified and self-consistent architecture. In experiments, GAD demonstrates performance comparable to or even exceeds that of full-supervised graph neural networks without dataset-specific training. Finally, to enhance the task-specific performance of LLM-based predictors, we discuss potential improvements, such as dataset-specific fine-tuning to LLMs. By developing tailored strategies for different tasks, we provide new insights for the future design of LLM-based predictors.

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching methods typically use costly 3D convolutions to aggregate a full cost volume, but their computational demands make mobile deployment challenging. Directly applying 2D convolutions for cost aggregation often results in edge blurring, detail loss, and mismatches in textureless regions. Some complex operations, like deformable convolutions and iterative warping, can partially alleviate this issue; however, they are not mobile-friendly, limiting their deployment on mobile devices. In this paper, we present a novel bilateral aggregation network (BANet) for mobile stereo matching that produces high-quality results with sharp edges and fine details using only 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first separate the full cost volume into detailed and smooth volumes using a spatial attention map, then perform detailed and smooth aggregations accordingly, ultimately fusing both to obtain the final disparity map. Additionally, to accurately identify high-frequency detailed regions and low-frequency smooth/textureless regions, we propose a new scale-aware spatial attention module. Experimental results demonstrate that our BANet-2D significantly outperforms other mobile-friendly methods, achieving 35.3\% higher accuracy on the KITTI 2015 leaderboard than MobileStereoNet-2D, with faster runtime on mobile devices. The extended 3D version, BANet-3D, achieves the highest accuracy among all real-time methods on high-end GPUs. Code: \textcolor{magenta}{https://github.com/gangweiX/BANet}.

Abstract: As the potential for autonomous vehicles to be integrated on a large scale into modern traffic systems continues to grow, ensuring safe navigation in dynamic environments is crucial for smooth integration. To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods and devises a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms discussed in the literature. In addition, the paper discusses active research areas within trajectory prediction, addresses the posed research questions, and highlights the remaining research gaps and challenges.

Abstract: Finding enjoyable fiction books can be challenging, partly because stories are multi-faceted and one's own literary taste might be difficult to ascertain. Here, we introduce the ISAAC method (Introspection-Support, AI-Annotation, and Curation), a pipeline which supports fiction readers in gaining awareness of their literary preferences and finding enjoyable books. ISAAC consists of four steps: a user supplies book ratings, an AI agent researches and annotates the provided books, patterns in book enjoyment are reviewed by the user, and the AI agent recommends new books. In this proof-of-concept self-study, the authors test whether ISAAC can highlight idiosyncratic patterns in their book enjoyment, spark a deeper reflection about their literary tastes, and make accurate, personalized recommendations of enjoyable books and underexplored literary niches. Results highlight substantial advantages of ISAAC over existing methods such as an integration of automation and intuition, accurate and customizable annotations, and explainable book recommendations. Observed disadvantages are that ISAAC's outputs can elicit false self-narratives (if statistical patterns are taken at face value), that books cannot be annotated if their online documentation is lacking, and that people who are new to reading have to rely on assumed book ratings or movie ratings to power the ISAAC pipeline. We discuss additional opportunities of ISAAC-style book annotations for the study of literary trends, and the scientific classification of books and readers.

<div> 关键词: Open Domain Event Detection (ODED), 自动评价, 评估基准, 语义级评价框架, 大规模语言模型

总结:
本文提出了一个针对开放域事件检测(ODED)的可扩展且可靠的语义级评价框架SEOE。该框架旨在解决现有评价方法面临的两个问题：一是受限的评价基准缺乏对真实世界的代表性，难以准确反映各类ODED方法在实际场景中的性能；二是基于token级别匹配规则的评价指标无法捕捉预测结果与黄金标签之间的语义相似性。SEOE首先构建了一个包含7大领域、564种事件类型的更具代表性的评价基准，并采用了一种成本效益高的补充标注策略，便于未来添加新的事件类型和领域。接着，SEOE利用大规模语言模型作为自动评价代理来计算语义F1分数，通过引入细粒度的语义相似标签定义以增强评价的可靠性。实验验证了新基准的代表性以及语义评价指标的可靠性，并对现有ODED方法进行了深入评估，分析了预测错误模式，揭示了一系列有价值的发现。 <div>

Abstract: Automatic evaluation for Open Domain Event Detection (ODED) is a highly challenging task, because ODED is characterized by a vast diversity of un-constrained output labels from various domains. Nearly all existing evaluation methods for ODED usually first construct evaluation benchmarks with limited labels and domain coverage, and then evaluate ODED methods using metrics based on token-level label matching rules. However, this kind of evaluation framework faces two issues: (1) The limited evaluation benchmarks lack representatives of the real world, making it difficult to accurately reflect the performance of various ODED methods in real-world scenarios; (2) Evaluation metrics based on token-level matching rules fail to capture semantic similarity between predictions and golden labels. To address these two problems above, we propose a scalable and reliable Semantic-level Evaluation framework for Open domain Event detection (SEOE) by constructing a more representative evaluation benchmark and introducing a semantic evaluation metric. Specifically, our proposed framework first constructs a scalable evaluation benchmark that currently includes 564 event types covering 7 major domains, with a cost-effective supplementary annotation strategy to ensure the benchmark's representativeness. The strategy also allows for the supplement of new event types and domains in the future. Then, the proposed SEOE leverages large language models (LLMs) as automatic evaluation agents to compute a semantic F1-score, incorporating fine-grained definitions of semantically similar labels to enhance the reliability of the evaluation. Extensive experiments validate the representatives of the benchmark and the reliability of the semantic evaluation metric. Existing ODED methods are thoroughly evaluated, and the error patterns of predictions are analyzed, revealing several insightful findings.

总结:
本文关注的是移动边缘计算(MEC)赋能的空地一体化网络(MAGIN)，该网络利用无人机(UAV)和高空平台站(HAPS)为地面物联网设备(IoTDs)提供动态服务。针对实时应用对高计算资源和严格服务质量(QoS)保障的需求，文章提出了一个联合优化UAV轨迹、计算资源分配以及队列感知的任务卸载决策的整体能耗最小化问题。由于此多层系统的非凸性和非线性特性，传统的解决方法难以奏效。为了解决这一问题，文章将原问题重新定义为具有连续动作空间和异质代理的多智能体马尔科夫决策过程(MDP)，并提出了一种新颖的多智能体亲和度策略优化带Beta分布(MAPPO-BD)算法来求解。通过大量的仿真实验表明，与基准方案相比，MAPPO-BD算法在满足队列延迟和边缘计算约束的同时，能实现MAGIN中更优的能量节省和高效的资源管理。 <div>

Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled air-ground networks are a key component of 6G, employing aerial base stations (ABSs) such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) to provide dynamic services to ground IoT devices (IoTDs). These IoTDs support real-time applications (e.g., multimedia and Metaverse services) that demand high computational resources and strict quality of service (QoS) guarantees in terms of latency and task queue management. Given their limited energy and processing capabilities, IoTDs rely on UAVs and HAPS to offload tasks for distributed processing, forming a multi-tier MEC system. This paper tackles the overall energy minimization problem in MEC-enabled air-ground integrated networks (MAGIN) by jointly optimizing UAV trajectories, computing resource allocation, and queue-aware task offloading decisions. The optimization is challenging due to the nonconvex, nonlinear nature of this hierarchical system, which renders traditional methods ineffective. We reformulate the problem as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) with continuous action spaces and heterogeneous agents, and propose a novel variant of multi-agent proximal policy optimization with a Beta distribution (MAPPO-BD) to solve it. Extensive simulations show that MAPPO-BD outperforms baseline schemes, achieving superior energy savings and efficient resource management in MAGIN while meeting queue delay and edge computing constraints.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception enhances perceptual capabilities by utilizing information from multiple agents and is considered a fundamental solution to the problem of weak single-vehicle perception in autonomous driving. However, existing collaborative perception methods face a dilemma between communication efficiency and perception accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel communication-efficient collaborative perception framework based on supply-demand awareness and intermediate-late hybridization, dubbed as \mymethodname. By modeling the supply-demand relationship between agents, the framework refines the selection of collaboration regions, reducing unnecessary communication cost while maintaining accuracy. In addition, we innovatively introduce the intermediate-late hybrid collaboration mode, where late-stage collaboration compensates for the performance degradation in collaborative perception under low communication bandwidth. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, including both simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrate that \mymethodname~ achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy and optimal bandwidth trade-offs, delivering superior detection precision under real communication bandwidths, thus proving its effectiveness and practical applicability. The code will be released at https://github.com/Xu2729/CoSDH.

Abstract: How capable are large language models (LLMs) in the domain of taxation? Although numerous studies have explored the legal domain in general, research dedicated to taxation remain scarce. Moreover, the datasets used in these studies are either simplified, failing to reflect the real-world complexities, or unavailable as open source. To address this gap, we introduce PLAT, a new benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to predict the legitimacy of additional tax penalties. PLAT is constructed to evaluate LLMs' understanding of tax law, particularly in cases where resolving the issue requires more than just applying related statutes. Our experiments with six LLMs reveal that their baseline capabilities are limited, especially when dealing with conflicting issues that demand a comprehensive understanding. However, we found that enabling retrieval, self-reasoning, and discussion among multiple agents with specific role assignments, this limitation can be mitigated.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities across domains, tasks, and languages (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT-4), reviving the research of general autonomous agents with human-like cognitive abilities.Such human-level agents require semantic comprehension and instruction-following capabilities, which exactly fall into the strengths of LLMs.Although there have been several initial attempts to build human-level agents based on LLMs, the theoretical foundation remains a challenging open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical cognitive architecture, the Unified Mind Model (UMM), which offers guidance to facilitate the rapid creation of autonomous agents with human-level cognitive abilities. Specifically, our UMM starts with the global workspace theory and further leverage LLMs to enable the agent with various cognitive abilities, such as multi-modal perception, planning, reasoning, tool use, learning, memory, reflection and motivation. Building upon UMM, we then develop an agent-building engine, MindOS, which allows users to quickly create domain-/task-specific autonomous agents without any programming effort.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm in the domain of Open-Domain Dialogue agents predominantly focuses on the English language, encompassing both models and datasets. Furthermore, the financial and temporal investments required for crowdsourcing such datasets for finetuning are substantial, particularly when multiple languages are involved. Fortunately, advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have unveiled a plethora of possibilities across diverse tasks. Specifically, instruction-tuning has enabled LLMs to execute tasks based on natural language instructions, occasionally surpassing the performance of human crowdworkers. Additionally, these models possess the capability to function in various languages within a single thread. Consequently, to generate new samples in different languages, we propose leveraging these capabilities to replicate the data collection process. We introduce a pipeline for generating Open-Domain Dialogue data in multiple Target Languages using LLMs, with demonstrations provided in a unique Source Language. By eschewing explicit Machine Translation in this approach, we enhance the adherence to language-specific nuances. We apply this methodology to the PersonaChat dataset. To enhance the openness of generated dialogues and mimic real life scenarii, we added the notion of speech events corresponding to the type of conversation the speakers are involved in and also that of common ground which represents the premises of a conversation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model(LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems(MAS) have demonstrated remarkable potential for tackling complex decision-making tasks. However, existing frameworks inevitably rely on serialized execution paradigms, where agents must complete sequential LLM planning before taking action. This fundamental constraint severely limits real-time responsiveness and adaptation, which is crucial in dynamic environments with ever-changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel parallelized planning-acting framework for LLM-based MAS, featuring a dual-thread architecture with interruptible execution to enable concurrent planning and acting. Specifically, our framework comprises two core threads:(1) a planning thread driven by a centralized memory system, maintaining synchronization of environmental states and agent communication to support dynamic decision-making; and (2) an acting thread equipped with a comprehensive skill library, enabling automated task execution through recursive decomposition. Extensive experiments on challenging Minecraft demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Traffic simulation is essential for autonomous vehicle (AV) development, enabling comprehensive safety evaluation across diverse driving conditions. However, traditional rule-based simulators struggle to capture complex human interactions, while data-driven approaches often fail to maintain long-term behavioral realism or generate diverse safety-critical events. To address these challenges, we propose TeraSim, an open-source, high-fidelity traffic simulation platform designed to uncover unknown unsafe events and efficiently estimate AV statistical performance metrics, such as crash rates. TeraSim is designed for seamless integration with third-party physics simulators and standalone AV stacks, to construct a complete AV simulation system. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating diverse safety-critical events involving both static and dynamic agents, identifying hidden deficiencies in AV systems, and enabling statistical performance evaluation. These findings highlight TeraSim's potential as a practical tool for AV safety assessment, benefiting researchers, developers, and policymakers.

Abstract: Autonomous motion planning under unknown nonlinear dynamics presents significant challenges. An agent needs to continuously explore the system dynamics to acquire its properties, such as reachability, in order to guide system navigation adaptively. In this paper, we propose a hybrid planning-control framework designed to compute a feasible trajectory toward a target. Our approach involves partitioning the state space and approximating the system by a piecewise affine (PWA) system with constrained control inputs. By abstracting the PWA system into a directed weighted graph, we incrementally update the existence of its edges via affine system identification and reach control theory, introducing a predictive reachability condition by exploiting prior information of the unknown dynamics. Heuristic weights are assigned to edges based on whether their existence is certain or remains indeterminate. Consequently, we propose a framework that adaptively collects and analyzes data during mission execution, continually updates the predictive graph, and synthesizes a controller online based on the graph search outcomes. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulation scenarios involving a mobile robot operating in unknown terrains, with its unknown dynamics abstracted as a single integrator model.

Abstract: The convergence of generative artificial intelligence and advanced computer vision technologies introduces a groundbreaking approach to transforming textual descriptions into three-dimensional representations. This research proposes a fully automated pipeline that seamlessly integrates text-to-image generation, various image processing techniques, and deep learning methods for reflection removal and 3D reconstruction. By leveraging state-of-the-art generative models like Stable Diffusion, the methodology translates natural language inputs into detailed 3D models through a multi-stage workflow.
  The reconstruction process begins with the generation of high-quality images from textual prompts, followed by enhancement by a reinforcement learning agent and reflection removal using the Stable Delight model. Advanced image upscaling and background removal techniques are then applied to further enhance visual fidelity. These refined two-dimensional representations are subsequently transformed into volumetric 3D models using sophisticated machine learning algorithms, capturing intricate spatial relationships and geometric characteristics. This process achieves a highly structured and detailed output, ensuring that the final 3D models reflect both semantic accuracy and geometric precision.
  This approach addresses key challenges in generative reconstruction, such as maintaining semantic coherence, managing geometric complexity, and preserving detailed visual information. Comprehensive experimental evaluations will assess reconstruction quality, semantic accuracy, and geometric fidelity across diverse domains and varying levels of complexity. By demonstrating the potential of AI-driven 3D reconstruction techniques, this research offers significant implications for fields such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and digital content creation.

Abstract: We present Attentive Reasoning Queries (ARQs), a novel structured reasoning approach that significantly improves instruction-following in Large Language Models through domain-specialized reasoning blueprints. While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they often fail to maintain adherence to complex, use-case-specific instructions during multi-turn conversations, presenting challenges for business-critical applications. ARQs address this limitation by guiding LLMs through systematic reasoning steps with targeted queries that reinstate critical instructions and facilitate intermediate reasoning throughout the completion process. In extensive testing within Parlant, our framework for reliable customer-facing agents in which ARQs were born out of necessity, they achieved a 90.2% success rate across 87 test scenarios, outperforming both Chain-of-Thought reasoning (86.1%) and direct response generation (81.5%). ARQs showed particular strength in addressing persistent failure modes like guideline re-application and hallucination prevention. Our analysis also revealed that ARQs can potentially be more computationally efficient than free-form reasoning when carefully designed. These findings demonstrate that structured reasoning approaches provide effective mechanisms for controlling how LLMs process information and make decisions in complex scenarios.

Central to our framework is a comprehensive mathematical characterization of strictly installable, based on the desired solution concept and the behavior's structure. These characterizations lead to efficient iterative algorithms, which we generalize to handle optimization objectives through linear programming. Finally, we explore how our results generalize to bounded rational agents.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown significant potential in tackling diverse tasks. However, to design effective MAS, existing approaches heavily rely on manual configurations or multiple calls of advanced LLMs, resulting in inadaptability and high inference costs. In this paper, we simplify the process of building an MAS by reframing it as a generative language task, where the input is a user query and the output is a corresponding MAS. To address this novel task, we unify the representation of MAS as executable code and propose a consistency-oriented data construction pipeline to create a high-quality dataset comprising coherent and consistent query-MAS pairs. Using this dataset, we train MAS-GPT, an open-source medium-sized LLM that is capable of generating query-adaptive MAS within a single LLM inference. The generated MAS can be seamlessly applied to process user queries and deliver high-quality responses. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmarks and 5 LLMs show that the proposed MAS-GPT consistently outperforms 10+ baseline MAS methods on diverse settings, indicating MAS-GPT's high effectiveness, efficiency and strong generalization ability.

These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps leading to undesirable agent actions when executing the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link the victim query to the malicious reasoning steps. During the injection of the malicious record, we propose an indication prompt to guide the agent to autonomously generate our designed bridging steps. We also propose a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing the victim query comes after. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting practical risks of LLM agents.

<div> 关键词：视觉语言模型(VLM)，移动设备操作，子任务，约束高频优化规划(CHOP)，多代理架构

<br /><br />总结:
本文提出了针对视觉语言模型在移动端操作系统中应用的新框架——约束高频优化规划（CHOP）。现有的VLM基移动助手在子任务层面存在两个挑战：一是低层代理无法执行的无效子任务，二是未能有效推进高层任务完成的低效子任务。这些挑战源于VLM在GUI场景下的多代理架构中缺乏子任务分解经验。为解决这些问题，CHOP架构利用人类预先规划的子任务作为基础向量，弥补了VLM在GUI场景规划中的不足。该研究分别在英语和汉语环境中，跨20款App进行了评估，显示出了在效果和效率上的显著提升。相关数据集和代码已公开发布在https://github.com/Yuqi-Zhou/CHOP上。 <div>

Abstract: The advancement of visual language models (VLMs) has enhanced mobile device operations, allowing simulated human-like actions to address user requirements. Current VLM-based mobile operating assistants can be structured into three levels: task, subtask, and action. The subtask level, linking high-level goals with low-level executable actions, is crucial for task completion but faces two challenges: ineffective subtasks that lower-level agent cannot execute and inefficient subtasks that fail to contribute to the completion of the higher-level task. These challenges stem from VLM's lack of experience in decomposing subtasks within GUI scenarios in multi-agent architecture. To address these, we propose a new mobile assistant architecture with constrained high-frequency o}ptimized planning (CHOP). Our approach overcomes the VLM's deficiency in GUI scenarios planning by using human-planned subtasks as the basis vector. We evaluate our architecture in both English and Chinese contexts across 20 Apps, demonstrating significant improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency.

<div> 关键词: 大型语言模型、诚实性、基准测试、准确性、干预措施

<br /><br />总结: 本文关注大型语言模型（LLMs）的诚实性问题，指出随着LLMs能力增强和自主性提高，对其输出的信任度需求增大，但同时存在模型可能为达成目标而撒谎的担忧。现有的诚实性评估有限，缺乏大规模且适用于各类模型的基准测试，并且许多声称衡量诚实性的基准实际上只是在衡量模型信念的正确性（即准确性）。为此，文章提出了一项由人类收集的大规模诚实性测量数据集，首次能够将准确性和诚实性区分开来。研究发现，虽然更大规模的模型在基准测试上的准确性更高，但它们并未变得更诚实。令人惊讶的是，尽管前沿LLMs在真实性基准测试上得分较高，但在面临压力时却表现出显著的撒谎倾向，导致在新提出的诚实性基准测试上的得分较低。文章还发现，简单的表示学习干预方法可以提高模型的诚实性。这些结果强调了对LLMs进行稳健评估和有效干预以确保其保持可信赖的重要性。 <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and agentic, the requirement for trust in their outputs grows significantly, yet at the same time concerns have been mounting that models may learn to lie in pursuit of their goals. To address these concerns, a body of work has emerged around the notion of "honesty" in LLMs, along with interventions aimed at mitigating deceptive behaviors. However, evaluations of honesty are currently highly limited, with no benchmark combining large scale and applicability to all models. Moreover, many benchmarks claiming to measure honesty in fact simply measure accuracy--the correctness of a model's beliefs--in disguise. In this work, we introduce a large-scale human-collected dataset for measuring honesty directly, allowing us to disentangle accuracy from honesty for the first time. Across a diverse set of LLMs, we find that while larger models obtain higher accuracy on our benchmark, they do not become more honest. Surprisingly, while most frontier LLMs obtain high scores on truthfulness benchmarks, we find a substantial propensity in frontier LLMs to lie when pressured to do so, resulting in low honesty scores on our benchmark. We find that simple methods, such as representation engineering interventions, can improve honesty. These results underscore the growing need for robust evaluations and effective interventions to ensure LLMs remain trustworthy.

Abstract: Realistic and interactive surgical simulation has the potential to facilitate crucial applications, such as medical professional training and autonomous surgical agent training. In the natural visual domain, world models have enabled action-controlled data generation, demonstrating the potential to train autonomous agents in interactive simulated environments when large-scale real data acquisition is infeasible. However, such works in the surgical domain have been limited to simplified computer simulations, and lack realism. Furthermore, existing literature in world models has predominantly dealt with action-labeled data, limiting their applicability to real-world surgical data, where obtaining action annotation is prohibitively expensive. Inspired by the recent success of Genie in leveraging unlabeled video game data to infer latent actions and enable action-controlled data generation, we propose the first surgical vision world model. The proposed model can generate action-controllable surgical data and the architecture design is verified with extensive experiments on the unlabeled SurgToolLoc-2022 dataset.

<div> 关键词: 样本复杂度、机器学习、零误差、可改善代理、改进能力

<br /><br />总结:
该文探讨了在机器学习中，当数据点（即代理）具有能通过努力提高自身属性以达到正向分类的能力时，允许代理改善的现象可能使我们实现零误差学习。文章指出，在一些非琐碎场景下，至少需要 $1/\epsilon$ 个样本才能将错误率降低到 $\epsilon$。然而，如果存在改进空间，只需对阈值做出接近真实的估计 $\hat{\theta}$（满足 $\theta \leq \hat{\theta} \leq \theta + r$），就有可能让所有真正合格的代理通过努力被正确分类。文中进一步研究了这种现象的一般性结果以及在何种条件下，代理的改进能力可以减少学习所需的样本复杂度，或者相反，可能会使得学习变得更加困难。同时，文章从理论和实证两方面分析了如何设计能够考虑有限改进意愿与能力的改进型算法。 <div>

Abstract: One of the most basic lower bounds in machine learning is that in nearly any nontrivial setting, it takes $\textit{at least}$ $1/\epsilon$ samples to learn to error $\epsilon$ (and more, if the classifier being learned is complex). However, suppose that data points are agents who have the ability to improve by a small amount if doing so will allow them to receive a (desired) positive classification. In that case, we may actually be able to achieve $\textit{zero}$ error by just being "close enough". For example, imagine a hiring test used to measure an agent's skill at some job such that for some threshold $\theta$, agents who score above $\theta$ will be successful and those who score below $\theta$ will not (i.e., learning a threshold on the line). Suppose also that by putting in effort, agents can improve their skill level by some small amount $r$. In that case, if we learn an approximation $\hat{\theta}$ of $\theta$ such that $\theta \leq \hat{\theta} \leq \theta + r$ and use it for hiring, we can actually achieve error zero, in the sense that (a) any agent classified as positive is truly qualified, and (b) any agent who truly is qualified can be classified as positive by putting in effort. Thus, the ability for agents to improve has the potential to allow for a goal one could not hope to achieve in standard models, namely zero error.
  In this paper, we explore this phenomenon more broadly, giving general results and examining under what conditions the ability of agents to improve can allow for a reduction in the sample complexity of learning, or alternatively, can make learning harder. We also examine both theoretically and empirically what kinds of improvement-aware algorithms can take into account agents who have the ability to improve to a limited extent when it is in their interest to do so.

Abstract: Molecular optimization is a crucial yet complex and time-intensive process that often acts as a bottleneck for drug development. Traditional methods rely heavily on trial and error, making multi-objective optimization both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Current AI-based methods have shown limited success in handling multi-objective optimization tasks, hampering their practical utilization. To address this challenge, we present MultiMol, a collaborative large language model (LLM) system designed to guide multi-objective molecular optimization. MultiMol comprises two agents, including a data-driven worker agent and a literature-guided research agent. The data-driven worker agent is a large language model being fine-tuned to learn how to generate optimized molecules considering multiple objectives, while the literature-guided research agent is responsible for searching task-related literature to find useful prior knowledge that facilitates identifying the most promising optimized candidates. In evaluations across six multi-objective optimization tasks, MultiMol significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 82.30% success rate, in sharp contrast to the 27.50% success rate of current strongest methods. To further validate its practical impact, we tested MultiMol on two real-world challenges. First, we enhanced the selectivity of Xanthine Amine Congener (XAC), a promiscuous ligand that binds both A1R and A2AR, successfully biasing it towards A1R. Second, we improved the bioavailability of Saquinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor with known bioavailability limitations. Overall, these results indicate that MultiMol represents a highly promising approach for multi-objective molecular optimization, holding great potential to accelerate the drug development process and contribute to the advancement of pharmaceutical research.

Abstract: The answering quality of an aligned large language model (LLM) can be drastically improved if treated with proper crafting of prompts. In this paper, we propose ExpertPrompting to elicit the potential of LLMs to answer as distinguished experts. We first utilize In-Context Learning to automatically synthesize detailed and customized descriptions of the expert identity for each specific instruction, and then ask LLMs to provide answer conditioned on such agent background. Based on this augmented prompting strategy, we produce a new set of instruction-following data using GPT-3.5, and train a competitive open-source chat assistant called ExpertLLaMA. We employ GPT4-based evaluation to show that 1) the expert data is of significantly higher quality than vanilla answers, and 2) ExpertLLaMA outperforms existing open-source opponents and achieves 96\% of the original ChatGPT's capability. All data and the ExpertLLaMA model will be made publicly available at https://github.com/OFA-Sys/ExpertLLaMA.

总结:
本文研究了在具有 Oblivious 敌对环境的强化学习问题，即对抗性马尔科夫决策过程中（Adversarial MDPs）的学习策略。在每个由 $H$ 阶段组成的 $T$ 期互动中，奖励函数仅在每期结束时揭晓。文章提出了一种名为 APO-MVP 的新算法，该算法实现了 $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly}(H)\sqrt{SAT})$ 的后悔界限，这一结果比此前最佳已知界限提高了 $\sqrt{S}$ 因子，从而弥合了对抗性和确定性 MDPs 之间的差距，并在 $S,A,T$ 的依赖关系上匹配了最小最大下界 $\Omega(\sqrt{H^3SAT})$。APO-MVP 算法基于动态规划和针对估计优势函数的黑盒在线线性优化策略进行政策优化，易于实现。其分析利用了两项最新技术：基于在线线性优化策略的政策优化（Jonckheere等人，2023年）以及关于通过估计转移核对值影响的精细鞅分析（Zhang等人，2023年）。 <div>

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning in adversarial Markov decision processes [MDPs] with an oblivious adversary in a full-information setting. The agent interacts with an environment during $T$ episodes, each of which consists of $H$ stages, and each episode is evaluated with respect to a reward function that will be revealed only at the end of the episode. We propose an algorithm, called APO-MVP, that achieves a regret bound of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly}(H)\sqrt{SAT})$, where $S$ and $A$ are sizes of the state and action spaces, respectively. This result improves upon the best-known regret bound by a factor of $\sqrt{S}$, bridging the gap between adversarial and stochastic MDPs, and matching the minimax lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{H^3SAT})$ as far as the dependencies in $S,A,T$ are concerned. The proposed algorithm and analysis completely avoid the typical tool given by occupancy measures; instead, it performs policy optimization based only on dynamic programming and on a black-box online linear optimization strategy run over estimated advantage functions, making it easy to implement. The analysis leverages two recent techniques: policy optimization based on online linear optimization strategies (Jonckheere et al., 2023) and a refined martingale analysis of the impact on values of estimating transitions kernels (Zhang et al., 2023).

Abstract: Due to the growing complexity of modern Integrated Circuits (ICs), automating hardware design can prevent a significant amount of human error from the engineering process and result in less errors. Verilog is a popular hardware description language for designing and modeling digital systems; thus, Verilog generation is one of the emerging areas of research to facilitate the design process. In this work, we propose VerilogCoder, a system of multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Verilog code generation, to autonomously write Verilog code and fix syntax and functional errors using collaborative Verilog tools (i.e., syntax checker, simulator, and waveform tracer). Firstly, we propose a task planner that utilizes a novel Task and Circuit Relation Graph retrieval method to construct a holistic plan based on module descriptions. To debug and fix functional errors, we develop a novel and efficient abstract syntax tree (AST)-based waveform tracing tool, which is integrated within the autonomous Verilog completion flow. The proposed methodology successfully generates 94.2% syntactically and functionally correct Verilog code, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by 33.9% on the VerilogEval-Human v2 benchmark.

Abstract: A continual learning agent builds on previous experiences to develop increasingly complex behaviors by adapting to non-stationary and dynamic environments while preserving previously acquired knowledge. However, scaling these systems presents significant challenges, particularly in balancing the preservation of previous policies with the adaptation of new ones to current environments. This balance, known as the stability-plasticity dilemma, is especially pronounced in complex multi-agent domains such as the train scheduling problem, where environmental and agent behaviors are constantly changing, and the search space is vast. In this work, we propose addressing these challenges in the train scheduling problem using curriculum learning. We design a curriculum with adjacent skills that build on each other to improve generalization performance. Introducing a curriculum with distinct tasks introduces non-stationarity, which we address by proposing a new algorithm: Continual Deep Q-Network (DQN) Expansion (CDE). Our approach dynamically generates and adjusts Q-function subspaces to handle environmental changes and task requirements. CDE mitigates catastrophic forgetting through EWC while ensuring high plasticity using adaptive rational activation functions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in learning efficiency and adaptability compared to RL baselines and other adapted methods for continual learning, highlighting the potential of our method in managing the stability-plasticity dilemma in the adaptive train scheduling setting.

Abstract: Learning in zero-sum games studies a situation where multiple agents competitively learn their strategy. In such multi-agent learning, we often see that the strategies cycle around their optimum, i.e., Nash equilibrium. When a game periodically varies (called a ``periodic'' game), however, the Nash equilibrium moves generically. How learning dynamics behave in such periodic games is of interest but still unclear. Interestingly, we discover that the behavior is highly dependent on the relationship between the two speeds at which the game changes and at which players learn. We observe that when these two speeds synchronize, the learning dynamics diverge, and their time-average does not converge. Otherwise, the learning dynamics draw complicated cycles, but their time-average converges. Under some assumptions introduced for the dynamical systems analysis, we prove that this behavior occurs. Furthermore, our experiments observe this behavior even if removing these assumptions. This study discovers a novel phenomenon, i.e., synchronization, and gains insight widely applicable to learning in periodic games.

Abstract: Reliable embodied perception from an egocentric perspective is challenging yet essential for autonomous navigation technology of intelligent mobile agents. With the growing demand of social robotics, near-field scene understanding becomes an important research topic in the areas of egocentric perceptual tasks related to navigation in both crowded and unstructured environments. Due to the complexity of environmental conditions and difficulty of surrounding obstacles owing to truncation and occlusion, the perception capability under this circumstance is still inferior. To further enhance the intelligence of mobile robots, in this paper, we setup an egocentric multi-sensor data collection platform based on 3 main types of sensors (Camera, LiDAR and Fisheye), which supports flexible sensor configurations to enable dynamic sight of view from ego-perspective, capturing either near or farther areas. Meanwhile, a large-scale multimodal dataset is constructed, named RoboSense, to facilitate egocentric robot perception. Specifically, RoboSense contains more than 133K synchronized data with 1.4M 3D bounding box and IDs annotated in the full $360^{\circ}$ view, forming 216K trajectories across 7.6K temporal sequences. It has $270\times$ and $18\times$ as many annotations of surrounding obstacles within near ranges as the previous datasets collected for autonomous driving scenarios such as KITTI and nuScenes. Moreover, we define a novel matching criterion for near-field 3D perception and prediction metrics. Based on RoboSense, we formulate 6 popular tasks to facilitate the future research development, where the detailed analysis as well as benchmarks are also provided accordingly. Data desensitization measures have been conducted for privacy protection.

Abstract: Multi-UAV pursuit-evasion, where pursuers aim to capture evaders, poses a key challenge for UAV swarm intelligence. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated potential in modeling cooperative behaviors, but most RL-based approaches remain constrained to simplified simulations with limited dynamics or fixed scenarios. Previous attempts to deploy RL policy to real-world pursuit-evasion are largely restricted to two-dimensional scenarios, such as ground vehicles or UAVs at fixed altitudes. In this paper, we address multi-UAV pursuit-evasion by considering UAV dynamics and physical constraints. We introduce an evader prediction-enhanced network to tackle partial observability in cooperative strategy learning. Additionally, we propose an adaptive environment generator within MARL training, enabling higher exploration efficiency and better policy generalization across diverse scenarios. Simulations show our method significantly outperforms all baselines in challenging scenarios, generalizing to unseen scenarios with a 100% capture rate. Finally, we derive a feasible policy via a two-stage reward refinement and deploy the policy on real quadrotors in a zero-shot manner. To our knowledge, this is the first work to derive and deploy an RL-based policy using collective thrust and body rates control commands for multi-UAV pursuit-evasion in unknown environments.

<br /><br />总结：
本文提出了一种使用多智能体强化学习的分布式策略网络，用于实现多无人机系统的时间最优飞行。该方法通过引入受到优化方法启发的软碰撞自由机制，在保证飞行效率的同时，确保了碰撞规避。利用集中式训练、分布式执行（CTDE）方式定制PPO算法，提升了训练效率和稳定性，并保证了轻量级实施。模拟实验表明，相较于单无人机系统，提出的多无人机方法能在保持接近时间最优性能的同时，具有较低的碰撞率。真实世界实验中，两个四旋翼无人机采用与模拟相同的网络，在一个5.5m*5.5m*2.0m的空间内，在各种轨道上实现了最大速度13.65 m/s和最大机身角速度13.4 rad/s的表现，全程依赖于机载计算。 <div>

Abstract: Recent innovations in autonomous drones have facilitated time-optimal flight in single-drone configurations, and enhanced maneuverability in multi-drone systems by applying optimal control and learning-based methods. However, few studies have achieved time-optimal motion planning for multi-drone systems, particularly during highly agile maneuvers or in dynamic scenarios. This paper presents a decentralized policy network using multi-agent reinforcement learning for time-optimal multi-drone flight. To strike a balance between flight efficiency and collision avoidance, we introduce a soft collision-free mechanism inspired by optimization-based methods. By customizing PPO in a centralized training, decentralized execution (CTDE) fashion, we unlock higher efficiency and stability in training while ensuring lightweight implementation. Extensive simulations show that, despite slight performance trade-offs compared to single-drone systems, our multi-drone approach maintains near-time-optimal performance with a low collision rate. Real-world experiments validate our method, with two quadrotors using the same network as in simulation achieving a maximum speed of 13.65 m/s and a maximum body rate of 13.4 rad/s in a 5.5 m * 5.5 m * 2.0 m space across various tracks, relying entirely on onboard computation.

<div> 关键词：zero-shot策略迁移，探索，价值函数准确性，可达性，Explore-Go

总结:
本文关注零样本策略迁移（ZSPT）场景下上下文马尔科夫决策过程（MDP）中的智能体学习问题。研究发现，虽然增加探索可以提升泛化能力，但也可能降低所学价值函数的准确性。文章提出了“可达性”概念，用于定义在ZSPT设置中需要泛化的状态和上下文，并阐述了为何探索能改进它。作者假设并证明在保证准确性的前提下增加覆盖范围和探索能够进一步提高泛化效果。为此，他们提出了一种名为Explore-Go的方法，该方法在每个episode开始时实施探索阶段，可与现有的在线和离线RL算法结合使用，即使在部分可观测MDP中也能显著提升泛化性能。实验结果表明，当将Explore-Go与其他流行算法相结合时，其在多个环境中均显示出提高了泛化性能。通过这一简单修改，文章旨在为从业者提供一种改进智能体泛化能力的有效手段。 <div>

Abstract: In the zero-shot policy transfer (ZSPT) setting for contextual Markov decision processes (MDP), agents train on a fixed set of contexts and must generalise to new ones. Recent work has argued and demonstrated that increased exploration can improve this generalisation, by training on more states in the training contexts. In this paper, we demonstrate that training on more states can indeed improve generalisation, but can come at a cost of reducing the accuracy of the learned value function which should not benefit generalisation. We introduce reachability in the ZSPT setting to define which states/contexts require generalisation and explain why exploration can improve it. We hypothesise and demonstrate that using exploration to increase the agent's coverage while also increasing the accuracy improves generalisation even more. Inspired by this, we propose a method Explore-Go that implements an exploration phase at the beginning of each episode, which can be combined with existing on- and off-policy RL algorithms and significantly improves generalisation even in partially observable MDPs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Explore-Go when combined with several popular algorithms and show an increase in generalisation performance across several environments. With this, we hope to provide practitioners with a simple modification that can improve the generalisation of their agents.

Abstract: Understanding human locomotion is crucial for AI agents such as robots, particularly in complex indoor home environments. Modeling human trajectories in these spaces requires insight into how individuals maneuver around physical obstacles and manage social navigation dynamics. These dynamics include subtle behaviors influenced by proxemics - the social use of space, such as stepping aside to allow others to pass or choosing longer routes to avoid collisions. Previous research has developed datasets of human motion in indoor scenes, but these are often limited in scale and lack the nuanced social navigation dynamics common in home environments. To address this, we present LocoVR, a dataset of 7000+ two-person trajectories captured in virtual reality from over 130 different indoor home environments. LocoVR provides accurate trajectory data and precise spatial information, along with rich examples of socially-motivated movement behaviors. For example, the dataset captures instances of individuals navigating around each other in narrow spaces, adjusting paths to respect personal boundaries in living areas, and coordinating movements in high-traffic zones like entryways and kitchens. Our evaluation shows that LocoVR significantly enhances model performance in three practical indoor tasks utilizing human trajectories, and demonstrates predicting socially-aware navigation patterns in home environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved reasonable quality improvements in machine translation (MT). However, most current research on MT-LLMs still faces significant challenges in maintaining translation consistency and accuracy when processing entire documents. In this paper, we introduce DelTA, a Document-levEL Translation Agent designed to overcome these limitations. DelTA features a multi-level memory structure that stores information across various granularities and spans, including Proper Noun Records, Bilingual Summary, Long-Term Memory, and Short-Term Memory, which are continuously retrieved and updated by auxiliary LLM-based components. Experimental results indicate that DelTA significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of translation consistency and quality across four open/closed-source LLMs and two representative document translation datasets, achieving an increase in consistency scores by up to 4.58 percentage points and in COMET scores by up to 3.16 points on average. DelTA employs a sentence-by-sentence translation strategy, ensuring no sentence omissions and offering a memory-efficient solution compared to the mainstream method. Furthermore, DelTA improves pronoun and context-dependent translation accuracy, and the summary component of the agent also shows promise as a tool for query-based summarization tasks. The code and data of our approach are released at https://github.com/YutongWang1216/DocMTAgent.

Abstract: StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) has been one of the most commonly used experimental environments in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the specific task is to control a set number of allied units to defeat enemy forces. Traditional MARL algorithms often require interacting with the environment for millions of steps to train a parametric model, of which the resulting policies are typically non-interpretable with weak transferability. In this paper, we introduce SMAC-R1 which is based on the Qwen2.5-7B-Base LLM distilled from DeepSeek-Coder-v2.5-236B. Similar to online reinforcement learning after behavior cloning in offline learning process, in our pipeline, agents leverage the DeepSeek LLM to generate decision tree code by providing task descriptions, and the agents are further self-reflected using feedback from the rewards provided by the environment. Based on that, we augment the generated scripts to fine-tune a small LLM, Qwen2.5-7B-Base, to distill the decision-making ability via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and enhance the script generation ability by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. We conduct experiments in the original 23 SMAC tasks and 10 newly-designed tasks to demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality, interpretable decision trees with minimal environmental exploration. Moreover, these scripts exhibit strong transferability, successfully applying to homogeneous SMAC environments without modification. We believe this approach offers a new direction for solving decision-making tasks and domain-specific LLM training pipelines in the future.

Abstract: The joint detection and tracking of a moving target embedded in an unknown disturbance represents a key feature that motivates the development of the cognitive radar paradigm. Building upon recent advancements in robust target detection with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars, this work explores the application of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework to enhance the tracking and detection tasks in a statistically unknown environment. In the POMDP setup, the radar system is considered as an intelligent agent that continuously senses the surrounding environment, optimizing its actions to maximize the probability of detection $(P_D)$ and improve the target position and velocity estimation, all this while keeping a constant probability of false alarm $(P_{FA})$. The proposed approach employs an online algorithm that does not require any apriori knowledge of the noise statistics, and it relies on a much more general observation model than the traditional range-azimuth-elevation model employed by conventional tracking algorithms. Simulation results clearly show substantial performance improvement of the POMDP-based algorithm compared to the State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA)-based one that has been recently investigated in the context of massive MIMO (MMIMO) radar systems.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery has been a long-standing goal within the research community, driven by the potential to accelerate knowledge creation. While significant progress has been made using commercial large language models (LLMs) as research assistants or idea generators, the possibility of automating the entire research process with open-source LLMs remains largely unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of using open-source post-trained LLMs as autonomous agents capable of performing the full cycle of automated research and review, from literature review and manuscript preparation to peer review and paper refinement. Our iterative preference training framework consists of CycleResearcher, which conducts research tasks, and CycleReviewer, which simulates the peer review process, providing iterative feedback via reinforcement learning. To train these models, we develop two new datasets, Review-5k and Research-14k, reflecting real-world machine learning research and peer review dynamics. Our results demonstrate that CycleReviewer achieves promising performance with a 26.89\% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to individual human reviewers in predicting paper scores, indicating the potential of LLMs to effectively assist expert-level research evaluation. In research, the papers generated by the CycleResearcher model achieved a score of 5.36 in simulated peer reviews, showing some competitiveness in terms of simulated review scores compared to the preprint level of 5.24 from human experts, while still having room for improvement compared to the accepted paper level of 5.69. This work represents a significant step toward fully automated scientific inquiry, providing ethical safeguards and exploring AI-driven research capabilities.

Abstract: The principles of automation and innovation serve as foundational elements for advancement in contemporary science and technology. Here, we introduce Pygen, an automation platform designed to empower researchers, technologists, and hobbyists to bring abstract ideas to life as core, usable software tools written in Python. Pygen leverages the immense power of autoregressive large language models to augment human creativity during the ideation, iteration, and innovation process. By combining state-of-the-art language models with open-source code generation technologies, Pygen has significantly reduced the manual overhead of tool development. From a user prompt, Pygen automatically generates Python packages for a complete workflow from concept to package generation and documentation. The findings of our work show that Pygen considerably enhances the researcher's productivity by enabling the creation of resilient, modular, and well-documented packages for various specialized purposes. We employ a prompt enhancement approach to distill the user's package description into increasingly specific and actionable. While being inherently an open-ended task, we have evaluated the generated packages and the documentation using Human Evaluation, LLM-based evaluation, and CodeBLEU, with detailed results in the results section. Furthermore, we documented our results, analyzed the limitations, and suggested strategies to alleviate them. Pygen is our vision of ethical automation, a framework that promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and collaborative development. This project marks the beginning of a large-scale effort towards creating tools where intelligent agents collaborate with humans to improve scientific and technological development substantially.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has drawn attention to their potential for accelerating drug discovery. However, a central problem remains: translating theoretical ideas into robust implementations in the highly specialized context of pharmaceutical research. This limitation prevents practitioners from making full use of the latest AI developments in drug discovery. To address this challenge, we introduce DrugAgent, a multi-agent framework that automates machine learning (ML) programming for drug discovery tasks. DrugAgent employs an LLM Planner that formulates high-level ideas and an LLM Instructor that identifies and integrates domain knowledge when implementing those ideas. We present case studies on three representative drug discovery tasks. Our results show that DrugAgent consistently outperforms leading baselines, including a relative improvement of 4.92% in ROC-AUC compared to ReAct for drug-target interaction (DTI).

Abstract: This letter presents a distributed trajectory planning method for multi-agent aerial tracking. The proposed method uses a Dynamic Buffered Voronoi Cell (DBVC) and a Dynamic Inter-Visibility Cell (DIVC) to formulate the distributed trajectory generation. Specifically, the DBVC and the DIVC are time-variant spaces that prevent mutual collisions and occlusions among agents, while enabling them to maintain suitable distances from the moving target. We combine the DBVC and the DIVC with an efficient Bernstein polynomial motion primitive-based tracking generation method, which has been refined into a less conservative approach than in our previous work. The proposed algorithm can compute each agent's trajectory within several milliseconds on an Intel i7 desktop. We validate the tracking performance in challenging scenarios, including environments with dozens of obstacles.

Abstract: Multi-Access Point Coordination (MAPC) and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) are expected to be key features in future Wi-Fi, such as the forthcoming IEEE 802.11bn (Wi-Fi~8) and beyond. In this paper, we explore a coordinated solution based on online learning to drive the optimization of Spatial Reuse (SR), a method that allows multiple devices to perform simultaneous transmissions by controlling interference through Packet Detect (PD) adjustment and transmit power control. In particular, we focus on a Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandit (MA-MAB) setting, where multiple decision-making agents concurrently configure SR parameters from coexisting networks by leveraging the MAPC framework, and study various algorithms and reward-sharing mechanisms. We evaluate different MA-MAB implementations using Komondor, a well-adopted Wi-Fi simulator, and demonstrate that AI-native SR enabled by coordinated MABs can improve the network performance over current Wi-Fi operation: mean throughput increases by 15%, fairness is improved by increasing the minimum throughput across the network by 210%, while the maximum access delay is kept below 3 ms.

<br /><br />总结:

本文介绍了利用神经符号方法来处理法律政策、物理限制和操作偏好的影响下对代理人行为预测的挑战。提出了一个新的方法——宪政滤波器（CoFi），它是一种用于贝叶斯估计的框架，能够基于人类可解释的神经符号模型（称为宪法模型）来预测遵守规则的代理人的预期行为。CoFi通过结合专家知识、深度学习架构以及考虑环境不确定性，提升了对代理人轨迹跟踪的效果，并能与像粒子滤波器等广泛应用的技术兼容。通过在真实世界的海洋交通数据上的评估，文章不仅证明了CoFi的性能优势，还展示了其如何学会适应并信任代理人的合规程度，即使假设的宪法模型与现实不符也能恢复到基准性能水平。 <div>

Abstract: Predicting agents impacted by legal policies, physical limitations, and operational preferences is inherently difficult. In recent years, neuro-symbolic methods have emerged, integrating machine learning and symbolic reasoning models into end-to-end learnable systems. Hereby, a promising avenue for expressing high-level constraints over multi-modal input data in robotics has opened up. This work introduces an approach for Bayesian estimation of agents expected to comply with a human-interpretable neuro-symbolic model we call its Constitution. Hence, we present the Constitutional Filter (CoFi), leading to improved tracking of agents by leveraging expert knowledge, incorporating deep learning architectures, and accounting for environmental uncertainties. CoFi extends the general, recursive Bayesian estimation setting, ensuring compatibility with a vast landscape of established techniques such as Particle Filters. To underpin the advantages of CoFi, we evaluate its performance on real-world marine traffic data. Beyond improved performance, we show how CoFi can learn to trust and adapt to the level of compliance of an agent, recovering baseline performance even if the assumed Constitution clashes with reality.

Abstract: Data harmonization is an essential task that entails integrating datasets from diverse sources. Despite years of research in this area, it remains a time-consuming and challenging task due to schema mismatches, varying terminologies, and differences in data collection methodologies. This paper presents the case for agentic data harmonization as a means to both empower experts to harmonize their data and to streamline the process. We introduce Harmonia, a system that combines LLM-based reasoning, an interactive user interface, and a library of data harmonization primitives to automate the synthesis of data harmonization pipelines. We demonstrate Harmonia in a clinical data harmonization scenario, where it helps to interactively create reusable pipelines that map datasets to a standard format. Finally, we discuss challenges and open problems, and suggest research directions for advancing our vision.

本文介绍了一个从底层向上发展的简单但通用的等级增长模型，该模型考虑了两种动态过程：当局部领导者被选中并被其他代理人跟随时，代理人的晋升到更高层级，以及代理人因降级返回至最低层级。经过初始阶段后，系统逐渐达到一个稳定状态，在此状态下不再出现新的层级，不同层级上的代理人分布呈指数型。在稳定状态下，平均层级水平和位于最低层级的代理人比例与系统大小无关，但层级高度（即观察到的最大层级数）随总的代理人数量以对数方式增长。在稳定状态下，一个代理人的平均跟随者数量远小于其晋升时刻所拥有的跟随者数量。数值模拟结果得到了基于速率方程的理论分析的支持。 <div>

Abstract: The hierarchical topology is a common property of many complex systems. Here we introduce a simple but generic model of hierarchy growth from the bottom to the top. Therein, two dynamical processes are accounted for: agent's promotions to next hierarchy levels when local speakers are elected and followed by other agents and agent's degradations to the lowest hierarchy. Following the initial stage when all agents are at the bottom level in the course of time the system approaches a stationary state where new hierarchies no longer emerge and the distribution of agents at different levels is exponential. In the stationary state the average hierarchy level and the fraction of agents at the lowest level are independent from the system size however the height of hierarchy, i.e. maximal number of observed hierarchy levels grows logarithmically along the total number of agents. The average number of followers of an agent in the stationary state is much smaller than the number of followers he possessed at the promotion moment. Results from numerical simulations are confirmed by an analytical treatment based on the rate equation.

Abstract: Online social networks have dramatically altered the landscape of public discourse, creating both opportunities for enhanced civic participation and risks of deepening social divisions. Prevalent approaches to studying online polarization have been limited by a methodological disconnect: mathematical models excel at formal analysis but lack linguistic realism, while language model-based simulations capture natural discourse but often sacrifice analytical precision. This paper introduces an innovative computational framework that synthesizes these approaches by embedding formal opinion dynamics principles within LLM-based artificial agents, enabling both rigorous mathematical analysis and naturalistic social interactions. We validate our framework through comprehensive offline testing and experimental evaluation with 122 human participants engaging in a controlled social network environment. The results demonstrate our ability to systematically investigate polarization mechanisms while preserving ecological validity. Our findings reveal how polarized environments shape user perceptions and behavior: participants exposed to polarized discussions showed markedly increased sensitivity to emotional content and group affiliations, while perceiving reduced uncertainty in the agents' positions. By combining mathematical precision with natural language capabilities, our framework opens new avenues for investigating social media phenomena through controlled experimentation. This methodological advancement allows researchers to bridge the gap between theoretical models and empirical observations, offering unprecedented opportunities to study the causal mechanisms underlying online opinion dynamics.

Abstract: The scalability of instructable agents in robotics or gaming is often hindered by limited data that pairs instructions with agent trajectories. However, large datasets of unannotated trajectories containing sequences of various agent behaviour (play trajectories) are often available. In a semi-supervised setup, we explore methods to extract labelled segments from play trajectories. The goal is to augment a small annotated dataset of instruction-trajectory pairs to improve the performance of an instruction-following policy trained downstream via imitation learning. Assuming little variation in segment length, recent video segmentation methods can effectively extract labelled segments. To address the constraint of segment length, we propose Play Segmentation (PS), a probabilistic model that finds maximum likely segmentations of extended subsegments, while only being trained on individual instruction segments. Our results in a game environment and a simulated robotic gripper setting underscore the importance of segmentation; randomly sampled segments diminish performance, while incorporating labelled segments from PS improves policy performance to the level of a policy trained on twice the amount of labelled data.

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop (HitL) robot deployment has gained significant attention in both academia and industry as a semi-autonomous paradigm that enables human operators to intervene and adjust robot behaviors at deployment time, improving success rates. However, continuous human monitoring and intervention can be highly labor-intensive and impractical when deploying a large number of robots. To address this limitation, we propose a method that allows diffusion policies to actively seek human assistance only when necessary, reducing reliance on constant human oversight. To achieve this, we leverage the generative process of diffusion policies to compute an uncertainty-based metric based on which the autonomous agent can decide to request operator assistance at deployment time, without requiring any operator interaction during training. Additionally, we show that the same method can be used for efficient data collection for fine-tuning diffusion policies in order to improve their autonomous performance. Experimental results from simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that our approach enhances policy performance during deployment for a variety of scenarios.

Abstract: Thematic analysis of social media posts provides a major understanding of public discourse, yet traditional methods often struggle to capture the complexity and nuance of unstructured, large-scale text data. This study introduces a novel methodology for thematic analysis that integrates tweet embeddings from pre-trained language models, dimensionality reduction using and matrix factorization, and generative AI to identify and refine latent themes. Our approach clusters compressed tweet representations and employs generative AI to extract and articulate themes through an agentic Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, with a secondary LLM for quality assurance. This methodology is applied to tweets from the autistic community, a group that increasingly uses social media to discuss their experiences and challenges. By automating the thematic extraction process, the aim is to uncover key insights while maintaining the richness of the original discourse. This autism case study demonstrates the utility of the proposed approach in improving thematic analysis of social media data, offering a scalable and adaptable framework that can be applied to diverse contexts. The results highlight the potential of combining machine learning and Generative AI to enhance the depth and accuracy of theme identification in online communities.

总结:
本文关注深度强化学习模型在环境观测或任务需求发生微小变化时面临的泛化问题，通常需要昂贵的重训练。为解决这一问题，研究者基于近期的语义对齐工作，提出了一种零样本方法，用于在不同环境下训练的不同智能体之间映射各自的隐空间。该方法学习一种转换，能够在无需进一步微调的情况下，将一个智能体编码器的嵌入向量映射到另一个智能体编码器中。实现这种转换依赖于一组语义上对齐的“锚点”观察数据，用于估计仿射或正交变换。一旦找到转换，针对某一领域的已训练控制器即可零样本地解释来自另一现有编码器的嵌入信息，避免了额外训练。实验表明，该框架在视觉和任务领域转移情况下能保持高性能。文中通过CarRacing环境的变化背景与任务实验证明了零样本拼接性能，为构建更健壮、组合式的动态环境中强化学习铺平道路。 <div>

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) models often fail to generalize when even small changes occur in the environment's observations or task requirements. Addressing these shifts typically requires costly retraining, limiting the reusability of learned policies. In this paper, we build on recent work in semantic alignment to propose a zero-shot method for mapping between latent spaces across different agents trained on different visual and task variations. Specifically, we learn a transformation that maps embeddings from one agent's encoder to another agent's encoder without further fine-tuning. Our approach relies on a small set of "anchor" observations that are semantically aligned, which we use to estimate an affine or orthogonal transform. Once the transformation is found, an existing controller trained for one domain can interpret embeddings from a different (existing) encoder in a zero-shot fashion, skipping additional trainings. We empirically demonstrate that our framework preserves high performance under visual and task domain shifts. We empirically demonstrate zero-shot stitching performance on the CarRacing environment with changing background and task. By allowing modular re-assembly of existing policies, it paves the way for more robust, compositional RL in dynamically changing environments.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents equipped with external tools have become increasingly powerful for handling complex tasks such as web shopping, automated email replies, and financial trading. However, these advancements also amplify the risks of adversarial attacks, particularly when LLM agents can access sensitive external functionalities. Moreover, because LLM agents engage in extensive reasoning or planning before executing final actions, manipulating them into performing targeted malicious actions or invoking specific tools remains a significant challenge. Consequently, directly embedding adversarial strings in malicious instructions or injecting malicious prompts into tool interactions has become less effective against modern LLM agents. In this work, we present UDora, a unified red teaming framework designed for LLM Agents that dynamically leverages the agent's own reasoning processes to compel it toward malicious behavior. Specifically, UDora first samples the model's reasoning for the given task, then automatically identifies multiple optimal positions within these reasoning traces to insert targeted perturbations. Subsequently, it uses the modified reasoning as the objective to optimize the adversarial strings. By iteratively applying this process, the LLM agent will then be induced to undertake designated malicious actions or to invoke specific malicious tools. Our approach demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to existing methods across three LLM agent datasets.

arXiv:2503.01941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents can forget tasks they have previously been trained on. There is a rich body of work on such forgetting effects in humans. Therefore we look for commonalities in the forgetting behavior of humans and RL agents across tasks and test the viability of forgetting prevention measures from learning theory in RL. We find that in many cases, RL agents exhibit forgetting curves similar to those of humans. Methods like Leitner or SuperMemo have been shown to be effective at counteracting human forgetting, but we demonstrate they do not transfer as well to RL. We identify a likely cause: asymmetrical learning and retention patterns between tasks that cannot be captured by retention-based or performance-based curriculum strategies.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the utility functions of agents in a normal-form game by observing the agents play the game repeatedly. Differing from most prior literature, we introduce a principal with the power to observe the agents playing the game, send the agents signals, and send the agents payments as a function of their actions. Under reasonable behavioral models for the agents such as iterated dominated action removal or a no-regret assumption, we show that the principal can, using a number of rounds polynomial in the size of the game, learn the utility functions of all agents to any desirable precision $\varepsilon > 0$. We also show lower bounds in both models, which nearly match the upper bounds in the former model and also strictly separate the two models: the principal can learn strictly faster in the iterated dominance model. Finally, we discuss implications for the problem of steering agents to a desired equilibrium: in particular, we introduce, using our utility-learning algorithm as a subroutine, the first algorithm for steering learning agents without prior knowledge of their utilities.

Abstract: Consider the decision-making setting where agents elect a panel by expressing both positive and negative preferences. Prominently, in constitutional AI, citizens democratically select a slate of ethical preferences on which a foundation model is to be trained. There, in practice, agents may both approve and disapprove of different ethical principles. Proportionality has been well-studied in computational social choice for approval ballots, but its meaning remains unclear when negative sentiments are also considered. In this work, we propose two conceptually distinct approaches to interpret proportionality in the presence of up and down votes. The first approach treats the satisfaction from electing candidates and the impact of vetoing them as comparable, leading to combined proportionality guarantees. The second approach considers veto power separately, introducing guarantees distinct from traditional proportionality. We formalize axioms for each perspective and examine their satisfiability by suitable adaptations of Phragm\'en's rule, Proportional Approval Voting rule and the Method of Equal Shares.

Abstract: Manual curation of evaluation datasets is struggling to keep up with the rapidly expanding capabilities and deployment scenarios of language models. Towards scalable model profiling, we introduce and validate a framework for evaluating LLMs, called Adaptive Evaluations. Adaptive evaluations use scaffolded language models (evaluator agents) to search through a target model's behavior on a domain dataset and create difficult questions (tasks) that can discover and probe the model's failure modes. We find that frontier models lack consistency when adaptively probed with our framework on a diverse suite of datasets and tasks, including but not limited to legal reasoning, forecasting, and online harassment. Generated questions pass human validity checks and often transfer to other models with different capability profiles, demonstrating that adaptive evaluations can also be used to create difficult domain-specific datasets.

总结:<br />
本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在模拟群体心理学特性，特别是信念一致性方面的能力及其对社会互动和偏好形成的影响。研究发现，LLMs在各种情境下展现出比人类更为显著的信念一致性现象。这不仅加剧了误导信息的传播，也阻碍了LLM的学习过程。为缓解这些问题，文章提出了三种策略，分别借鉴接触假说、准确度提示和全球公民框架的理念。实验结果显示，最佳策略可将误导信息传播减少高达37%，并使学习效果提升11%。该研究通过连接社会心理学与人工智能，为现实中使用LLMs处理信念驱动的偏见问题提供了导航性的见解。 <div>

Abstract: Social biases and belief-driven behaviors can significantly impact Large Language Models (LLMs) decisions on several tasks. As LLMs are increasingly used in multi-agent systems for societal simulations, their ability to model fundamental group psychological characteristics remains critical yet under-explored. In this study, we present a multi-agent framework that simulates belief congruence, a classical group psychology theory that plays a crucial role in shaping societal interactions and preferences. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit amplified belief congruence compared to humans, across diverse contexts. We further investigate the implications of this behavior on two downstream tasks: (1) misinformation dissemination and (2) LLM learning, finding that belief congruence in LLMs increases misinformation dissemination and impedes learning. To mitigate these negative impacts, we propose strategies inspired by: (1) contact hypothesis, (2) accuracy nudges, and (3) global citizenship framework. Our results show that the best strategies reduce misinformation dissemination by up to 37% and enhance learning by 11%. Bridging social psychology and AI, our work provides insights to navigate real-world interactions using LLMs while addressing belief-driven biases.

Abstract: Existing challenges in misinformation exposure and susceptibility vary across demographic groups, as some populations are more vulnerable to misinformation than others. Large language models (LLMs) introduce new dimensions to these challenges through their ability to generate persuasive content at scale and reinforcing existing biases. This study investigates the bidirectional persuasion dynamics between LLMs and humans when exposed to misinformative content. We analyze human-to-LLM influence using human-stance datasets and assess LLM-to-human influence by generating LLM-based persuasive arguments. Additionally, we use a multi-agent LLM framework to analyze the spread of misinformation under persuasion among demographic-oriented LLM agents. Our findings show that demographic factors influence susceptibility to misinformation in LLMs, closely reflecting the demographic-based patterns seen in human susceptibility. We also find that, similar to human demographic groups, multi-agent LLMs exhibit echo chamber behavior. This research explores the interplay between humans and LLMs, highlighting demographic differences in the context of misinformation and offering insights for future interventions.

<div> 关键词：安全线性探索博弈、约束满足、乐观主义方法、COLTS框架、计算效率

总结:

本文研究了安全线性探索博弈问题，其中智能体需要在线性约束条件下从凸域中选择动作以最大化未知目标函数。现有的方法主要依赖于基于乐观主义和频数置信区间的策略，这往往导致行动选择过程计算成本高昂。文章提出了一种名为COnstrained Linear Thompson Sampling（COLTS）的采样基础框架，该框架通过利用对未知目标向量和约束矩阵估计值的噪声扰动来有效地平衡后悔最小化与约束满足，从而选择动作。文中介绍了COLTS的三个变体：

1. S-COLTS 假设访问已知的安全动作并确保严格约束执行，通过将COLTS方法与朝向安全动作的重缩放相结合，实现对于$d$维动作下$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 T})$的后悔值和零违规风险。

2. E-COLTS 在斯莱特条件下的软约束执行，结合COLTS和均匀探索，达到$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 T})$的后悔值和风险。

3. R-COLTS 不需要任何侧信息，通过重复采样确保实例无关的后悔值和风险为$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 T})$。

一个关键的技术创新是联合噪声设计，它在保持乐观主义的同时保证了计算效率，并结合一种基于比例分析的技术来处理由采样的约束矩阵引起的每轮可行区域的变化。这些方法与先前方法具有相同的后悔界限，但显著降低了计算成本，从而为约束线性优化的探索博弈提供了一种可扩展且实用的方法。 <div>

Abstract: We study the safe linear bandit problem, where an agent sequentially selects actions from a convex domain to maximize an unknown objective while ensuring unknown linear constraints are satisfied on a per-round basis. Existing approaches primarily rely on optimism-based methods with frequentist confidence bounds, often leading to computationally expensive action selection routines. We propose COnstrained Linear Thompson Sampling (COLTS), a sampling-based framework that efficiently balances regret minimization and constraint satisfaction by selecting actions on the basis of noisy perturbations of the estimates of the unknown objective vector and constraint matrix. We introduce three variants of COLTS, distinguished by the learner's available side information:
  - S-COLTS assumes access to a known safe action and ensures strict constraint enforcement by combining the COLTS approach with a rescaling towards the safe action. For $d$-dimensional actions, this yields $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 T})$ regret and zero constraint violations (or risk).
  - E-COLTS enforces constraints softly under Slater's condition, and attains regret and risk of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 T})$ by combining COLTS with uniform exploration.
  - R-COLTS requires no side information, and ensures instance-independent regret and risk of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 T})$ by leveraging repeated resampling.
  A key technical innovation is a coupled noise design, which maintains optimism while preserving computational efficiency, which is combined with a scaling based analysis technique to address the variation of the per-round feasible region induced by sampled constraint matrices. Our methods match the regret bounds of prior approaches, while significantly reducing computational costs compared to them, thus yielding a scalable and practical approach for constrained bandit linear optimization.

Abstract: Autonomous robots depend crucially on their ability to perceive and process information from dynamic, ever-changing environments. Traditional simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approaches struggle to maintain consistent scene representations because of numerous moving objects, often treating dynamic elements as outliers rather than explicitly modeling them in the scene representation. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical 3D scene graph-based SLAM framework that addresses the challenge of modeling and estimating the pose of dynamic objects and agents. We use fiducial markers to detect dynamic entities and to extract their attributes while improving keyframe selection and implementing new capabilities for dynamic entity mapping. We maintain a hierarchical representation where dynamic objects are registered in the SLAM graph and are constrained with robot keyframes and the floor level of the building with our novel entity-keyframe constraints and intra-entity constraints. By combining semantic and geometric constraints between dynamic entities and the environment, our system jointly optimizes the SLAM graph to estimate the pose of the robot and various dynamic agents and objects while maintaining an accurate map. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves a 27.57% reduction in pose estimation error compared to traditional methods and enables higher-level reasoning about scene dynamics.

Abstract: Pro-environmental behavior (PEB) is vital to combat climate change, yet turning awareness into intention and action remains elusive. We explore large language models (LLMs) as tools to promote PEB, comparing their impact across 3,200 participants: real humans (n=1,200), simulated humans based on actual participant data (n=1,200), and fully synthetic personas (n=1,200). All three participant groups faced personalized or standard chatbots, or static statements, employing four persuasion strategies (moral foundations, future self-continuity, action orientation, or "freestyle" chosen by the LLM). Results reveal a "synthetic persuasion paradox": synthetic and simulated agents significantly affect their post-intervention PEB stance, while human responses barely shift. Simulated participants better approximate human trends but still overestimate effects. This disconnect underscores LLM's potential for pre-evaluating PEB interventions but warns of its limits in predicting real-world behavior. We call for refined synthetic modeling and sustained and extended human trials to align conversational AI's promise with tangible sustainability outcomes.

Abstract: Fully autonomous teams of LLM-powered AI agents are emerging that collaborate to perform complex tasks for users. What challenges do developers face when trying to build and debug these AI agent teams? In formative interviews with five AI agent developers, we identify core challenges: difficulty reviewing long agent conversations to localize errors, lack of support in current tools for interactive debugging, and the need for tool support to iterate on agent configuration. Based on these needs, we developed an interactive multi-agent debugging tool, AGDebugger, with a UI for browsing and sending messages, the ability to edit and reset prior agent messages, and an overview visualization for navigating complex message histories. In a two-part user study with 14 participants, we identify common user strategies for steering agents and highlight the importance of interactive message resets for debugging. Our studies deepen understanding of interfaces for debugging increasingly important agentic workflows.

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a significant challenge, often leading to suboptimal or misaligned behaviors in complex, coordinated environments. We introduce Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning from Multi-phase Human Feedback of Mixed Quality ($\text{M}^3\text{HF}$), a novel framework that integrates multi-phase human feedback of mixed quality into the MARL training process. By involving humans with diverse expertise levels to provide iterative guidance, $\text{M}^3\text{HF}$ leverages both expert and non-expert feedback to continuously refine agents' policies. During training, we strategically pause agent learning for human evaluation, parse feedback using large language models to assign it appropriately and update reward functions through predefined templates and adaptive weight by using weight decay and performance-based adjustments. Our approach enables the integration of nuanced human insights across various levels of quality, enhancing the interpretability and robustness of multi-agent cooperation. Empirical results in challenging environments demonstrate that $\text{M}^3\text{HF}$ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively addressing the complexities of reward design in MARL and enabling broader human participation in the training process.

<div> 关键词：公平分配、在线算法、最大最小份额（MMS）、多类型、随机到达

总结:

本文研究了具有加性估值的$n$个序列化到达的代理之间$m$个不可分割物品的公平分配问题，关注的是最大最小份额（MMS）这一公平性概念。首先指出，在缺乏关于未来代理人估值函数信息的情况下，不存在任何能保证非平凡MMS近似的在线算法，即使只有两个代理也是如此。文章提出了在线$k$-类型公平分配模型，其中每个到达的代理属于$k$种类型之一，同类型的代理具有相同的已知估值函数。针对两种不同的到达模型：
1- 对抗性到达：设计了一个具有$\frac{1}{k}$-MMS竞争比的在线算法，并证明了存在下界，即无法得到$\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}})$-MMS竞争比的算法，即便是对于二元估值也一样。
2- 随机到达：在该模型中，每个到达代理的类型是从潜在的、可能未知的概率分布独立抽取的。与对抗性环境中的依赖于$k$的情况不同，本文展示了在随机环境下，可以实现接近$\frac{1}{2}$-MMS的竞争比，只需对估值函数作出一些轻微的分布假设。此外，当算法能够访问关于估值函数的预测时，文中还表明其竞争比会随着乘性预测误差的增加而平滑下降。 <div>

Abstract: We investigate the problem of fairly allocating $m$ indivisible items among $n$ sequentially arriving agents with additive valuations, under the sought-after fairness notion of maximin share (MMS). We first observe a strong impossibility: without appropriate knowledge about the valuation functions of the incoming agents, no online algorithm can ensure any non-trivial MMS approximation, even when there are only two agents. Motivated by this impossibility, we introduce OnlineKTypeFD (online $k$-type fair division), a model that balances theoretical tractability with real-world applicability. In this model, each arriving agent belongs to one of $k$ types, with all agents of a given type sharing the same known valuation function. We do not constrain $k$ to be a constant. Upon arrival, an agent reveals her type, receives an irrevocable allocation, and departs. We study the ex-post MMS guarantees of online algorithms under two arrival models:
  1- Adversarial arrivals: In this model, an adversary determines the type of each arriving agent. We design a $\frac{1}{k}$-MMS competitive algorithm and complement it with a lower bound, ruling out any $\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}})$-MMS-competitive algorithm, even for binary valuations.
  2- Stochastic arrivals: In this model, the type of each arriving agent is independently drawn from an underlying, possibly unknown distribution. Unlike the adversarial setting where the dependence on $k$ is unavoidable, we surprisingly show that in the stochastic setting, an asymptotic, arbitrarily close-to-$\frac{1}{2}$-MMS competitive guarantee is achievable under mild distributional assumptions.
  Our results extend naturally to a learning-augmented framework; when given access to predictions about valuation functions, we show that the competitive ratios of our algorithms degrade gracefully with multiplicative prediction errors.

这篇论文研究了具有相同估值的同类型代理人对不可分割物品进行公平分配的问题。当仅有一种类型时，总是存在精确的MMS分配方案。但对于两种或更多种类型的代理人，精确的MMS分配不一定存在，因此转向寻找近似MMS分配的存在性。过去十年的研究已得出最佳已知的近似保障为$\frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{3836}$。本文针对具有两类和三类代理人的场景（这在实际场景中常见）改进了近似保证，提出了新的算法，分别为两类代理人提供$\frac{4}{5}$-MMS分配和为三类代理人提供$\frac{16}{21}$-MMS分配。该方法利用多数类型的MMS划分并将其调整以改善所有类型的公平性保障。<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: We study fair division of indivisible goods under the maximin share (MMS) fairness criterion in settings where agents are grouped into a small number of types, with agents within each type having identical valuations. For the special case of a single type, an exact MMS allocation is always guaranteed to exist. However, for two or more distinct agent types, exact MMS allocations do not always exist, shifting the focus to establishing the existence of approximate-MMS allocations. A series of works over the last decade has resulted in the best-known approximation guarantee of $\frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{3836}$.
  In this paper, we improve the approximation guarantees for settings where agents are grouped into two or three types, a scenario that arises in many practical settings. Specifically, we present novel algorithms that guarantee a $\frac{4}{5}$-MMS allocation for two agent types and a $\frac{16}{21}$-MMS allocation for three agent types. Our approach leverages the MMS partition of the majority type and adapts it to provide improved fairness guarantees for all types.

Abstract: Motion planning in navigation systems is highly susceptible to upstream perceptual errors, particularly in human detection and tracking. To mitigate this issue, the concept of guidance points--a novel directional cue within a reinforcement learning-based framework--is introduced. A structured method for identifying guidance points is developed, consisting of obstacle boundary extraction, potential guidance point detection, and redundancy elimination. To integrate guidance points into the navigation pipeline, a perception-to-planning mapping strategy is proposed, unifying guidance points with other perceptual inputs and enabling the RL agent to effectively leverage the complementary relationships among raw laser data, human detection and tracking, and guidance points. Qualitative and quantitative simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the highest success rate and near-optimal travel times, greatly improving both safety and efficiency. Furthermore, real-world experiments in dynamic corridors and lobbies validate the robot's ability to confidently navigate around obstacles and robustly avoid pedestrians.

本文针对交通信号控制问题，提出了一种基于多智能体近端策略优化（MA-PPO）的适应性协调控制算法。研究指出，虽然已有少数尝试将强化学习应用到交通信号控制中的工作，但主要使用了价值基方法，而近期文献表明策略基方法在部分可观测环境中可能表现更优。此外，以往大多数研究对信号定时方案做了简化假设，使得强化学习在实际信号定时计划中的应用尚未得到充分验证。本研究设计的MA-PPO算法采用集中式评论架构，在集中训练和分布式执行框架下运行，允许每个智能体选择并实施最多八个信号相位，符合实际现场控制器的常规实现方式。通过在一个具有七个交叉口、真实完整的交通流、信号相位、交通量以及包括交叉口间距在内的网络几何形状的模拟实证测试走廊上进行测试，结果表明，与当前实施的由Vissim-MaxTime软件建模的协调激活信号控制（ASC）计划相比，提出的MA-PPO自适应控制算法能使整个测试走廊上的两个直行车流旅行时间分别降低约14%和29%。进一步的交通需求变化敏感性实验显示，所提出的MA-PPO算法表现出良好的稳定性、鲁棒性和适应性。 <div>

Abstract: The very few studies that have attempted to formulate multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control have mainly used value-based RL methods although recent literature has shown that policy-based methods may perform better in partially observable environments. Additionally, because of the simplifying assumptions on signal timing made almost universally across previous studies, RL methods remain largely untested for real-world signal timing plans. This study formulates a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO) algorithm to implement adaptive and coordinated traffic control along an arterial corridor. The formulated MA-PPO has centralized critic architecture under the centralized training and decentralized execution framework. All agents are formulated to allow selection and implementation of up to eight signal phases as commonly implemented in the field controllers. The formulated algorithm is tested on a simulated real-world corridor with seven intersections, actual/complete traffic movements and signal phases, traffic volumes, and network geometry including intersection spacings. The performance of the formulated MA-PPO adaptive control algorithm is compared with the field implemented coordinated and actuated signal control (ASC) plans modeled using Vissim-MaxTime software in the loop simulation (SILs). The speed of convergence for each agent largely depended on the size of the action space which in turn depended on the number and sequence of signal phases. Compared with the currently implemented ASC signal timings, MA-PPO showed a travel time reduction of about 14% and 29%, respectively for the two through movements across the entire test corridor. Through volume sensitivity experiments, the formulated MA-PPO showed good stability, robustness and adaptability to changes in traffic demand.

本文提出了一种名为ATLaS的新方法，用于更有效和高效地微调大型语言模型（LLM）代理。现有的LLM代理调优策略通常采用全程监督微调专家轨迹，这可能导致专家偏见并削弱对未被专家数据覆盖状态的泛化能力。ATLaS能够识别专家轨迹中的关键步骤，并仅针对这些步骤对LLMs进行微调，从而以较低的成本减少过拟合整个轨迹的风险并促进跨不同环境和任务的泛化能力。实验表明，仅使用ATLaS选择的30%关键步骤进行微调的LLM性能优于使用全部步骤微调的LLM以及近期开源的LLM代理。同时，ATLaS能够在与多样化环境交互时保持并提升基线LLM作为通用代理的能力。 <div>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across multi-domain tasks. Existing agent tuning approaches typically employ supervised finetuning on entire expert trajectories. However, behavior-cloning of full trajectories can introduce expert bias and weaken generalization to states not covered by the expert data. Additionally, critical steps, such as planning, complex reasoning for intermediate subtasks, and strategic decision-making, are essential to success in agent tasks, so learning these steps is the key to improving LLM agents. For more effective and efficient agent tuning, we propose ATLaS that identifies the critical steps in expert trajectories and finetunes LLMs solely on these steps with reduced costs. By steering the training's focus to a few critical steps, our method mitigates the risk of overfitting entire trajectories and promotes generalization across different environments and tasks. In extensive experiments, an LLM finetuned on only 30% critical steps selected by ATLaS outperforms the LLM finetuned on all steps and recent open-source LLM agents. ATLaS maintains and improves base LLM skills as generalist agents interacting with diverse environments.

Abstract: While Large Language Model-based agents have demonstrated substantial progress in task completion, existing evaluation benchmarks tend to overemphasize single-task performance, with insufficient attention given to the crucial aspects of multitask planning and execution efficiency required in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present Recipe2Plan, a novel benchmark framework based on real-world cooking scenarios. Unlike conventional benchmarks, Recipe2Plan challenges agents to optimize cooking time through parallel task execution while respecting temporal constraints i.e. specific actions need to be performed within a particular time intervals following the preceding steps. Overly aggressive local parallelization may disrupt this constraint, potentially compromising the entire cooking process. This strict time constraint between actions raises a unique challenge for agents to balance between maximizing concurrent operations and adhering to critical timing constraints. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal challenges in maintaining this balance between efficiency and feasibility. The results highlight the need for improved temporal awareness and global multitasking capabilities in large language models. We open-source our benchmark and code at https://github.com/WilliamZR/Recipe2Plan.

总结:
文章介绍了针对对象目标导航(Object Goal Navigation)问题的一种新框架——WMNav，该框架基于视觉语言模型(Vision-Language Models, VLMs)构建了一个世界模型，可以预测决策结果和记忆环境状态。WMNav利用在线维护的好奇心价值图(Curiosity Value Map)来动态配置导航策略，通过比较世界模型计划与实际观察的反馈差异，减少了模型幻觉的影响。此外，为了提高效率，WMNav采用两阶段行动提议者策略，即广泛探索后进行精确定位。实验表明，WMNav在HM3D和MP3D数据集上超越了现有的零样本基准，在成功率和探索效率方面均有显著提升（在HM3D上绝对提升+3.2% SR和+3.2% SPL，在MP3D上绝对提升+13.5% SR和+1.1% SPL）。 <div>

Abstract: Object Goal Navigation-requiring an agent to locate a specific object in an unseen environment-remains a core challenge in embodied AI. Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the development of intelligent LLM-based agents capable of interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). These agents demonstrate strong reasoning and adaptability, enabling them to perform complex tasks that traditionally required predefined rules. However, the reliance on step-by-step reasoning in LLM-based agents often results in inefficiencies, particularly for routine tasks. In contrast, traditional rule-based systems excel in efficiency but lack the intelligence and flexibility to adapt to novel scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel evolutionary framework for GUI agents that enhances operational efficiency while retaining intelligence and flexibility. Our approach incorporates a memory mechanism that records the agent's task execution history. By analyzing this history, the agent identifies repetitive action sequences and evolves high-level actions that act as shortcuts, replacing these low-level operations and improving efficiency. This allows the agent to focus on tasks requiring more complex reasoning, while simplifying routine actions. Experimental results on multiple benchmark tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both efficiency and accuracy. The code will be open-sourced to support further research.

Abstract: Achieving autonomous agents with robust generalization capabilities across diverse games and tasks remains one of the ultimate goals in AI research. Recent advancements in transformer-based offline reinforcement learning, exemplified by the MultiGame Decision Transformer [Lee et al., 2022], have shown remarkable performance across various games or tasks. However, these approaches depend heavily on human expertise, presenting substantial challenges for practical deployment, particularly in scenarios with limited prior game-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called Multi-Game Target Return Optimizer (MTRO) to autonomously determine game-specific target returns within the Multi-Game Decision Transformer framework using solely offline datasets. MTRO addresses the existing limitations by automating the target return configuration process, leveraging environmental reward information extracted from offline datasets. Notably, MTRO does not require additional training, enabling seamless integration into existing Multi-Game Decision Transformer architectures. Our experimental evaluations on Atari games demonstrate that MTRO enhances the performance of RL policies across a wide array of games, underscoring its potential to advance the field of autonomous agent development.

<div> 关键词: 多智能体系统、多部分输出调节问题、合作输出调节问题、二部输出调节问题、分布式控制

<br /><br />总结:

本文提出了一种简单、与图无关的视角来划分图的节点集合，并为多智能体系统（MASs）提供了超越合作和二分的目标。首先，文章引入了$k$-分割变换的概念，以实现对节点集的任意期望划分。接着，利用这一概念定义了异构线性MAS的多部分输出调节问题（MORP），该问题涵盖了现有的合作输出调节问题（CORP）和二部输出调节问题（BORP）作为特例。MORP的目标是设计一个分布式控制律，使得属于同一集合内的每个从属节点能够渐近跟踪预设倍数的参考信号，同时确保闭环系统的内部稳定性。文章证明了MORP的解的存在性和充分必要条件可由CORP得出，并提出了首个基于前馈的分布式控制器参数设计策略，但其存在规模扩展性问题。进一步地，证明了一个较为宽松的结构条件下，该规模扩展性问题的条件可以被其无图依赖的版本所蕴含，这导致了第二个更具可扩展性的设计策略。最后，通过数值例子展示了MORP的普遍性和两个设计策略在规模扩展性方面的比较。 <div>
arXiv:2503.02313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a simple, graph-independent perspective on partitioning the node set of a graph and provides multi-agent systems (MASs) with objectives beyond cooperation and bipartition. Specifically, we first introduce the notion of $k$-partition transformation to achieve any desired partition of the nodes. Then, we use this notion to formulate the multi-partite output regulation problem (MORP) of heterogeneous linear MASs, which comprises the existing cooperative output regulation problem (CORP) and bipartite output regulation problem (BORP) as subcases. The goal of the MORP is to design a distributed control law such that each follower that belongs to the same set in the partition asymptotically tracks a predefined multiple of a reference while ensuring the internal stability of the closed-loop system. It is shown that the necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the MORP with a feedforward-based distributed control law follow from the CORP and lead to the first design strategy for the control parameters. However, it has a drawback in terms of scalability due to a partition-dependent condition. We prove that this condition is implied by its partition-independent version under a mild structural condition. This implication yields the second design strategy that is much more scalable than the first one. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the generality of the MORP and compare both design strategies regarding scalability.

Abstract: We introduce a novel question-answering (QA) dataset using echocardiogram reports sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database. This dataset is specifically designed to enhance QA systems in cardiology, consisting of 771,244 QA pairs addressing a wide array of cardiac abnormalities and their severity. We compare large language models (LLMs), including open-source and biomedical-specific models for zero-shot evaluation, and closed-source models for zero-shot and three-shot evaluation. Our results show that fine-tuning LLMs improves performance across various QA metrics, validating the value of our dataset. Clinicians also qualitatively evaluate the best-performing model to assess the LLM responses for correctness. Further, we conduct fine-grained fairness audits to assess the bias-performance trade-off of LLMs across various social determinants of health. Our objective is to propel the field forward by establishing a benchmark for LLM AI agents aimed at supporting clinicians with cardiac differential diagnoses, thereby reducing the documentation burden that contributes to clinician burnout and enabling healthcare professionals to focus more on patient care.

Abstract: As large language models expand beyond natural language to domains such as mathematics, multimodal understanding, and embodied agents, tokens increasingly reflect metric relationships rather than purely linguistic meaning. We introduce DIST2Loss, a distance-aware framework designed to train autoregressive discrete models by leveraging predefined distance relationships among output tokens. At its core, DIST2Loss transforms continuous exponential family distributions derived from inherent distance metrics into discrete, categorical optimization targets compatible with the models' architectures. This approach enables the models to learn and preserve meaningful distance relationships during token generation while maintaining compatibility with existing architectures. Empirical evaluations show consistent performance gains in diverse multimodal applications, including visual grounding, robotic manipulation, generative reward modeling, and image generation using vector-quantized features. These improvements are pronounced in cases of limited training data, highlighting DIST2Loss's effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Recommendation agents leverage large language models for user modeling LLM UM to construct textual personas guiding alignment with real users. However existing LLM UM methods struggle with long user generated content UGC due to context limitations and performance degradation. To address this sampling strategies prioritize relevance or recency are often applied yet they inevitably neglect the diverse user interests embedded within the discarded behaviors resulting in incomplete modeling and degraded profiling quality. Furthermore relevance based sampling requires real time retrieval forcing the user modeling process to operate online which introduces significant latency overhead. In this paper we propose PersonaX an agent agnostic LLM UM framework that tackles these challenges through sub behavior sequence SBS selection and offline multi persona construction. PersonaX extracts compact SBS segments offline to capture diverse user interests generating fine grained textual personas that are cached for efficient online retrieval. This approach ensures that the user persona used for prompting remains highly relevant to the current context while eliminating the need for online user modeling. For SBS selection we ensure both efficiency length less than five and high representational quality by balancing prototypicality and diversity within the sampled data. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of PersonaX in high quality user profiling. Utilizing only 30 to 50 percent of the behavioral data with a sequence length of 480 integrating PersonaX with AgentCF yields an absolute performance improvement of 3 to 11 percent while integration with Agent4Rec results in a gain of 10 to 50 percent. PersonaX as an agent agnostic framework sets a new benchmark for scalable user modeling paving the way for more accurate and efficient LLM driven recommendation agents.

Abstract: Story visualization is the transformation of narrative elements into image sequences. While existing research has primarily focused on visual contextual coherence, the deeper narrative essence of stories often remains overlooked. This limitation hinders the practical application of these approaches, as generated images frequently fail to capture the intended meaning and nuances of the narrative fully. To address these challenges, we propose VisAgent, a training-free multi-agent framework designed to comprehend and visualize pivotal scenes within a given story. By considering story distillation, semantic consistency, and contextual coherence, VisAgent employs an agentic workflow. In this workflow, multiple specialized agents collaborate to: (i) refine layered prompts based on the narrative structure and (ii) seamlessly integrate \gt{generated} elements, including refined prompts, scene elements, and subject placement, into the final image. The empirically validated effectiveness confirms the framework's suitability for practical story visualization applications.

Abstract: Accurate and systematic evaluation of mobile agents can significantly advance their development and real-world applicability. However, existing benchmarks for mobile agents lack practicality and scalability due to the extensive manual effort required to define task reward signals and implement corresponding evaluation codes. To this end, we propose AutoEval, an autonomous agent evaluation framework that tests a mobile agent without any manual effort. First, we design a Structured Substate Representation to describe the UI state changes while agent execution, such that task reward signals can be automatically generated. Second, we utilize a Judge System that can autonomously evaluate agents' performance given the automatically generated task reward signals. By providing only a task description, our framework evaluates agents with fine-grained performance feedback to that task without any extra manual effort. We implement a prototype of our framework and validate the automatically generated task reward signals, finding over 93% coverage to human-annotated reward signals. Moreover, to prove the effectiveness of our autonomous Judge System, we manually verify its judge results and demonstrate that it achieves 94% accuracy. Finally, we evaluate the state-of-the-art mobile agents using our framework, providing detailed insights into their performance characteristics and limitations.

Abstract: In this paper, the distributed strongly convex optimization problem is studied with spatio-temporal compressed communication and equality constraints. For the case where each agent holds an distributed local equality constraint, a distributed saddle-point algorithm is proposed by employing distributed filters to derive errors of the transmitted states for spatio-temporal compression purposes. It is shown that the resulting distributed compressed algorithm achieves linear convergence. Furthermore, the algorithm is generalized to the case where each agent holds a portion of the global equality constraint, i.e., the constraints across agents are coupled. By introducing an additional design freedom, the global equality constraint is shown to be equivalent to the one where each agent holds an equality constraint, for which the proposed distributed compressed saddle-point algorithm can be adapted to achieve linear convergence. Numerical simulations are adopted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

本文提出了一种新的目标规范方法，旨在实现人类用户在具象环境中指导智能代理互动时具有语义清晰、空间敏感和直观性。该方法创新地采用了一个跨视图目标对齐框架，允许用户通过自身视角的分割掩模来指定目标对象，而无需依赖于智能代理的观察结果。由于单纯的行为克隆无法解决因人与代理视角差异导致的意图对齐问题，文章提出了跨视图一致性损失和目标可见性损失两个辅助目标，以增强智能代理的空间推理能力。基于此，研究者开发出了名为ROCKET-2的最新一代智能代理，在Minecraft中进行了训练，并实现了推理效率提升3至6倍的效果。ROCKET-2成为首个能直接从人类视角解读目标的智能代理，为优化人机交互开辟了新途径。 <div>

Abstract: We aim to develop a goal specification method that is semantically clear, spatially sensitive, and intuitive for human users to guide agent interactions in embodied environments. Specifically, we propose a novel cross-view goal alignment framework that allows users to specify target objects using segmentation masks from their own camera views rather than the agent's observations. We highlight that behavior cloning alone fails to align the agent's behavior with human intent when the human and agent camera views differ significantly. To address this, we introduce two auxiliary objectives: cross-view consistency loss and target visibility loss, which explicitly enhance the agent's spatial reasoning ability. According to this, we develop ROCKET-2, a state-of-the-art agent trained in Minecraft, achieving an improvement in the efficiency of inference 3x to 6x. We show ROCKET-2 can directly interpret goals from human camera views for the first time, paving the way for better human-agent interaction.

<br /><br />总结:
本文提出了一种针对带有记忆的神经多智能体系统(MN-MAS)的验证框架，该框架能对全线性时间逻辑(LTL)规范进行验证。MN-MAS中，智能体与非确定性的部分可观测环境交互，包括基于feed-forward和循环神经网络或状态空间模型的多智能体系统。与先前方法不同的是，该框架支持有限和无限LTL规格说明的验证。研究者利用成熟的有界模型检查技术，如环路搜索和不变量综合，将验证问题简化为约束求解问题。为了解决这些约束，他们开发了基于边界传播、混合整数线性规划和自适应分割的有效方法。实验在Gymnasium和PettingZoo库中的单智能体和多智能体环境中展示了算法的有效性，首次实现了对无限规格说明的验证，并将有限规格说明的验证时间相比现有技术提高了数量级。 <div>

Abstract: We present a framework for verifying Memoryful Neural Multi-Agent Systems (MN-MAS) against full Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specifications. In MN-MAS, agents interact with a non-deterministic, partially observable environment. Examples of MN-MAS include multi-agent systems based on feed-forward and recurrent neural networks or state-space models. Different from previous approaches, we support the verification of both bounded and unbounded LTL specifications. We leverage well-established bounded model checking techniques, including lasso search and invariant synthesis, to reduce the verification problem to that of constraint solving. To solve these constraints, we develop efficient methods based on bound propagation, mixed-integer linear programming, and adaptive splitting. We evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms in single and multi-agent environments from the Gymnasium and PettingZoo libraries, verifying unbounded specifications for the first time and improving the verification time for bounded specifications by an order of magnitude compared to the SoA.

总结:
本文提出了一种针对大型语言模型 (LLM) 代理的新框架——Generator-Assistant Stepwise Rollback (GA-Rollback)，旨在解决传统分步推理框架中因一步一思考导致的不可逆错误传播问题。该框架利用一个生成器与环境交互，而助手负责检查生成器产生的每个动作并触发回滚操作以纠正错误。文章还介绍了两种适用于回滚场景的附加策略，进一步提升其有效性。实验结果显示，GA-Rollback 在三个常用基准测试上显著优于多个强基线。分析表明，GA-Rollback 可作为一个稳健的即插即用模块，能够与其他方法无缝集成。 <div>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically adopt a step-by-step reasoning framework, in which they interleave the processes of thinking and acting to accomplish the given task. However, this paradigm faces a deep-rooted one-pass issue whereby each generated intermediate thought is plugged into the trajectory regardless of its correctness, which can cause irreversible error propagation. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel framework called Generator-Assistant Stepwise Rollback (GA-Rollback) to induce better decision-making for LLM agents. Particularly, GA-Rollback utilizes a generator to interact with the environment and an assistant to examine each action produced by the generator, where the assistant triggers a rollback operation upon detection of incorrect actions. Moreover, we introduce two additional strategies tailored for the rollback scenario to further improve its effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GA-Rollback achieves significant improvements over several strong baselines on three widely used benchmarks. Our analysis further reveals that GA-Rollback can function as a robust plug-and-play module, integrating seamlessly with other methods.

总结:<br />
本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否能够玩游戏以及它们在同时和顺序游戏交互中的随机化与战略适应能力。实验集中在GPT-4o-Mini-2024-08-17上，通过玩Rock Paper Scissors (RPS)和Prisoners Dilemma (PD)两款游戏来考察其性能。结果表明，尽管LLMs常被描述为随机的鹦鹉，但它们在生成“随机”输出时存在显著偏置。在重复游戏中，LLMs展现出损失规避的策略，RPS游戏趋向于僵持状态，而PD游戏则根据提示设计系统性地在合作和竞争之间转变。文章还介绍了独立代理交互的编程工具及实施过程中遇到的Agentic AI挑战。研究表明，虽然LLMs确实可以玩游戏，但表现并不出色，这为多智能体LLM系统中使用LLMs以及当前针对战略决策的模型输出方法的局限性提供了启示。 <div>

Abstract: Playing games has a long history of describing intricate interactions in simplified forms. In this paper we explore if large language models (LLMs) can play games, investigating their capabilities for randomisation and strategic adaptation through both simultaneous and sequential game interactions. We focus on GPT-4o-Mini-2024-08-17 and test two games between LLMs: Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) and games of strategy (Prisoners Dilemma PD). LLMs are often described as stochastic parrots, and while they may indeed be parrots, our results suggest that they are not very stochastic in the sense that their outputs - when prompted to be random - are often very biased. Our research reveals that LLMs appear to develop loss aversion strategies in repeated games, with RPS converging to stalemate conditions while PD shows systematic shifts between cooperative and competitive outcomes based on prompt design. We detail programmatic tools for independent agent interactions and the Agentic AI challenges faced in implementation. We show that LLMs can indeed play games, just not very well. These results have implications for the use of LLMs in multi-agent LLM systems and showcase limitations in current approaches to model output for strategic decision-making.

<div> 关键词: 模糊合同、简洁模糊合同、单结果支付合同、复杂性、算法

<br /><br />总结:
本文探讨了现实世界中具有模糊性的合同问题。研究者们先前证明最优模糊合同可以简化为单结果支付(SOP)合同并能在多项式时间内求解。然而，当限制模糊合同最多只能包含k个经典合同时，这一简化不再成立，使得合同结构和计算变得更复杂。文章提出了一种“移位最小支付合同”的简单分治原则，揭示了最优简洁模糊合同的结构，并基于此设计了一个用于寻找最优简洁模糊合同的算法。对于接近n值的k，该算法是多项式的，但当k为常数或$k=\beta n$（其中$\beta\in(0,1)$）时，算法为指数级，并证明了其在这些问题上的NPC难度。最后，引入了简洁度差距度量来量化由于简洁性带来的损失，并对这个差距提供了上界和下界。特别地，若只缺少一个合同就无法达到无限制情况下的效用，则主体的效用会降低一半，这一结果已被证明是紧致的。 <div>

Abstract: Real-world contracts are often ambiguous. Recent work by D\"utting et al. (EC 2023, Econometrica 2024) models ambiguous contracts as a collection of classic contracts, with the agent choosing an action that maximizes his worst-case utility. In this model, optimal ambiguous contracts have been shown to be ``simple" in that they consist of single-outcome payment (SOP) contracts, and can be computed in polynomial-time. However, this simplicity is challenged by the potential need for many classic contracts. Motivated by this, we explore \emph{succinct} ambiguous contracts, where the ambiguous contract is restricted to consist of at most $k$ classic contracts. Unlike in the unrestricted case, succinct ambiguous contracts are no longer composed solely of SOP contracts, making both their structure and computation more complex.
  We show that, despite this added complexity, optimal succinct ambiguous contracts are governed by a simple divide-and-conquer principle, showing that they consist of ``shifted min-pay contracts" for a suitable partition of the actions. This structural insight implies a characterization of implementability by succinct ambiguous contracts, and can be leveraged to devise an algorithm for the optimal succinct ambiguous contract. While this algorithm is polynomial for $k$ sufficiently close to $n$, for smaller values of $k$, this algorithm is exponential, and we show that this is inevitable (unless P=NP) by establishing NP-hardness for any constant $k$, or $k=\beta n$ for some $\beta\in(0,1)$. Finally, we introduce the succinctness gap measure to quantify the loss incurred due to succinctness, and provide upper and lower bounds on this gap. Interestingly, in the case where we are missing just a single contract from the number sufficient to obtain the utility of the unrestricted case, the principal's utility drops by a factor of $2$, and this is tight.

Abstract: Affordance refers to the functional properties that an agent perceives and utilizes from its environment, and is key perceptual information required for robots to perform actions. This information is rich and multimodal in nature. Existing multimodal affordance methods face limitations in extracting useful information, mainly due to simple structural designs, basic fusion methods, and large model parameters, making it difficult to meet the performance requirements for practical deployment. To address these issues, this paper proposes the BiT-Align image-depth-text affordance mapping framework. The framework includes a Bypass Prompt Module (BPM) and a Text Feature Guidance (TFG) attention selection mechanism. BPM integrates the auxiliary modality depth image directly as a prompt to the primary modality RGB image, embedding it into the primary modality encoder without introducing additional encoders. This reduces the model's parameter count and effectively improves functional region localization accuracy. The TFG mechanism guides the selection and enhancement of attention heads in the image encoder using textual features, improving the understanding of affordance characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant performance improvements on public AGD20K and HICO-IIF datasets. On the AGD20K dataset, compared with the current state-of-the-art method, we achieve a 6.0% improvement in the KLD metric, while reducing model parameters by 88.8%, demonstrating practical application values. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/DAWDSE/BiT-Align.

<br /><br />总结:
本文提出了一种面向人类安全的人工智能驾驶策略——基于约束马尔科夫决策过程（CMDP）和模型预测控制（MPC）的安全强化学习方法，用于解决自动驾驶车辆的并线决策问题。该方法将用户风险偏好纳入安全性约束中，并通过模糊控制方法根据风险偏好与交通密度计算成本限制以调整策略的安全水平。为避免不安全或无效动作，设计了一个预先执行RL动作的动作屏蔽机制，利用MPC进行碰撞检查。理论上证明了屏蔽机制能有效提升RL策略的安全性和样本效率。仿真实验表明，该方法可在保证交通效率的同时显著减少安全隐患。此外，由于在CMDP中使用了风险偏好感知的约束以及在训练阶段即采用动作屏蔽，使得最终策略的安全性可调，同时减少了在线真实环境中学习时的安全违规行为，提供了一种颇具前景的解决方案。 <div>

Abstract: Most reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for the decision-making of autonomous driving consider safety as a reward instead of a cost, which makes it hard to balance the tradeoff between safety and other objectives. Human risk preference has also rarely been incorporated, and the trained policy might be either conservative or aggressive for users. To this end, this study proposes a human-aligned safe RL approach for autonomous merging, in which the high-level decision problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) that incorporates users' risk preference into the safety constraints, followed by a model predictive control (MPC)-based low-level control. The safety level of RL policy can be adjusted by computing cost limits of CMDP's constraints based on risk preferences and traffic density using a fuzzy control method. To filter out unsafe or invalid actions, we design an action shielding mechanism that pre-executes RL actions using an MPC method and performs collision checks with surrounding agents. We also provide theoretical proof to validate the effectiveness of the shielding mechanism in enhancing RL's safety and sample efficiency. Simulation experiments in multiple levels of traffic densities show that our method can significantly reduce safety violations without sacrificing traffic efficiency. Furthermore, due to the use of risk preference-aware constraints in CMDP and action shielding, we can not only adjust the safety level of the final policy but also reduce safety violations during the training stage, proving a promising solution for online learning in real-world environments.

近期，大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步促使基于LLM的代理能够在互动规划任务中取得成功。然而，现有的方法常常遭受计划幻觉问题困扰，并且针对每个新代理都需要重新训练。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了元计划优化（MPO）框架，该框架通过直接整合显式的指导来增强代理的规划能力。与依赖需要大量人力或质量无法保证的复杂知识的方法不同，MPO利用高层次的通用指导——即元计划来辅助代理规划，并根据代理执行任务的反馈对元计划进行持续优化。实验结果表明，MPO在两个代表性任务上显著优于现有基线。此外，分析显示MPO提供了一个即插即用的解决方案，能够提升任务完成效率以及在未见过的新场景中的泛化能力。 <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based agents to successfully tackle interactive planning tasks. However, despite their successes, existing approaches often suffer from planning hallucinations and require retraining for each new agent. To address these challenges, we propose the Meta Plan Optimization (MPO) framework, which enhances agent planning capabilities by directly incorporating explicit guidance. Unlike previous methods that rely on complex knowledge, which either require significant human effort or lack quality assurance, MPO leverages high-level general guidance through meta plans to assist agent planning and enables continuous optimization of the meta plans based on feedback from the agent's task execution. Our experiments conducted on two representative tasks demonstrate that MPO significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, our analysis indicates that MPO provides a plug-and-play solution that enhances both task completion efficiency and generalization capabilities in previous unseen scenarios.

Abstract: To improve stock trend predictions and support personalized investment decisions, this paper proposes FinArena, a novel Human-Agent collaboration framework. Inspired by the mixture of experts (MoE) approach, FinArena combines multimodal financial data analysis with user interaction. The human module features an interactive interface that captures individual risk preferences, allowing personalized investment strategies. The machine module utilizes a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) multi-agent system to integrate diverse data sources, such as stock prices, news articles, and financial statements. To address hallucinations in LLMs, FinArena employs the adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generative (RAG) method for processing unstructured news data. Finally, a universal expert agent makes investment decisions based on the features extracted from multimodal data and investors' individual risk preferences. Extensive experiments show that FinArena surpasses both traditional and state-of-the-art benchmarks in stock trend prediction and yields promising results in trading simulations across various risk profiles. These findings highlight FinArena's potential to enhance investment outcomes by aligning strategic insights with personalized risk considerations.

Abstract: Feedforward control (FF) is often combined with feedback control (FB) in many control systems, improving tracking performance, efficiency, and stability. However, designing effective data-driven FF controllers in multi-agent systems requires significant data collection, including transferring private or proprietary data, which raises privacy concerns and incurs high communication costs. Therefore, we propose a novel approach integrating Federated Learning (FL) into FF control to address these challenges. This approach enables privacy-preserving, communication-efficient, and decentralized continuous improvement of FF controllers across multiple agents without sharing personal or proprietary data. By leveraging FL, each agent learns a local, neural FF controller using its data and contributes only model updates to a global aggregation process, ensuring data privacy and scalability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in an autonomous driving use case. Therein, vehicles equipped with a trajectory-tracking feedback controller are enhanced by FL-based neural FF control. Simulations highlight significant improvements in tracking performance compared to pure FB control, analogous to model-based FF control. We achieve comparable tracking performance without exchanging private vehicle-specific data compared to a centralized neural FF control. Our results underscore the potential of FL-based neural FF control to enable privacy-preserving learning in multi-agent control systems, paving the way for scalable and efficient autonomous systems applications.

Abstract: Metaphorical expressions are abundant in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), conveying complex disease mechanisms and holistic health concepts through culturally rich and often abstract terminology. Bridging these metaphors to anatomically driven Western medical (WM) concepts poses significant challenges for both automated language processing and real-world clinical practice. To address this gap, we propose a novel multi-agent and chain-of-thought (CoT) framework designed to interpret TCM metaphors accurately and map them to WM pathophysiology. Specifically, our approach combines domain-specialized agents (TCM Expert, WM Expert) with a Coordinator Agent, leveraging stepwise chain-of-thought prompts to ensure transparent reasoning and conflict resolution. We detail a methodology for building a metaphor-rich TCM dataset, discuss strategies for effectively integrating multi-agent collaboration and CoT reasoning, and articulate the theoretical underpinnings that guide metaphor interpretation across distinct medical paradigms. We present a comprehensive system design and highlight both the potential benefits and limitations of our approach, while leaving placeholders for future experimental validation. Our work aims to support clinical decision-making, cross-system educational initiatives, and integrated healthcare research, ultimately offering a robust scaffold for reconciling TCM's symbolic language with the mechanistic focus of Western medicine.

Abstract: Cyber resilience is the ability of a system to recover from an attack with minimal impact on system operations. However, characterizing a network's resilience under a cyber attack is challenging, as there are no formal definitions of resilience applicable to diverse network topologies and attack patterns. In this work, we propose a quantifiable formulation of resilience that considers multiple defender operational goals, the criticality of various network resources for daily operations, and provides interpretability to security operators about their system's resilience under attack. We evaluate our approach within the CybORG environment, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for autonomous cyber defense, analyzing trade-offs between resilience, costs, and prioritization of operational goals. Furthermore, we introduce methods to aggregate resilience metrics across time-variable attack patterns and multiple network topologies, comprehensively characterizing system resilience. Using insights gained from our resilience metrics, we design RL autonomous defensive agents and compare them against several heuristic baselines, showing that proactive network hardening techniques and prompt recovery of compromised machines are critical for effective cyber defenses.

Tracking dataset provenance, verifying redistribution rights, and assessing evolving legal risks across multiple stages require a level of precision and efficiency that exceeds human capabilities. Addressing this challenge effectively demands AI agents that can systematically trace dataset redistribution, analyze compliance, and identify legal risks. We develop an automated data compliance system called NEXUS and show that AI can perform these tasks with higher accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness than human experts. Our massive legal analysis of 17,429 unique entities and 8,072 license terms using this approach reveals the discrepancies in legal rights between the original datasets before redistribution and their redistributed subsets, underscoring the necessity of the data lifecycle-aware compliance. For instance, we find that out of 2,852 datasets with commercially viable individual license terms, only 605 (21%) are legally permissible for commercialization. This work sets a new standard for AI data governance, advocating for a framework that systematically examines the entire lifecycle of dataset redistribution to ensure transparent, legal, and responsible dataset management.

Abstract: Exploration algorithms for reinforcement learning typically replace or augment the reward function with an additional ``intrinsic'' reward that trains the agent to seek previously unseen states of the environment. Here, we consider an exploration algorithm that exploits meta-learning, or learning to learn, such that the agent learns to maximize its exploration progress within a single episode, even between epochs of training. The agent learns a policy that aims to minimize the probability density of new observations with respect to all of its memories. In addition, it receives as feedback evaluations of the current observation density and retains that feedback in a recurrent network. By remembering trajectories of density, the agent learns to navigate a complex and growing landscape of familiarity in real-time, allowing it to maximize its exploration progress even in completely novel states of the environment for which its policy has not been trained.

Abstract: Current embodied reasoning agents struggle to plan for long-horizon tasks that require to physically interact with the world to obtain the necessary information (e.g. 'sort the objects from lightest to heaviest'). The improvement of the capabilities of such an agent is highly dependent on the availability of relevant training environments. In order to facilitate the development of such systems, we introduce a novel simulation environment (built on top of robosuite) that makes use of the MuJoCo physics engine and high-quality renderer Blender to provide realistic visual observations that are also accurate to the physical state of the scene. It is the first simulator focusing on long-horizon robot manipulation tasks preserving accurate physics modeling. MuBlE can generate mutlimodal data for training and enable design of closed-loop methods through environment interaction on two levels: visual - action loop, and control - physics loop. Together with the simulator, we propose SHOP-VRB2, a new benchmark composed of 10 classes of multi-step reasoning scenarios that require simultaneous visual and physical measurements.

Abstract: This work is concerned with the finite-horizon optimal covariance steering of networked systems governed by discrete-time stochastic linear dynamics. In contrast with existing work that has only considered systems with dynamically decoupled agents, we consider a dynamically coupled system composed of interconnected subsystems subject to local communication constraints. In particular, we propose a distributed algorithm to compute the localized optimal feedback control policy for each individual subsystem, which depends only on the local state histories of its neighboring subsystems. Utilizing the system-level synthesis (SLS) framework, we first recast the localized covariance steering problem as a convex SLS problem with locality constraints. Subsequently, exploiting its partially separable structure, we decompose the latter problem into smaller subproblems, introducing a transformation to deal with nonseparable instances. Finally, we employ a variation of the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to distribute computation across subsystems on account of their local information and communication constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm on a power system with 36 interconnected subsystems.

本文提出了使用分布式事实核查器（代理人）来解决假新闻检测问题的方法。文章将新闻流建模为独立同分布的二元源，表示真实的真伪状态。每个代理人观察到一则新闻后，会以概率 $1-\pi_i$ 标记其为真实或虚假，其中 $\pi_i \in (0,1)$ 表示第 $i$ 个代理人的不可靠程度，即误分类的概率。文中提出了一种算法来学习这些不可靠参数，从而形成一种分布式事实核查算法。此外，文章还对算法的离散时间极限进行了深入分析。 <div>

Abstract: We formulate the problem of fake news detection using distributed fact-checkers (agents) with unknown reliability. The stream of news/statements is modeled as an independent and identically distributed binary source (to represent true and false statements). Upon observing a news, agent $i$ labels the news as true or false which reflects the true validity of the statement with some probability $1-\pi_i$. In other words, agent $i$ misclassified each statement with error probability $\pi_i\in (0,1)$, where the parameter $\pi_i$ models the (un)trustworthiness of agent $i$. We present an algorithm to learn the unreliability parameters, resulting in a distributed fact-checking algorithm. Furthermore, we extensively analyze the discrete-time limit of our algorithm.

arXiv:2503.02437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of allocating heterogeneous resources among multiple agents in a decentralized manner. Our proposed method, LGTC-IPPO, builds upon Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) by integrating dynamic cluster consensus, a mechanism that allows agents to form and adapt local sub-teams based on resource demands. This decentralized coordination strategy reduces reliance on global information and enhances scalability. We evaluate LGTC-IPPO against standard multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines and a centralized expert solution across a range of team sizes and resource distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that LGTC-IPPO achieves more stable rewards, better coordination, and robust performance even as the number of agents or resource types increases. Additionally, we illustrate how dynamic clustering enables agents to reallocate resources efficiently also for scenarios with discharging resources.

Abstract: As a data-driven approach, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made remarkable advances in solving cooperative residential load scheduling problems. However, centralized training, the most common paradigm for MARL, limits large-scale deployment in communication-constrained cloud-edge environments. As a remedy, distributed training shows unparalleled advantages in real-world applications but still faces challenge with system scalability, e.g., the high cost of communication overhead during coordinating individual agents, and needs to comply with data governance in terms of privacy. In this work, we propose a novel MARL solution to address these two practical issues. Our proposed approach is based on actor-critic methods, where the global critic is a learned function of individual critics computed solely based on local observations of households. This scheme preserves household privacy completely and significantly reduces communication cost. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art actor-critic framework without data governance and communication constraints.

Abstract: While achieving tremendous success in various fields, existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with a black-box neural network makes decisions in an opaque manner that hinders humans from understanding the learned knowledge and how input observations influence decisions. In contrast, existing interpretable approaches usually suffer from weak expressivity and low performance. To bridge this gap, we propose MIXing Recurrent soft decision Trees (MIXRTs), a novel interpretable architecture that can represent explicit decision processes via the root-to-leaf path and reflect each agent's contribution to the team. Specifically, we construct a novel soft decision tree using a recurrent structure and demonstrate which features influence the decision-making process. Then, based on the value decomposition framework, we linearly assign credit to each agent by explicitly mixing individual action values to estimate the joint action value using only local observations, providing new insights into interpreting the cooperation mechanism. Theoretical analysis confirms that MIXRTs guarantee additivity and monotonicity in the factorization of joint action values. Evaluations on complex tasks like Spread and StarCraft II demonstrate that MIXRTs compete with existing methods while providing clear explanations, paving the way for interpretable and high-performing MARL systems.

Abstract: We consider a hidden-action principal-agent model, in which actions require different amounts of effort, and the agent privately knows his ability that determines his cost of effort. We show that linear contracts admit approximation guarantees that improve with a natural metric that captures the degree of uncertainty in the contracting setting. We thus show that linear contracts are near-optimal whenever there is enough uncertainty. In contrast, other simple contract formats such as debt contracts may suffer from a loss linear in the number of possible actions, even when there is sufficient uncertainty.

Abstract: We study the problem of repeated two-sided matching with uncertain preferences (two-sided bandits), and no explicit communication between agents. Recent work has developed algorithms that converge to stable matchings when one side (the proposers or agents) must learn their preferences, but the preferences of the other side (the proposees or arms) are common knowledge, and the matching mechanism uses simultaneous proposals at each round. We develop new algorithms that provably converge to stable matchings for two more challenging settings: one where the arm preferences are no longer common knowledge, and a second, more general one where the arms are also uncertain about their preferences. In our algorithms, agents start with optimistic beliefs about arms' preferences and update these preferences over time. The key insight is in how to combine these beliefs about arm preferences with beliefs about the value of matching with an arm conditional on one's proposal being accepted when choosing whom to propose to.

Abstract: The vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks has been attracting considerable attention in recent years. Most existing studies focus on the behavior of stand-alone single-agent learners. In comparison, this work studies adversarial training over graphs, where individual agents are subjected to perturbations of varied strength levels across space. It is expected that interactions by linked agents, and the heterogeneity of the attack models that are possible over the graph, can help enhance robustness in view of the coordination power of the group. Using a min-max formulation of distributed learning, we develop a decentralized adversarial training framework for multi-agent systems. Specifically, we devise two decentralized adversarial training algorithms by relying on two popular decentralized learning strategies--diffusion and consensus. We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed framework for strongly-convex, convex, and non-convex environments, and illustrate the enhanced robustness to adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Argumentation is a very active research field of Artificial Intelligence concerned with the representation and evaluation of arguments used in dialogues between humans and/or artificial agents. Acceptability semantics of formal argumentation systems define the criteria for the acceptance or rejection of arguments. Several software systems, known as argumentation solvers, have been developed to compute the accepted/rejected arguments using such criteria. These include systems that learn to identify the accepted arguments using non-interpretable methods. In this paper we present a novel framework, which uses an Inductive Logic Programming approach to learn the acceptability semantics for several abstract and structured argumentation frameworks in an interpretable way. Through an empirical evaluation we show that our framework outperforms existing argumentation solvers, thus opening up new future research directions in the area of formal argumentation and human-machine dialogues.

Abstract: A thorough understanding of the interaction between the target agent and surrounding agents is a prerequisite for accurate trajectory prediction. Although many methods have been explored, they assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and replaces the attention scores in Transformer with a newly computed physical correlation coefficient, enhancing the interpretability of interaction modeling. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

总结:

本文研究了子加性估值下的公平与效率之间的兼容性。针对子加性估值，文章证明存在一种部分分配方案，该方案满足-envy-free up to any good (EFx)且Nash 社会福利（NSW）至少为最优值的一半。同时，对于子加性估值，文章解决了Garg等人（STOC 2023）提出的开放问题，证明了普遍存在一种完整分配方案，既能满足envy-free up to one good (EF1)，又能实现对最优NSW的1/2近似比。此外，文章提出了一种多项式时间算法，输入任意分配方案$\widetilde{A}$后，可以返回一个EF1分配方案，其NSW至少达到$\widetilde{A}$的$\frac{1}{e^{2/e}}\approx \frac{1}{2.08}$倍。这意味着对于子加性估值，可以在多项式时间内（带需求查询）同时实现EF1准则和对最优NSW的常数因子近似。文章进一步指出，虽然EF1和精确帕累托效率（PO）在子加性估值下不兼容，但只需考虑1/2近似，则可以实现EF1与1/2-PO的兼容。因此，本文的结果提供了一个通用工具，能够将任何有效结果转换为公平结果，同时仅使效率轻微降低。 <div>

Abstract: We establish a compatibility between fairness and efficiency, captured via Nash Social Welfare (NSW), under the broad class of subadditive valuations. We prove that, for subadditive valuations, there always exists a partial allocation that is envy-free up to the removal of any good (EFx) and has NSW at least half of the optimal; here, optimality is considered across all allocations, fair or otherwise. We also prove, for subadditive valuations, the universal existence of complete allocations that are envy-free up to one good (EF1) and also achieve a factor $1/2$ approximation to the optimal NSW. Our EF1 result resolves an open question posed by Garg, Husic, Li, V\'{e}gh, and Vondr\'{a}k (STOC 2023).
  In addition, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm which, given an arbitrary allocation $\widetilde{A}$ as input, returns an EF1 allocation with NSW at least $\frac{1}{e^{2/e}}\approx \frac{1}{2.08}$ times that of $\widetilde{A}$. Therefore, our results imply that the EF1 criterion can be attained simultaneously with a constant-factor approximation to optimal NSW in polynomial time (with demand queries), for subadditive valuations. The previously best-known approximation factor for optimal NSW, under EF1 and among $n$ agents, was $O(n)$ -- we improve this bound to $O(1)$.
  It is known that EF1 and exact Pareto efficiency (PO) are incompatible with subadditive valuations. Complementary to this negative result, the current work shows that we regain compatibility by just considering a factor $1/2$ approximation: EF1 can be achieved in conjunction with $\frac{1}{2}$-PO under subadditive valuations. As such, our results serve as a general tool that can be used as a black box to convert any efficient outcome into a fair one, with only a marginal decrease in efficiency.

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide a structured framework for decision-making under uncertainty, but their application requires efficient belief updates. Sequential Importance Resampling Particle Filters (SIRPF), also known as Bootstrap Particle Filters, are commonly used as belief updaters in large approximate POMDP solvers, but they face challenges such as particle deprivation and high computational costs as the system's state dimension grows. To address these issues, this study introduces Rao-Blackwellized POMDP (RB-POMDP) approximate solvers and outlines generic methods to apply Rao-Blackwellization in both belief updates and online planning. We compare the performance of SIRPF and Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters (RBPF) in a simulated localization problem where an agent navigates toward a target in a GPS-denied environment using POMCPOW and RB-POMCPOW planners. Our results not only confirm that RBPFs maintain accurate belief approximations over time with fewer particles, but, more surprisingly, RBPFs combined with quadrature-based integration improve planning quality significantly compared to SIRPF-based planning under the same computational limits.

总结:<br />
在高维开放世界的视觉强化学习中，训练智能体面临重大挑战。本文提出了LS-Imagine方法，旨在解决长期探索效率问题，特别是对于需要考虑长时段回报的任务。该方法通过构建“长短期世界模型”，延长了想象中的行为序列长度，允许智能体在有限的步数内探索可能导致长远反馈的行为。具体实现上，LS-Imagine利用目标条件下的跳跃状态转移模拟和单幅图像内的特定区域放大来计算相应的可操作性地图，进而将直接的长期价值整合到行为学习中。实验表明，LS-Imagine相较于当前最先进的技术在MineDojo场景中表现出显著优势。 <div>

Abstract: Training visual reinforcement learning agents in a high-dimensional open world presents significant challenges. While various model-based methods have improved sample efficiency by learning interactive world models, these agents tend to be "short-sighted", as they are typically trained on short snippets of imagined experiences. We argue that the primary challenge in open-world decision-making is improving the exploration efficiency across a vast state space, especially for tasks that demand consideration of long-horizon payoffs. In this paper, we present LS-Imagine, which extends the imagination horizon within a limited number of state transition steps, enabling the agent to explore behaviors that potentially lead to promising long-term feedback. The foundation of our approach is to build a $\textit{long short-term world model}$. To achieve this, we simulate goal-conditioned jumpy state transitions and compute corresponding affordance maps by zooming in on specific areas within single images. This facilitates the integration of direct long-term values into behavior learning. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art techniques in MineDojo.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative to training task-specific dialog agents, due to their broad reasoning capabilities and performance in zero-shot learning scenarios. However, many LLM-based dialog systems fall short in planning towards an overarching dialog goal and therefore cannot steer the conversation appropriately. Furthermore, these models struggle with hallucination, making them unsuitable for information access in sensitive domains, such as legal or medical domains, where correctness of information given to users is critical. The recently introduced task Conversational Tree Search (CTS) proposes the use of dialog graphs to avoid hallucination in sensitive domains, however, state-of-the-art agents are Reinforcement Learning (RL) based and require long training times, despite excelling at dialog strategy. This paper introduces a novel zero-shot method for controllable CTS agents, where LLMs guide the dialog planning through domain graphs by searching and pruning relevant graph nodes based on user interaction preferences. We show that these agents significantly outperform state-of-the-art CTS agents ($p<0.0001$; Barnard Exact test) in simulation. This generalizes to all available CTS domains. Finally, we perform user evaluation to test the agent's performance in the wild, showing that our policy significantly ($p<0.05$; Barnard Exact) improves task-success compared to the state-of-the-art RL-based CTS agent.

Abstract: Event extraction has gained extensive research attention due to its broad range of applications. However, the current mainstream evaluation method for event extraction relies on token-level exact match, which misjudges numerous semantic-level correct cases. This reliance leads to a significant discrepancy between the evaluated performance of models under exact match criteria and their real performance. To address this problem, we propose a reliable and semantic evaluation framework for event extraction, named RAEE, which accurately assesses extraction results at semantic-level instead of token-level. Specifically, RAEE leverages large language models (LLMs) as evaluation agents, incorporating an adaptive mechanism to achieve adaptive evaluations for precision and recall of triggers and arguments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) RAEE achieves a very strong correlation with human judgments; (2) after reassessing 14 models, including advanced LLMs, on 10 datasets, there is a significant performance gap between exact match and RAEE. The exact match evaluation significantly underestimates the performance of existing event extraction models, and in particular underestimates the capabilities of LLMs; (3) fine-grained analysis under RAEE evaluation reveals insightful phenomena worth further exploration. The evaluation toolkit of our proposed RAEE is publicly released.

<div> 关键词：Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)，Large Language Models (LLMs)，Differentiable Data Rewards (DDR)，Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)，End-to-End训练

总结:
本文提出了一种名为Differentiable Data Rewards (DDR)的方法，用于改进Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)系统中大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识利用能力。现有的方法通过监督微调（SFT）优化LLMs以适应RAG任务，但容易导致过拟合训练信号并忽视了RAG系统内部模块间的数据偏好差异。DDR方法采用端到端训练方式，通过rollout方法使RAG系统的各模块之间数据偏好对齐，从而收集奖励并优化每个模块。实验表明，DDR方法在各种知识密集型任务上显著优于SFT方法，特别是在依赖检索知识的小规模参数的LLMs上效果更优。此外，DDR还展现出更好地对齐RAG模块间数据偏好的能力，使得生成模块能更有效地从文档中提取关键信息并减少参数记忆与外部知识之间的冲突。相关代码已发布在https://github.com/OpenMatch/RAG-DDR。 <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving knowledge from external resources. To adapt LLMs for the RAG systems, current approaches use instruction tuning to optimize LLMs, improving their ability to utilize retrieved knowledge. This supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach focuses on equipping LLMs to handle diverse RAG tasks using different instructions. However, it trains RAG modules to overfit training signals and overlooks the varying data preferences among agents within the RAG system. In this paper, we propose a Differentiable Data Rewards (DDR) method, which end-to-end trains RAG systems by aligning data preferences between different RAG modules. DDR works by collecting the rewards to optimize each agent in the RAG system with the rollout method, which prompts agents to sample some potential responses as perturbations, evaluates the impact of these perturbations on the whole RAG system, and subsequently optimizes the agent to produce outputs that improve the performance of the RAG system. Our experiments on various knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate that DDR significantly outperforms the SFT method, particularly for LLMs with smaller-scale parameters that depend more on the retrieved knowledge. Additionally, DDR exhibits a stronger capability to align the data preference between RAG modules. The DDR method makes the generation module more effective in extracting key information from documents and mitigating conflicts between parametric memory and external knowledge.

Abstract: Deformable object manipulation remains a key challenge in developing autonomous robotic systems that can be successfully deployed in real-world scenarios. In this work, we explore the challenges of deformable object manipulation through the task of sculpting clay into 3D shapes. We propose the first coarse-to-fine autonomous sculpting system in which the sculpting agent first selects how many and where to place discrete chunks of clay into the workspace to create a coarse shape, and then iteratively refines the shape with sequences of deformation actions. We leverage large language models for sub-goal generation, and train a point cloud region-based action model to predict robot actions from the desired point cloud sub-goals. Additionally, our method is the first autonomous sculpting system that is a real-world text-to-3D shaping pipeline without any explicit 3D goals or sub-goals provided to the system. We demonstrate our method is able to successfully create a set of simple shapes solely from text-based prompting. Furthermore, we explore rigorously how to best quantify success for the text-to-3D sculpting task, and compare existing text-image and text-point cloud similarity metrics to human evaluations for this task.

Abstract: Desires motivate humans to interact autonomously with the complex world. In contrast, current AI agents require explicit task specifications, such as instructions or reward functions, which constrain their autonomy and behavioral diversity. In this paper, we introduce a Desire-driven Autonomous Agent (D2A) that can enable a large language model (LLM) to autonomously propose and select tasks, motivated by satisfying its multi-dimensional desires. Specifically, the motivational framework of D2A is mainly constructed by a dynamic Value System, inspired by the Theory of Needs. It incorporates an understanding of human-like desires, such as the need for social interaction, personal fulfillment, and self-care. At each step, the agent evaluates the value of its current state, proposes a set of candidate activities, and selects the one that best aligns with its intrinsic motivations. We conduct experiments on Concordia, a text-based simulator, to demonstrate that our agent generates coherent, contextually relevant daily activities while exhibiting variability and adaptability similar to human behavior. A comparative analysis with other LLM-based agents demonstrates that our approach significantly enhances the rationality of the simulated activities.

Abstract: Surveys and interviews are widely used for collecting insights on emerging or hypothetical scenarios. Traditional human-led methods often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and consistency. Recently, various domains have begun to explore the use of conversational agents (chatbots) powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, considering decisions in transportation investments and policies often carry significant public and environmental stakes, surveys and interviews face unique challenges in integrating AI agents, underscoring the need for a rigorous, resource-efficient approach that enhances participant engagement and ensures privacy. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a modular approach and its resulting parameterized process for designing AI agents. We detail the system architecture, integrating engineered prompts, specialized knowledge bases, and customizable, goal-oriented conversational logic. We demonstrate the adaptability, generalizability, and efficacy of our modular approach through three empirical studies: (1) travel preference surveys, highlighting conditional logic and multimodal (voice, text, and image generation) capabilities; (2) public opinion elicitation on a newly constructed, novel infrastructure project, showcasing question customization and multilingual (English and French) capabilities; and (3) expert consultation about the impact of technologies on future transportation systems, highlighting real-time, clarification request capabilities for open-ended questions, resilience in handling erratic inputs, and efficient transcript postprocessing. The results suggest that the AI agent increases completion rates and response quality. Furthermore, the modular approach demonstrates controllability, flexibility, and robustness while addressing key ethical, privacy, security, and token consumption concerns.

Abstract: Today, several people and organizations rely on cloud platforms. The reliability of cloud platforms depends heavily on the performance of their internal programs (agents). To better prevent regressions in cloud platforms, the design of pre-production testing environments (that test new agents, new hardwares, and other changes) must take into account the diversity of server/node properties (hardware model, virtual machine type, etc.) across the fleet and dynamically emphasize or de-emphasize the prevalence of certain node properties based on current testing priorities. This paper formulates this task as the "environment design" problem and presents the EnvDesign model, a method that uses graph theory and optimization algorithms to solve the environment design problem. The EnvDesign model was built on context and techniques that apply to combinatorial testing in general, so it can support combinatorial testing in other domains.

Abstract: As REST APIs have become widespread in modern web services, comprehensive testing of these APIs is increasingly crucial. Because of the vast search space of operations, parameters, and parameter values, along with their dependencies and constraints, current testing tools often achieve low code coverage, resulting in suboptimal fault detection. To address this limitation, we present AutoRestTest, a novel tool that integrates the Semantic Property Dependency Graph (SPDG) with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and large language models (LLMs) for effective REST API testing. AutoRestTest determines operation-dependent parameters using the SPDG and employs five specialized agents (operation, parameter, value, dependency, and header) to identify dependencies of operations and generate operation sequences, parameter combinations, and values. Through an intuitive command-line interface, users can easily configure and monitor tests with successful operation count, unique server errors detected, and time elapsed. Upon completion, AutoRestTest generates a detailed report highlighting errors detected and operations exercised. In this paper, we introduce our tool and present preliminary findings, with a demonstration video available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVus2W8rap8.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in healthcare applications. However, their deployment in clinical practice raises significant safety concerns, including the potential spread of harmful information. This study systematically assesses the vulnerabilities of seven LLMs to three advanced black-box jailbreaking techniques within medical contexts. To quantify the effectiveness of these techniques, we propose an automated and domain-adapted agentic evaluation pipeline. Experiment results indicate that leading commercial and open-source LLMs are highly vulnerable to medical jailbreaking attacks. To bolster model safety and reliability, we further investigate the effectiveness of Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT) in defending against medical adversarial attacks. Our findings underscore the necessity for evolving attack methods evaluation, domain-specific safety alignment, and LLM safety-utility balancing. This research offers actionable insights for advancing the safety and reliability of AI clinicians, contributing to ethical and effective AI deployment in healthcare.

Abstract: Control policies that can achieve high task performance and satisfy safety constraints are desirable for any system, including multi-agent systems (MAS). One promising technique for ensuring the safety of MAS is distributed control barrier functions (CBF). However, it is difficult to design distributed CBF-based policies for MAS that can tackle unknown discrete-time dynamics, partial observability, changing neighborhoods, and input constraints, especially when a distributed high-performance nominal policy that can achieve the task is unavailable. To tackle these challenges, we propose DGPPO, a new framework that simultaneously learns both a discrete graph CBF which handles neighborhood changes and input constraints, and a distributed high-performance safe policy for MAS with unknown discrete-time dynamics. We empirically validate our claims on a suite of multi-agent tasks spanning three different simulation engines. The results suggest that, compared with existing methods, our DGPPO framework obtains policies that achieve high task performance (matching baselines that ignore the safety constraints), and high safety rates (matching the most conservative baselines), with a constant set of hyperparameters across all environments.

Abstract: Online restless bandits extend classic contextual bandits by incorporating state transitions and budget constraints, representing each agent as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This framework is crucial for finite-horizon strategic resource allocation, optimizing limited costly interventions for long-term benefits. However, learning the underlying MDP for each agent poses a major challenge in finite-horizon settings. To facilitate learning, we reformulate the problem as a scalable budgeted thresholding contextual bandit problem, carefully integrating the state transitions into the reward design and focusing on identifying agents with action benefits exceeding a threshold. We establish the optimality of an oracle greedy solution in a simple two-state setting, and propose an algorithm that achieves minimax optimal constant regret in the online multi-state setting with heterogeneous agents and knowledge of outcomes under no intervention. We numerically show that our algorithm outperforms existing online restless bandit methods, offering significant improvements in finite-horizon performance.

Abstract: Large language models have been used to simulate human society using multi-agent systems. Most current social simulation research emphasizes interactive behaviors in fixed environments, ignoring information opacity, relationship variability and diffusion diversity. In this paper, we study the dynamics of information diffusion in 12 asymmetric open environments defined by information content and distribution mechanisms. We first present a general framework to capture the features of information diffusion. Then, we designed a dynamic attention mechanism to help agents allocate attention to different information, addressing the limitations of LLM-based attention. Agents start by responding to external information stimuli within a five-agent group, increasing group size and forming information circles while developing relationships and sharing information. Additionally, we observe the emergence of information cocoons, the evolution of information gaps, and the accumulation of social capital, which are closely linked to psychological, sociological, and communication theories.

<div> 关键词: 动态离散选择模型、最大熵逆强化学习、无监督学习、神经网络、Polyak-Lojasiewicz条件

总结:
本文研究了动态离散选择模型(也称为无监督最大熵逆强化学习)的估计问题，旨在从离线行为数据中恢复调控代理行为的奖励或$Q^*$函数。文章提出了一种无需线性参数化奖励假设的全局收敛梯度基方法。该方法创新地引入基于经验风险最小化的IRL/DDC框架，规避了在贝尔曼方程中对状态转移概率的直接估计需求，并兼容非参数估计技术如神经网络，因此有望应用于高维、无限状态空间的问题。理论分析表明，我们的方法所依据的贝尔曼残差满足较弱的Polyak-Lojasiewicz条件，这一性质足以保证快速全局收敛保证。通过一系列合成实验，证明了本文方法相较于基准方法和现有最先进的替代方案具有更优的表现。 <div>

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also known as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning (offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: Biological processes, functions, and properties are intricately linked to the ensemble of protein conformations, rather than being solely determined by a single stable conformation. In this study, we have developed P2DFlow, a generative model based on SE(3) flow matching, to predict the structural ensembles of proteins. We specifically designed a valuable prior for the flow process and enhanced the model's ability to distinguish each intermediate state by incorporating an additional dimension to describe the ensemble data, which can reflect the physical laws governing the distribution of ensembles, so that the prior knowledge can effectively guide the generation process. When trained and evaluated on the MD datasets of ATLAS, P2DFlow outperforms other baseline models on extensive experiments, successfully capturing the observable dynamic fluctuations as evidenced in crystal structure and MD simulations. As a potential proxy agent for protein molecular simulation, the high-quality ensembles generated by P2DFlow could significantly aid in understanding protein functions across various scenarios.

Abstract: The design and deployment of autonomous systems for space missions require robust solutions to navigate strict reliability constraints, extended operational duration, and communication challenges. This study evaluates the stability and performance of a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework designed for multi-agent satellite inspection tasks. The proposed framework integrates a high-level guidance policy with a low-level motion controller, enabling scalable task allocation and efficient trajectory execution. Experiments conducted on the Local Intelligent Network of Collaborative Satellites (LINCS) testbed assess the framework's performance under varying levels of fidelity, from simulated environments to a cyber-physical testbed. Key metrics, including task completion rate, distance traveled, and fuel consumption, highlight the framework's robustness and adaptability despite real-world uncertainties such as sensor noise, dynamic perturbations, and runtime assurance (RTA) constraints. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical controller effectively bridges the sim-to-real gap, maintaining high task completion rates while adapting to the complexities of real-world environments. These findings validate the framework's potential for enabling autonomous satellite operations in future space missions.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit remarkable performance across diverse applications by using external tools to interact with environments. However, integrating external tools introduces security risks, such as indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks. Despite defenses designed for IPI attacks, their robustness remains questionable due to insufficient testing against adaptive attacks. In this paper, we evaluate eight different defenses and bypass all of them using adaptive attacks, consistently achieving an attack success rate of over 50%. This reveals critical vulnerabilities in current defenses. Our research underscores the need for adaptive attack evaluation when designing defenses to ensure robustness and reliability.

Abstract: This study presents the conflict-aware multi-agent estimated time of arrival (CAMETA) framework, a novel approach for predicting the arrival times of multiple agents in unstructured environments without predefined road infrastructure. The CAMETA framework consists of three components: a path planning layer generating potential path suggestions, a multi-agent ETA prediction layer predicting the arrival times for all agents based on the paths, and lastly, a path selection layer that calculates the accumulated cost and selects the best path. The novelty of the CAMETA framework lies in the heterogeneous map representation and the heterogeneous graph neural network architecture. As a result of the proposed novel structure, CAMETA improves the generalization capability compared to the state-of-the-art methods that rely on structured road infrastructure and historical data. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the multi-agent ETA prediction layer, with a mean average percentage error improvement of 29.5% and 44% when compared to a traditional path planning method (A *) which does not consider conflicts. The performance of the CAMETA framework shows significant improvements in terms of robustness to noise and conflicts as well as determining proficient routes compared to state-of-the-art multi-agent path planners.

Abstract: Social media has become integral to minors' daily lives and is used for various purposes, such as making friends, exploring shared interests, and engaging in educational activities. However, the increase in screen time has also led to heightened challenges, including cyberbullying, online grooming, and exploitations posed by malicious actors. Traditional content moderation techniques have proven ineffective against exploiters' evolving tactics. To address these growing challenges, we propose the EdgeAIGuard content moderation approach that is designed to protect minors from online grooming and various forms of digital exploitation. The proposed method comprises a multi-agent architecture deployed strategically at the network edge to enable rapid detection with low latency and prevent harmful content targeting minors. The experimental results show the proposed method is significantly more effective than the existing approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively leverage common-sense knowledge for general reasoning, yet they struggle with personalized reasoning when tasked with interpreting multifactor personal data. This limitation restricts their applicability in domains that require context-aware decision-making tailored to individuals. This paper introduces Personalized Causal Graph Reasoning as an agentic framework that enhances LLM reasoning by incorporating personal causal graphs derived from data of individuals. These graphs provide a foundation that guides the LLM's reasoning process. We evaluate it on a case study on nutrient-oriented dietary recommendations, which requires personal reasoning due to the implicit unique dietary effects. We propose a counterfactual evaluation to estimate the efficiency of LLM-recommended foods for glucose management. Results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently provides personalized dietary recommendations to reduce average glucose iAUC across three time windows, which outperforms the previous approach. LLM-as-a-judge evaluation results indicate that our proposed method enhances personalization in the reasoning process.

Abstract: In recent years, online lecture videos have become an increasingly popular resource for acquiring new knowledge. Systems capable of effectively understanding/indexing lecture videos are thus highly desirable, enabling downstream tasks like question answering to help users efficiently locate specific information within videos. This work proposes PreMind, a novel multi-agent multimodal framework that leverages various large models for advanced understanding/indexing of presentation-style videos. PreMind first segments videos into slide-presentation segments using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to enhance modern shot-detection techniques. Each segment is then analyzed to generate multimodal indexes through three key steps: (1) extracting slide visual content, (2) transcribing speech narratives, and (3) consolidating these visual and speech contents into an integrated understanding. Three innovative mechanisms are also proposed to improve performance: leveraging prior lecture knowledge to refine visual understanding, detecting/correcting speech transcription errors using a VLM, and utilizing a critic agent for dynamic iterative self-reflection in vision analysis. Compared to traditional video indexing methods, PreMind captures rich, reliable multimodal information, allowing users to search for details like abbreviations shown only on slides. Systematic evaluations on the public LPM dataset and an internal enterprise dataset are conducted to validate PreMind's effectiveness, supported by detailed analyses.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a potent paradigm for autonomous decision-making in complex environments. However, the integration of event-driven decision processes within RL remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel architecture that combines a Discrete Event Supervisory (DES) model with a standard RL framework to create a hybrid decision-making system. Our model leverages the DES's capabilities in managing event-based dynamics with the RL agent's adaptability to continuous states and actions, facilitating a more robust and flexible control strategy in systems characterized by both continuous and discrete events. The DES model operates alongside the RL agent, enhancing the policy's performance with event-based insights, while the environment's state transitions are governed by a mechanistic model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulations that show improved performance metrics over traditional RL implementations. Our results suggest that this integrated approach holds promise for applications ranging from industrial automation to intelligent traffic systems, where discrete event handling is paramount.

Abstract: The endowment of AI with reasoning capabilities and some degree of agency is widely viewed as a path toward more capable and generalizable systems. Our position is that the current development of agentic AI requires a more holistic, systems-theoretic perspective in order to fully understand their capabilities and mitigate any emergent risks. The primary motivation for our position is that AI development is currently overly focused on individual model capabilities, often ignoring broader emergent behavior, leading to a significant underestimation in the true capabilities and associated risks of agentic AI. We describe some fundamental mechanisms by which advanced capabilities can emerge from (comparably simpler) agents simply due to their interaction with the environment and other agents. Informed by an extensive amount of existing literature from various fields, we outline mechanisms for enhanced agent cognition, emergent causal reasoning ability, and metacognitive awareness. We conclude by presenting some key open challenges and guidance for the development of agentic AI. We emphasize that a systems-level perspective is essential for better understanding, and purposefully shaping, agentic AI systems.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the TREC Interactive Knowledge Assistance Track (iKAT), which focuses on improving conversational information-seeking (CIS) systems. While recent advancements in CIS have improved conversational agents' ability to assist users, significant challenges remain in understanding context and retrieving relevant documents across domains and dialogue turns. To address these issues, we extend the Generate-Retrieve-Generate pipeline by developing passage queries (PQs) that align with the target document's expected format to improve query-document matching during retrieval. We propose two variations of this approach: Weighted Reranking and Short and Long Passages. Each method leverages a Meta Llama model for context understanding and generating queries and responses. Passage ranking evaluation results show that the Short and Long Passages approach outperformed the organizers' baselines, performed best among Llama-based systems in the track, and achieved results comparable to GPT-4-based systems. These results indicate that the method effectively balances efficiency and performance. Findings suggest that PQs improve semantic alignment with target documents and demonstrate their potential to improve multi-turn dialogue systems.

Abstract: Despite the growing interest in collaborative AI, designing systems that seamlessly integrate human input remains a major challenge. In this study, we developed a task to systematically examine human preferences for collaborative agents. We created and evaluated five collaborative AI agents with strategies that differ in the manner and degree they adapt to human actions. Participants interacted with a subset of these agents, evaluated their perceived traits, and selected their preferred agent. We used a Bayesian model to understand how agents' strategies influence the Human-AI team performance, AI's perceived traits, and the factors shaping human-preferences in pairwise agent comparisons. Our results show that agents who are more considerate of human actions are preferred over purely performance-maximizing agents. Moreover, we show that such human-centric design can improve the likability of AI collaborators without reducing performance. We find evidence for inequality-aversion effects being a driver of human choices, suggesting that people prefer collaborative agents which allow them to meaningfully contribute to the team. Taken together, these findings demonstrate how collaboration with AI can benefit from development efforts which include both subjective and objective metrics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in various robotic tasks; however, its deployment in real-world scenarios, particularly in contact-rich environments, often overlooks critical safety and stability aspects. Policies without passivity guarantees can result in system instability, posing risks to robots, their environments, and human operators. In this work, we investigate the limitations of traditional RL policies when deployed in contact-rich tasks and explore the combination of energy-based passive control with safe RL in both training and deployment to answer these challenges. Firstly, we introduce energy-based constraints in our safe RL formulation to train \textit{passivity-aware} RL agents. Secondly, we add a passivity filter on the agent output for \textit{passivity-ensured} control during deployment. We conduct comparative studies on a contact-rich robotic maze exploration task, evaluating the effects of learning passivity-aware policies and the importance of passivity-ensured control. The experiments demonstrate that a passivity-agnostic RL policy easily violates energy constraints in deployment, even though it achieves high task completion in training. The results show that our proposed approach guarantees control stability through passivity filtering and improves the energy efficiency through passivity-aware training. A video of real-world experiments is available as supplementary material. We also release the checkpoint model and offline data for pre-training at \href{https://huggingface.co/Anonymous998/passiveRL/tree/main}{Hugging Face}

<div> 关键词: 多任务表示学习(MRL), 强化学习(RL), 非线性表示, 在线学习, 迁移学习<br /><br />总结:<br />
本文关注多任务表示学习（MRL）在强化学习中的应用，尤其是在在线和迁移学习环境下的效率提升。尽管MRL广泛应用，但对其操作有效性的全面理论框架尚未完善。研究指出，以往分析主要假设代理具有预知的表示函数或使用线性类函数，而现实世界的复杂情况需要非线性函数，如神经网络。为此，文章填补了这一理论空白，将分析扩展到未知非线性表示，并提出了一种新的通用功能上界置信边界算法（GFUCB），使代理能够同时从多个上下文臂（或MDP）中学习并共享一个来自非线性函数类$\Phi$的表示函数$\phi$。通过形式化证明，这种方法的学习后悔上界优于单独学习多个任务的下界，首次展示了MRL在一般函数类中的有效性。此外，该框架还解释了在面临新但相关的任务时，表示对于迁移学习的贡献以及成功迁移的关键条件。实验结果进一步证实了这些理论发现。 <div>

Abstract: Multitask Representation Learning (MRL) has emerged as a prevalent technique to improve sample efficiency in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Empirical studies have found that training agents on multiple tasks simultaneously within online and transfer learning environments can greatly improve efficiency. Despite its popularity, a comprehensive theoretical framework that elucidates its operational efficacy remains incomplete. Prior analyses have predominantly assumed that agents either possess a pre-known representation function or utilize functions from a linear class, where both are impractical. The complexity of real-world applications typically requires the use of sophisticated, non-linear functions such as neural networks as representation function, which are not pre-existing but must be learned. Our work tries to fill the gap by extending the analysis to \textit{unknown non-linear} representations, giving a comprehensive analysis for its mechanism in online and transfer learning setting. We consider the setting that an agent simultaneously playing $M$ contextual bandits (or MDPs), developing a shared representation function $\phi$ from a non-linear function class $\Phi$ using our novel Generalized Functional Upper Confidence Bound algorithm (GFUCB). We formally prove that this approach yields a regret upper bound that outperforms the lower bound associated with learning $M$ separate tasks, marking the first demonstration of MRL's efficacy in a general function class. This framework also explains the contribution of representations to transfer learning when faced with new, yet related tasks, and identifies key conditions for successful transfer. Empirical experiments further corroborate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: From disinformation spread by AI chatbots to AI recommendations that inadvertently reinforce stereotypes, textual bias poses a significant challenge to the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework that systematically identifies biases by disentangling each statement as fact or opinion, assigning a bias intensity score, and providing concise, factual justifications. Evaluated on 1,500 samples from the WikiNPOV dataset, the framework achieves 84.9% accuracy$\unicode{x2014}$an improvement of 13.0% over the zero-shot baseline$\unicode{x2014}$demonstrating the efficacy of explicitly modeling fact versus opinion prior to quantifying bias intensity. By combining enhanced detection accuracy with interpretable explanations, this approach sets a foundation for promoting fairness and accountability in modern language models.

Abstract: In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), agents typically form a single grand coalition based on credit assignment to tackle a composite task, often resulting in suboptimal performance. This paper proposed a nucleolus-based credit assignment grounded in cooperative game theory, enabling the autonomous partitioning of agents into multiple small coalitions that can effectively identify and complete subtasks within a larger composite task. Specifically, our designed nucleolus Q-learning could assign fair credits to each agent, and the nucleolus Q-operator provides theoretical guarantees with interpretability for both learning convergence and the stability of the formed small coalitions. Through experiments on Predator-Prey and StarCraft scenarios across varying difficulty levels, our approach demonstrated the emergence of multiple effective coalitions during MARL training, leading to faster learning and superior performance in terms of win rate and cumulative rewards especially in hard and super-hard environments, compared to four baseline methods. Our nucleolus-based credit assignment showed the promise for complex composite tasks requiring effective subteams of agents.

<br /><br />总结:
该文提出了一种针对资源受限场景下图形用户界面（GUI）代理的感知增强预训练新方法——查询推理（query inference）。研究发现，当前坐标导向的接地技术与动作导向的推理任务之间存在格式不匹配的问题，限制了接地技术在推理任务中的有效性。为解决这一挑战，文中提出了将GUI接地与推理相结合的桥梁——查询推理方法，它能从屏幕截图及其关联元素坐标中推断潜在用户查询，从而增强对坐标的理解并更好地贴近推理任务需求。实验结果显示，查询推理在同等规模的训练数据下优于先前的接地技术，并且仅使用不到0.1%的训练数据即可达到甚至超越大规模接地增强的OS-Atlas性能。此外，文章还探讨了推理格式的影响，并证明了将额外语义信息融入输入可以进一步提升推理性能。相关代码已公开发布在https://github.com/ZrW00/GUIPivot上。 <div>

Abstract: Perception-enhanced pre-training, particularly through grounding techniques, is widely adopted to enhance the performance of graphical user interface (GUI) agents. However, in resource-constrained scenarios, the format discrepancy between coordinate-oriented grounding and action-oriented reasoning limits the effectiveness of grounding for reasoning tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a query-oriented pivot approach called query inference, which serves as a bridge between GUI grounding and reasoning. By inferring potential user queries from a screenshot and its associated element coordinates, query inference improves the understanding of coordinates while aligning more closely with reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that query inference outperforms previous grounding techniques under the same training data scale. Notably, query inference achieves comparable or even better performance to large-scale grounding-enhanced OS-Atlas with less than 0.1% of training data. Furthermore, we explore the impact of reasoning formats and demonstrate that integrating additional semantic information into the input further boosts reasoning performance. The code is publicly available athttps://github.com/ZrW00/GUIPivot.

Abstract: Existing Existing automatic audio generation methods struggle to generate podcast-like audio programs effectively. The key challenges lie in in-depth content generation, appropriate and expressive voice production. This paper proposed PodAgent, a comprehensive framework for creating audio programs. PodAgent 1) generates informative topic-discussion content by designing a Host-Guest-Writer multi-agent collaboration system, 2) builds a voice pool for suitable voice-role matching and 3) utilizes LLM-enhanced speech synthesis method to generate expressive conversational speech. Given the absence of standardized evaluation criteria for podcast-like audio generation, we developed comprehensive assessment guidelines to effectively evaluate the model's performance. Experimental results demonstrate PodAgent's effectiveness, significantly surpassing direct GPT-4 generation in topic-discussion dialogue content, achieving an 87.4% voice-matching accuracy, and producing more expressive speech through LLM-guided synthesis.

Abstract: The Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025 caused more than 250 billion dollars in damage and lasted for nearly an entire month before containment. Following our previous work, the Digital Twin Building, we modify and leverage the multi-agent large language model framework as well as the cloud-mapping integration to study the air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires. Recent advances in large language models have allowed for out-of-the-box automated large-scale data analysis. We use a multi-agent large language system comprised of an Instructor agent and Worker agents. Upon receiving the users' instructions, the Instructor agent retrieves the data from the cloud platform and produces instruction prompts to the Worker agents. The Worker agents then analyze the data and provide summaries. The summaries are finally input back into the Instructor agent, which then provides the final data analysis. We test this system's capability for data-based policy recommendation by assessing our Instructor-Worker LLM system's health recommendations based on air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), world models serve as internal simulators, enabling agents to predict environment dynamics and future outcomes in order to make informed decisions. While previous approaches leveraging discrete latent spaces, such as DreamerV3, have demonstrated strong performance in discrete action settings and visual control tasks, their comparative performance in state-based continuous control remains underexplored. In contrast, methods with continuous latent spaces, such as TD-MPC2, have shown notable success in state-based continuous control benchmarks. In this paper, we demonstrate that modeling discrete latent states has benefits over continuous latent states and that discrete codebook encodings are more effective representations for continuous control, compared to alternative encodings, such as one-hot and label-based encodings. Based on these insights, we introduce DCWM: Discrete Codebook World Model, a self-supervised world model with a discrete and stochastic latent space, where latent states are codes from a codebook. We combine DCWM with decision-time planning to get our model-based RL algorithm, named DC-MPC: Discrete Codebook Model Predictive Control, which performs competitively against recent state-of-the-art algorithms, including TD-MPC2 and DreamerV3, on continuous control benchmarks.

Abstract: Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) are a growing concern, characterized by complexity and uncertainty that demand adaptive decision-making strategies. The victim tagging step in the emergency medical response must be completed quickly and is crucial for providing information to guide subsequent time-constrained response actions. In this paper, we present a mathematical formulation of multi-agent victim tagging to minimize the time it takes for responders to tag all victims. Five distributed heuristics are formulated and evaluated with simulation experiments. The heuristics considered are on-the go, practical solutions that represent varying levels of situational uncertainty in the form of global or local communication capabilities, showcasing practical constraints. We further investigate the performance of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) strategy, factorized deep Q-network (FDQN), to minimize victim tagging time as compared to baseline heuristics. Extensive simulations demonstrate that between the heuristics, methods with local communication are more efficient for adaptive victim tagging, specifically choosing the nearest victim with the option to replan. Analyzing all experiments, we find that our FDQN approach outperforms heuristics in smaller-scale scenarios, while heuristics excel in more complex scenarios. Our experiments contain diverse complexities that explore the upper limits of MARL capabilities for real-world applications and reveal key insights.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) is a core challenge in multi-agent systems. Existing learning-based MAPF methods often struggle with scalability, particularly when addressing complex scenarios that are prone to deadlocks. To address these challenges, we introduce LLMDR (LLM-Driven Deadlock Detection and Resolution), an approach designed to resolve deadlocks and improve the performance of learnt MAPF models. LLMDR integrates the inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with learnt MAPF models and prioritized planning, enabling it to detect deadlocks and provide customized resolution strategies. We evaluate LLMDR on standard MAPF benchmark maps with varying agent numbers, measuring its performance when combined with several base models. The results demonstrate that LLMDR improves the performance of learnt MAPF models, particularly in deadlock-prone scenarios, with notable improvements in success rates. These findings show the potential of integrating LLMs to improve the scalability of learning-based MAPF methods.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation on social media has raised significant societal concerns, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. Large Language Models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA2 have been envisioned as possible tools for detecting misinformation based on their advanced natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. This paper conducts a comparison of LLM-based approaches to detecting misinformation between text-based, multimodal, and agentic approaches. We evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuned models, zero-shot learning, and systematic fact-checking mechanisms in detecting misinformation across different topic domains like public health, politics, and finance. We also discuss scalability, generalizability, and explainability of the models and recognize key challenges such as hallucination, adversarial attacks on misinformation, and computational resources. Our findings point towards the importance of hybrid approaches that pair structured verification protocols with adaptive learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy and explainability. The paper closes by suggesting potential avenues of future work, including real-time tracking of misinformation, federated learning, and cross-platform detection models.

Abstract: Generating knowledge-intensive and comprehensive long texts, such as encyclopedia articles, remains significant challenges for Large Language Models. It requires not only the precise integration of facts but also the maintenance of thematic coherence throughout the article. Existing methods, such as direct generation and multi-agent discussion, often struggle with issues like hallucinations, topic incoherence, and significant latency. To address these challenges, we propose RAPID, an efficient retrieval-augmented long text generation framework. RAPID consists of three main modules: (1) Retrieval-augmented preliminary outline generation to reduce hallucinations, (2) Attribute-constrained search for efficient information discovery, (3) Plan-guided article generation for enhanced coherence. Extensive experiments on our newly compiled benchmark dataset, FreshWiki-2024, demonstrate that RAPID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of evaluation metrics (e.g. long-text generation, outline quality, latency, etc). Our work provides a robust and efficient solution to the challenges of automated long-text generation.

本文提出了一种名为TRACE的新颖推理框架，用于增强基于Vision-Language Models (VLMs)的行为预测能力。当对目标反应性代理的观察数据稀疏或间断时，预测其短期行为具有挑战性。TRACE利用迭代和反事实探索的方法，通过生成树状思维并结合领域感知反馈，多轮次地细化行为假设。首先，VLM 提出候选轨迹；随后，一个反事实批评模块根据部分观测数据建议边缘情况变化，促使 VLM 在下一轮中扩展或调整其假设。这一过程形成了一个自我改进的循环，使得 VLM 逐步从以往轮次中内化边缘案例，系统地揭示了不仅包括典型行为，也包括罕见或临界操作在内的多种可能行为。实验表明，与标准 VLM 驱动和纯模型基线相比，TRACE 方法能在传感器数据极稀少的情况下，更准确、全面地预测目标代理的行为。研究成果已在地面车辆仿真及真实世界的海洋自主水面航行器上得到验证。相关评估视频和代码可在trace-robotics.github.io获取。 <div>

Abstract: Predicting the near-term behavior of a reactive agent is crucial in many robotic scenarios, yet remains challenging when observations of that agent are sparse or intermittent. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising avenue by integrating textual domain knowledge with visual cues, but their one-shot predictions often miss important edge cases and unusual maneuvers. Our key insight is that iterative, counterfactual exploration--where a dedicated module probes each proposed behavior hypothesis, explicitly represented as a plausible trajectory, for overlooked possibilities--can significantly enhance VLM-based behavioral forecasting. We present TRACE (Tree-of-thought Reasoning And Counterfactual Exploration), an inference framework that couples tree-of-thought generation with domain-aware feedback to refine behavior hypotheses over multiple rounds. Concretely, a VLM first proposes candidate trajectories for the agent; a counterfactual critic then suggests edge-case variations consistent with partial observations, prompting the VLM to expand or adjust its hypotheses in the next iteration. This creates a self-improving cycle where the VLM progressively internalizes edge cases from previous rounds, systematically uncovering not only typical behaviors but also rare or borderline maneuvers, ultimately yielding more robust trajectory predictions from minimal sensor data. We validate TRACE on both ground-vehicle simulations and real-world marine autonomous surface vehicles. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms standard VLM-driven and purely model-based baselines, capturing a broader range of feasible agent behaviors despite sparse sensing.

Abstract: Personalized tool utilization is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preference in interaction scenarios with various tools. However, most of the current benchmarks primarily focus on either personalization of text generation or direct tool-utilizing, without considering both. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark ETAPP for evaluating personalized tool invocation, establishing a sandbox environment, and a comprehensive dataset of 800 testing cases covering diverse user profiles. To improve the accuracy of our evaluation, we propose a key-point-based LLM evaluation method, mitigating biases in the LLM-as-a-judge system by manually annotating key points for each test case and providing them to LLM as the reference. Additionally, we evaluate the excellent LLMs and provide an in-depth analysis. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different tool-invoking strategies on LLMs' personalization performance and the effects of fine-tuning in our task. The effectiveness of our preference-setting and key-point-based evaluation method is also validated. Our findings offer insights into improving personalized LLM agents.

Abstract: We explore neuro-symbolic approaches to generalize actionable knowledge, enabling embodied agents to tackle complex tasks more effectively in open-domain environments. A key challenge for embodied agents is the generalization of knowledge across diverse environments and situations, as limited experiences often confine them to their prior knowledge. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework, NeSyC, a neuro-symbolic continual learner that emulates the hypothetico-deductive model by continually formulating and validating knowledge from limited experiences through the combined use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic tools. Specifically, we devise a contrastive generality improvement scheme within NeSyC, which iteratively generates hypotheses using LLMs and conducts contrastive validation via symbolic tools. This scheme reinforces the justification for admissible actions while minimizing the inference of inadmissible ones. Additionally, we incorporate a memory-based monitoring scheme that efficiently detects action errors and triggers the knowledge refinement process across domains. Experiments conducted on diverse embodied task benchmarks-including ALFWorld, VirtualHome, Minecraft, RLBench, and a real-world robotic scenario-demonstrate that NeSyC is highly effective in solving complex embodied tasks across a range of open-domain environments.

Abstract: Defects in extrusion additive manufacturing remain common despite its prevalent use. While numerous AI-driven approaches have been proposed to improve quality assurance, the inherently dynamic nature of the printing process poses persistent challenges. Regardless of how comprehensive the training dataset is, out-of-distribution data remains inevitable. Consequently, deterministic models often struggle to maintain robustness and, in some cases, fail entirely when deployed in new or slightly altered printing environments. This work introduces an agent that dynamically adjusts flow rate and temperature setpoints in real time, optimizing process control while addressing bottlenecks in training efficiency and uncertainty management. It integrates a vision-based uncertainty quantification module with a reinforcement learning controller, using probabilistic distributions to describe printing segments. While the underlying networks are deterministic, these evolving distributions introduce adaptability into the decision-making process. The vision system classifies material extrusion with a certain level of precision, generating corresponding distributions. A deep Q-learning controller interacts with a simulated environment calibrated to the vision system precision, allowing the agent to learn optimal actions while demonstrating appropriate hesitation when necessary. By executing asynchronous actions and applying progressively tightened elliptical reward shaping, the controller develops robust, adaptive control strategies that account for the coupling effects between process parameters. When deployed with zero-shot learning, the agent effectively bridges the sim-to-real gap, correcting mild and severe under- and over-extrusion reliably. Beyond extrusion additive manufacturing, this scalable framework enables practical AI-driven quality assurance across various additive manufacturing processes.

总结:

本文报道了首个基于多智能体强化学习（MARL）的变速度限制（VSL）控制系统在田纳西州纳什维尔附近的Interstate 24（I-24）路段的实际部署。系统自2024年3月8日启动以来，已在六个月内对约2800万次行程做出了约3500万个决策。研究者设计了一个从在交通模拟器中训练MARL代理到实际部署涵盖67个VSL控制器的完整流程，并采用了无效动作屏蔽机制和多重安全保障措施以确保满足现实世界约束。MARL基础实施的运行效率高达98%，其余时间由安全防护措施覆盖其决定。与先前部署在I-24上的非RL VSL基准算法相比，MARL基测控系统的性能更优，提高了提前警告驾驶员前方缓慢交通情况的准确度达14%，减少了应对非周期性拥堵的响应延迟达75%。初步数据显示，VSL控制系统使得事故率下降了26%，二次事故率降低了50%。相关开源代码已发布于https://github.com/Lab-Work/marl-vsl-controller。 <div>

Abstract: This article presents the first field deployment of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based variable speed limit (VSL) control system on Interstate 24 (I-24) near Nashville, Tennessee. We design and demonstrate a full pipeline from training MARL agents in a traffic simulator to a field deployment on a 17-mile segment of I-24 encompassing 67 VSL controllers. The system was launched on March 8th, 2024, and has made approximately 35 million decisions on 28 million trips in six months of operation. We apply an invalid action masking mechanism and several safety guards to ensure real-world constraints. The MARL-based implementation operates up to 98% of the time, with the safety guards overriding the MARL decisions for the remaining time. We evaluate the performance of the MARL-based algorithm in comparison to a previously deployed non-RL VSL benchmark algorithm on I-24. Results show that the MARL-based VSL control system achieves a superior performance. The accuracy of correctly warning drivers about slowing traffic ahead is improved by 14% and the response delay to non-recurrent congestion is reduced by 75%. The preliminary data shows that the VSL control system has reduced the crash rate by 26% and the secondary crash rate by 50%. We open-sourced the deployed MARL-based VSL algorithm at https://github.com/Lab-Work/marl-vsl-controller.

总结:<br />
本文探讨了如何将视觉语言模型（VLMs）提供的反馈有效整合到强化学习（RL）的学习过程中，特别是在没有互联网规模控制数据的情况下。文章提出了一种名为“子轨迹过滤优化”的方法，适用于离线RL。研究发现了三个关键点：1）在离线RL中，轨迹长度至关重要，使用完整轨迹进行偏好学习会加剧拼接问题，因此需要利用子轨迹；2）即使在马尔可夫环境中，也需要非马尔可夫的奖励信号（来自图像序列），因为VLM无法解释控制动作，而需依赖于随时间变化的视觉线索；3）简单但有效的过滤并加权行为克隆方法优于基于人类反馈的复杂强化学习方法。为此，文章提出了子轨迹过滤行为克隆法，该方法利用VLM对子轨迹的反馈，并结合一种去除失败前子轨迹的回顾性过滤机制，以提高稳健性和防止训练不稳定性。实验在玩具控制域上初步验证了这种方法的有效性。 <div>

Abstract: While internet-scale image and textual data have enabled strong generalization in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the absence of internet-scale control data has impeded the development of similar generalization in standard reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Although VLMs are fundamentally limited in their ability to solve control tasks due to their lack of action-conditioned training data, their capacity for image understanding allows them to provide valuable feedback in RL tasks by recognizing successful outcomes. A key challenge in Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is determining how best to integrate VLM-derived signals into the learning process. We explore this question in the context of offline RL and introduce a class of methods called sub-trajectory filtered optimization. We identify three key insights. First, trajectory length plays a crucial role in offline RL, as full-trajectory preference learning exacerbates the stitching problem, necessitating the use of sub-trajectories. Second, even in Markovian environments, a non-Markovian reward signal from a sequence of images is required to assess trajectory improvement, as VLMs do not interpret control actions and must rely on visual cues over time. Third, a simple yet effective approach--filtered and weighted behavior cloning--consistently outperforms more complex reinforcement learning from human feedback-based methods. We propose sub-trajectory filtered behavior cloning, a method that leverages VLM feedback on sub-trajectories while incorporating a retrospective filtering mechanism that removes sub-trajectories preceding failures to improve robustness and prevent turbulence. This study is preliminary; we provide initial evidence through evaluations on a toy control domain. Please enjoy our airport puns.

Abstract: Extensive research on graph-based dynamics and control of multi-agent systems has successfully demonstrated control of robotic swarms, where each robot is perceived as an independent agent virtually connected by a network topology. The strong advantage of the network control structure lies in the decentralized nature of the control action, which only requires the knowledge of virtually connected agents. In this paper, we seek to expand the ideas of virtual network constraints to physical constraints on a class of tree-structured robots which we denote as single articulated robotic (SAR) systems. In our proposed framework, each link can be viewed as an agent, and each holonomic constraint connecting links serves as an edge. By following the first principles of Lagrangian dynamics, we derive a consensus-like matrix-differential equation with weighted graph and edge Laplacians for the dynamics of a SAR system. The sufficient condition for the holonomic constraint forces becoming independent to the control inputs is derived. This condition leads to a decentralized leader-follower network control framework for regulating the relative configuration of the robot. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

Abstract: Management of sensing resources is a non-trivial problem for future military air assets with future systems deploying heterogeneous sensors to generate information of the battlespace. Machine learning techniques including deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have been identified as promising approaches, but require high-fidelity training environments and feature extractors to generate information for the agent. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning training approach, utilising the Stone Soup tracking framework as a feature extractor to train an agent for a sensor management task. A general framework for embedding Stone Soup tracker components within a Gymnasium environment is presented, enabling fast and configurable tracker deployments for RL training using Stable Baselines3. The approach is demonstrated in a sensor management task where an agent is trained to search and track a region of airspace utilising track lists generated from Stone Soup trackers. A sample implementation using three neural network architectures in a search-and-track scenario demonstrates the approach and shows that RL agents can outperform simple sensor search and track policies when trained within the Gymnasium and Stone Soup environment.

Abstract: Knowing when to answer or refuse is crucial for safe and reliable decision-making language agents. Although prior work has introduced refusal strategies to boost LMs' reliability, how these models adapt their decisions to different risk levels remains underexplored. We formalize the task of risk-aware decision-making, expose critical weaknesses in existing LMs, and propose skill-decomposition solutions to mitigate them. Our findings show that even cutting-edge LMs--both regular and reasoning models--still require explicit prompt chaining to handle the task effectively, revealing the challenges that must be overcome to achieve truly autonomous decision-making agents.

Abstract: With increasing social mobility and an aging society, more older adults in China are migrating to new cities, known as "older drifters." Due to fewer social connections and cultural adaptation challenges, they face negative emotions such as loneliness and depression. While reminiscence-based interventions have been used to improve older adults' psychological well-being, challenges such as the lack of tangible materials and limited social resources constrain the feasibility of traditional reminiscence approaches for older drifters. To address this challenge, we designed RemiHaven, a personalized reminiscence support tool based on a two-phase formative study. It integrates "In-Town" and "Out-of-Town" peer agents to enhance personalization, engagement, and emotional resonance in the reminiscence process, powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our evaluations show RemiHaven's strengths in supporting reminiscence while identifying potential challenges. We conclude by offering insights for the future design of reminiscence support tools for older migrants.

Abstract: We initiate the study of computing envy-free allocations of indivisible items in the extension setting, i.e., when some part of the allocation is fixed and the task is to allocate the remaining items. Given the known NP-hardness of the problem, we investigate whether -- and under which conditions -- one can obtain fixed-parameter algorithms for computing a solution in settings where most of the allocation is already fixed. Our results provide a broad complexity-theoretic classification of the problem which includes: (a) fixed-parameter algorithms tailored to settings with few distinct types of agents or items; (b) lower bounds which exclude the generalization of these positive results to more general settings. We conclude by showing that -- unlike when computing allocations from scratch -- the non-algorithmic question of whether more relaxed EFX allocations exist can be completely resolved in the extension setting.

Abstract: Recent works have successfully demonstrated that sparse deep reinforcement learning agents can be competitive against their dense counterparts. This opens up opportunities for reinforcement learning applications in fields where inference time and memory requirements are cost-sensitive or limited by hardware. Until now, dense-to-sparse methods have relied on hand-designed sparsity schedules that are not synchronized with the agent's learning pace. Crucially, the final sparsity level is chosen as a hyperparameter, which requires careful tuning as setting it too high might lead to poor performances. In this work, we address these shortcomings by crafting a dense-to-sparse algorithm that we name Eau De $Q$-Network (EauDeQN). To increase sparsity at the agent's learning pace, we consider multiple online networks with different sparsity levels, where each online network is trained from a shared target network. At each target update, the online network with the smallest loss is chosen as the next target network, while the other networks are replaced by a pruned version of the chosen network. We evaluate the proposed approach on the Atari $2600$ benchmark and the MuJoCo physics simulator, showing that EauDeQN reaches high sparsity levels while keeping performances high.

Abstract: In the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning, generalization is a challenge to solve various tasks that may require different joint policies or coordination without relying on policies specialized for each task. We refer to this type of problem as a multi-task, and we train agents to be versatile in this multi-task setting through a single training process. To address this challenge, we introduce TRajectory-class-Aware Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (TRAMA). In TRAMA, agents recognize a task type by identifying the class of trajectories they are experiencing through partial observations, and the agents use this trajectory awareness or prediction as additional information for action policy. To this end, we introduce three primary objectives in TRAMA: (a) constructing a quantized latent space to generate trajectory embeddings that reflect key similarities among them; (b) conducting trajectory clustering using these trajectory embeddings; and (c) building a trajectory-class-aware policy. Specifically for (c), we introduce a trajectory-class predictor that performs agent-wise predictions on the trajectory class; and we design a trajectory-class representation model for each trajectory class. Each agent takes actions based on this trajectory-class representation along with its partial observation for task-aware execution. The proposed method is evaluated on various tasks, including multi-task problems built upon StarCraft II. Empirical results show further performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

总结:
本文提出了一种针对大规模真实世界系统中的多智能体强化学习(MARL)新框架——序列化 rollout 与顺序值估计(SrSv)。该框架旨在解决现实中复杂环境导致的信用分配问题以及大规模场景中智能体群体变化带来的可扩展性挑战。SrSv利用Transformer模型的自回归性质处理动态的智能体行为序列，并通过引入创新的顺序值估计方法，将价值函数近似整合到注意力机制驱动的序贯模型中。实验结果显示，SrSv在Multi-Agent MuJoCo、StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge和DubinsCars三个基准测试上均表现出优于基线方法的训练效率和收敛性能。特别是在包含1024个智能体的大规模DubinsCar系统中，SrSv框架表现出了卓越的可扩展性优势。<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Although multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown its success across diverse domains, extending its application to large-scale real-world systems still faces significant challenges. Primarily, the high complexity of real-world environments exacerbates the credit assignment problem, substantially reducing training efficiency. Moreover, the variability of agent populations in large-scale scenarios necessitates scalable decision-making mechanisms. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework: Sequential rollout with Sequential value estimation (SrSv). This framework aims to capture agent interdependence and provide a scalable solution for cooperative MARL. Specifically, SrSv leverages the autoregressive property of the Transformer model to handle varying populations through sequential action rollout. Furthermore, to capture the interdependence of policy distributions and value functions among multiple agents, we introduce an innovative sequential value estimation methodology and integrates the value approximation into an attention-based sequential model. We evaluate SrSv on three benchmarks: Multi-Agent MuJoCo, StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, and DubinsCars. Experimental results demonstrate that SrSv significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of training efficiency without compromising convergence performance. Moreover, when implemented in a large-scale DubinsCar system with 1,024 agents, our framework surpasses existing benchmarks, highlighting the excellent scalability of SrSv.

Abstract: In recent research advancements within the community, large language models (LLMs) have sparked great interest in creating autonomous agents. However, current prompt-based agents often heavily rely on large-scale LLMs. Meanwhile, although fine-tuning methods significantly enhance the capabilities of smaller LLMs, the fine-tuned agents often lack the potential for self-reflection and self-improvement. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel agent framework named RetroAct, which is a framework that jointly optimizes both task-planning and self-reflective evolution capabilities in language agents. Specifically, we develop a two-stage joint optimization process that integrates imitation learning and reinforcement learning, and design an off-policy joint policy gradient optimization algorithm with imitation learning regularization to enhance the data efficiency and training stability in agent tasks. RetroAct significantly improves the performance of open-source models, reduces dependency on closed-source LLMs, and enables fine-tuned agents to learn and evolve continuously. We conduct extensive experiments across various testing environments, demonstrating RetroAct has substantial improvements in task performance and decision-making processes.

总结:
本文提出了一个名为SEmaNtically Sensible ExploratIon (SENSEI)的框架，旨在使模型基强化学习代理具备对语义上有意义行为的内在动机。与传统的基于信息增益的内在动机方法不同，SENSEI从视觉语言模型（VLM）注解中提炼出有趣性奖励信号，使代理能够通过世界模型预测这些奖励。通过使用模型基RL，SENSEI训练一个探索策略，该策略同时最大化语义奖励和不确定性。实验表明，在机器人和视频游戏般的模拟环境中，SENSEI能够从图像观测和低级动作中发现多种有意义的行为。SENSEI为从基础模型反馈中进行学习提供了一个通用工具，随着视觉语言模型变得更加强大，这一研究方向显得尤为重要。 <div>

Abstract: Exploration is a cornerstone of reinforcement learning (RL). Intrinsic motivation attempts to decouple exploration from external, task-based rewards. However, established approaches to intrinsic motivation that follow general principles such as information gain, often only uncover low-level interactions. In contrast, children's play suggests that they engage in meaningful high-level behavior by imitating or interacting with their caregivers. Recent work has focused on using foundation models to inject these semantic biases into exploration. However, these methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions, such as language-embedded environments or access to high-level actions. We propose SEmaNtically Sensible ExploratIon (SENSEI), a framework to equip model-based RL agents with an intrinsic motivation for semantically meaningful behavior. SENSEI distills a reward signal of interestingness from Vision Language Model (VLM) annotations, enabling an agent to predict these rewards through a world model. Using model-based RL, SENSEI trains an exploration policy that jointly maximizes semantic rewards and uncertainty. We show that in both robotic and video game-like simulations SENSEI discovers a variety of meaningful behaviors from image observations and low-level actions. SENSEI provides a general tool for learning from foundation model feedback, a crucial research direction, as VLMs become more powerful.

Abstract: As a popular form of science communication, science stories attract readers because they combine engaging narratives with comprehensible scientific knowledge. However, crafting such stories requires substantial skill and effort, as writers must navigate complex scientific concepts and transform them into coherent and accessible narratives tailored to audiences with varying levels of scientific literacy. To address the challenge, we propose RevTogether, a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support revision of science stories with human-like AI agents (using GPT-4o). RevTogether allows AI agents to simulate affects in addition to providing comments and writing suggestions, while offering varying degrees of user agency. Our preliminary user study with non-expert writers (N=3) highlighted the need for transparency in AI agents' decision-making processes to support learning and suggested that emotional interactions could enhance human-AI collaboration in science storytelling.

Abstract: Modern front-end (FE) development, especially when leveraging the unique features of frameworks like React and Vue, presents distinctive challenges. These include managing modular architectures, ensuring synchronization between data and visual outputs for declarative rendering, and adapting reusable components to various scenarios. Such complexities make it particularly difficult for state-of-the-art large vision-language models (VLMs) to generate accurate and functional code directly from design images. To address these challenges, we propose a reflective agentic workflow that synthesizes high-quality image-text data to capture the diverse characteristics of FE development. This workflow automates the extraction of self-contained\footnote{A \textbf{self-contained} code snippet is one that encapsulates all necessary logic, styling, and dependencies, ensuring it functions independently without requiring external imports or context.} code snippets from real-world projects, renders the corresponding visual outputs, and generates detailed descriptions that link design elements to functional code. To further expand the scope and utility of the synthesis, we introduce three data synthesis strategies: Evolution-based synthesis, which enables scalable and diverse dataset expansion; Waterfall-Model-based synthesis, which generates logically coherent code derived from system requirements; and Additive Development synthesis, which iteratively increases the complexity of human-authored components. We build a large vision-language model, Flame, trained on the synthesized datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in generating React code via the $\text{pass}@k$ metric. Our results suggest that a code VLM trained to interpret images before code generation may achieve better performance.

Abstract: Integrating LLM models into educational practice fosters personalized learning by accommodating the diverse behavioral patterns of different learner types. This study aims to explore these learner types within a novel interactive setting, providing a detailed analysis of their distinctive characteristics and interaction dynamics. The research involved 110 students from a university in China, who engaged with multiple LLM agents in an LLM-empowered learning environment, completing coursework across six modules. Data on the students' non-cognitive traits, course engagement, and AI interaction patterns were collected and analyzed. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, the students were classified into three distinct groups: active questioners, responsive navigators, and silent listeners. Epistemic network analysis was then applied to further delineate the interaction profiles and cognitive engagement of different types of learners. The findings underscore how different learner types engage with human-AI interactive learning and offer practical implications for the design of adaptive educational systems.

该论文提出了一种针对具有分段线性奖励函数的在线学习通用框架，这些函数常见于微观经济模型中，如隐藏行动的委托代理问题、定价销售和第一价格拍卖。在参数未知且由某些概率分布决定的情况下，学习如何优化未知且随机的分段线性奖励函数成为问题。新框架在满足适当的单调性假设条件下，设计了一个学习算法，其可以获得$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{nT})$的遗憾值，其中$n$为奖励函数的“片段”数量，$T$为轮数。当$n$相对于$T$较小（即$n\leq T^{1/3}$）时，这个结果是紧致的。该算法解决了文献中的两个开放问题：一是对于隐藏行动委托代理问题中学习最优线性合同，证明了Zhu等人[Zhu+23]得到的$\widetilde{O}(T^{2/3})$遗憾界在动作数量小的情况下的不严格性；二是展示了在定价拍卖的学习定价问题中可以实现合适的实例无关遗憾界限，从而回答了Cesa-Bianchi等人[CBCP19]提出的开放问题。 <div>

Abstract: Most microeconomic models of interest involve optimizing a piecewise linear function. These include contract design in hidden-action principal-agent problems, selling an item in posted-price auctions, and bidding in first-price auctions. When the relevant model parameters are unknown and determined by some (unknown) probability distributions, the problem becomes learning how to optimize an unknown and stochastic piecewise linear reward function. Such a problem is usually framed within an online learning framework, where the decision-maker (learner) seeks to minimize the regret of not knowing an optimal decision in hindsight. This paper introduces a general online learning framework that offers a unified approach to tackle regret minimization for piecewise linear rewards, under a suitable monotonicity assumption commonly satisfied by microeconomic models. We design a learning algorithm that attains a regret of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{nT})$, where $n$ is the number of ``pieces'' of the reward function and $T$ is the number of rounds. This result is tight when $n$ is \emph{small} relative to $T$, specifically when $n \leq T^{1/3}$. Our algorithm solves two open problems in the literature on learning in microeconomic settings. First, it shows that the $\widetilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret bound obtained by Zhu et al. [Zhu+23] for learning optimal linear contracts in hidden-action principal-agent problems is not tight when the number of agent's actions is small relative to $T$. Second, our algorithm demonstrates that, in the problem of learning to set prices in posted-price auctions, it is possible to attain suitable (and desirable) instance-independent regret bounds, addressing an open problem posed by Cesa-Bianchi et al. [CBCP19].

Abstract: In this paper, we adapt a two species agent-based cancer model that describes the interaction between cancer cells and healthy cells on a uniform grid to include the interaction with a third species -- namely immune cells. We run six different scenarios to explore the competition between cancer and immune cells and the initial concentration of the immune cells on cancer dynamics. We then use coupled equation learning to construct a population-based reaction model for each scenario. We show how they can be unified into a single surrogate population-based reaction model, whose underlying three coupled ordinary differential equations are much easier to analyse than the original agent-based model. As an example, by finding the single steady state of the cancer concentration, we are able to find a linear relationship between this concentration and the initial concentration of the immune cells. This then enables us to estimate suitable values for the competition and initial concentration to reduce the cancer substantially without performing additional complex and expensive simulations from an agent-based stochastic model. The work shows the importance of performing equation learning from agent-based stochastic data for gaining key insights about the behaviour of complex cellular dynamics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers powerful techniques for solving complex sequential decision-making tasks from experience. In this paper, we demonstrate how RL can be applied to adversarial machine learning (AML) to develop a new class of attacks that learn to generate adversarial examples: inputs designed to fool machine learning models. Unlike traditional AML methods that craft adversarial examples independently, our RL-based approach retains and exploits past attack experience to improve future attacks. We formulate adversarial example generation as a Markov Decision Process and evaluate RL's ability to (a) learn effective and efficient attack strategies and (b) compete with state-of-the-art AML. On CIFAR-10, our agent increases the success rate of adversarial examples by 19.4% and decreases the median number of victim model queries per adversarial example by 53.2% from the start to the end of training. In a head-to-head comparison with a state-of-the-art image attack, SquareAttack, our approach enables an adversary to generate adversarial examples with 13.1% more success after 5000 episodes of training. From a security perspective, this work demonstrates a powerful new attack vector that uses RL to attack ML models efficiently and at scale.

Abstract: Tool learning aims to augment large language models (LLMs) with diverse tools, enabling them to act as agents for solving practical tasks. Due to the limited context length of tool-using LLMs, adopting information retrieval (IR) models to select useful tools from large toolsets is a critical initial step. However, the performance of IR models in tool retrieval tasks remains underexplored and unclear. Most tool-use benchmarks simplify this step by manually pre-annotating a small set of relevant tools for each task, which is far from the real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ToolRet, a heterogeneous tool retrieval benchmark comprising 7.6k diverse retrieval tasks, and a corpus of 43k tools, collected from existing datasets. We benchmark six types of models on ToolRet. Surprisingly, even the models with strong performance in conventional IR benchmarks, exhibit poor performance on ToolRet. This low retrieval quality degrades the task pass rate of tool-use LLMs. As a further step, we contribute a large-scale training dataset with over 200k instances, which substantially optimizes the tool retrieval ability of IR models.

Abstract: We introduce AutoAdvExBench, a benchmark to evaluate if large language models (LLMs) can autonomously exploit defenses to adversarial examples. Unlike existing security benchmarks that often serve as proxies for real-world tasks, bench directly measures LLMs' success on tasks regularly performed by machine learning security experts. This approach offers a significant advantage: if a LLM could solve the challenges presented in bench, it would immediately present practical utility for adversarial machine learning researchers. We then design a strong agent that is capable of breaking 75% of CTF-like ("homework exercise") adversarial example defenses. However, we show that this agent is only able to succeed on 13% of the real-world defenses in our benchmark, indicating the large gap between difficulty in attacking "real" code, and CTF-like code. In contrast, a stronger LLM that can attack 21% of real defenses only succeeds on 54% of CTF-like defenses. We make this benchmark available at https://github.com/ethz-spylab/AutoAdvExBench.

<div> 关键词：大规模语言模型 (LLMs)、说服力、Persuade Me If You Can (PMIYC)、多代理交互、人类评价

总结:
这篇论文介绍了研究大规模语言模型（LLMs）说服力及对伦理原则遵循情况的新框架——Persuade Me If You Can (PMIYC)。该框架通过多轮对话评估LLMs的说服能力和易受说服的程度。论文进行了全面评估，涉及多种LLMs并在主观和错误信息情境中进行对比。通过与人工评价的对比，验证了框架的有效性。PMIYC提供了一种可扩展的人工标注替代方案，用于研究LLMs中的说服现象。实验结果显示，Llama-3.3-70B和GPT-4o在说服效果上相当，但GPT-4o对于错误信息的抵抗说服力比Llama-3.3-70B高出超过50%。这些发现为理解LLMs的说服动态提供了实证见解，有助于开发更安全的人工智能系统。 <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate persuasive capabilities that rival human-level persuasion. While these capabilities can be used for social good, they also present risks of potential misuse. Moreover, LLMs' susceptibility to persuasion raises concerns about alignment with ethical principles. To study these dynamics, we introduce Persuade Me If You Can (PMIYC), an automated framework for evaluating persuasion through multi-agent interactions. Here, Persuader agents engage in multi-turn conversations with the Persuadee agents, allowing us to measure LLMs' persuasive effectiveness and their susceptibility to persuasion. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across diverse LLMs, ensuring each model is assessed against others in both subjective and misinformation contexts. We validate the efficacy of our framework through human evaluations and show alignment with prior work. PMIYC offers a scalable alternative to human annotation for studying persuasion in LLMs. Through PMIYC, we find that Llama-3.3-70B and GPT-4o exhibit similar persuasive effectiveness, outperforming Claude 3 Haiku by 30%. However, GPT-4o demonstrates over 50% greater resistance to persuasion for misinformation compared to Llama-3.3-70B. These findings provide empirical insights into the persuasive dynamics of LLMs and contribute to the development of safer AI systems.

<br /><br />总结:
该研究探索了大型语言模型（LLM）在更生态化、无约束条件下的说服力，包括静态（书面段落）和动态（通过Telegram进行对话）两种交互方式。这项预注册的研究以希伯来语为语言环境，共有200名参与者，考察了LLM与人类对话者在争议性公民政策话题上的说服效果。结果显示，参与者对LLM和人类观点的采纳程度相似，并在所有条件下都显示出明显的观点变化，不论对话者类型或交互模式如何。在大多数情况下，参与者的信心水平显著提高，但在静态的LLM交互中除外。这些发现表明，LLM基的对话代理在不同来源和设置下具有强大的说服力，可能对塑造公众意见产生重大影响。 <div>

Abstract: The increasing integration of large language model (LLM) based conversational agents into everyday life raises critical cognitive and social questions about their potential to influence human opinions. Although previous studies have shown that LLM-based agents can generate persuasive content, these typically involve controlled, English-language settings. Addressing this, our preregistered study explored LLM's persuasive capabilities in more ecological, unconstrained scenarios, examining both static (written paragraphs) and dynamic (conversations via Telegram) interaction types. Conducted entirely in Hebrew with 200 participants, the study assessed the persuasive effects of both LLM and human interlocutors on controversial civil policy topics. Results indicated that participants adopted LLM and human perspectives similarly, with significant opinion changes evident across all conditions, regardless of interlocutor type or interaction mode. Confidence levels increased significantly in most scenarios, except in static LLM interactions. These findings demonstrate LLM-based agents' robust persuasive capabilities across diverse sources and settings, highlighting their potential impact on shaping public opinions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents show great promise in accelerating scientific research. Existing benchmarks for measuring this potential and guiding future development continue to evolve from pure recall and rote knowledge tasks, towards more practical work such as literature review and experimental planning. Bioinformatics is a domain where fully autonomous AI-driven discovery may be near, but no extensive benchmarks for measuring progress have been introduced to date. We therefore present the Bioinformatics Benchmark (BixBench), a dataset comprising over 50 real-world scenarios of practical biological data analysis with nearly 300 associated open-answer questions designed to measure the ability of LLM-based agents to explore biological datasets, perform long, multi-step analytical trajectories, and interpret the nuanced results of those analyses. We evaluate the performance of two frontier LLMs (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) using a custom agent framework we open source. We find that even the latest frontier models only achieve 17% accuracy in the open-answer regime, and no better than random in a multiple-choice setting. By exposing the current limitations of frontier models, we hope BixBench can spur the development of agents capable of conducting rigorous bioinformatic analysis and accelerate scientific discovery.

Abstract: Bilateral markets, such as those for government bonds, involve decentralized and opaque transactions between market makers (MMs) and clients, posing significant challenges for traditional modeling approaches. To address these complexities, we introduce TRIBE an agent-based model augmented with a large language model (LLM) to simulate human-like decision-making in trading environments. TRIBE leverages publicly available data and stylized facts to capture realistic trading dynamics, integrating human biases like risk aversion and ambiguity sensitivity into the decision-making processes of agents. Our research yields three key contributions: first, we demonstrate that integrating LLMs into agent-based models to enhance client agency is feasible and enriches the simulation of agent behaviors in complex markets; second, we find that even slight trade aversion encoded within the LLM leads to a complete cessation of trading activity, highlighting the sensitivity of market dynamics to agents' risk profiles; third, we show that incorporating human-like variability shifts power dynamics towards clients and can disproportionately affect the entire system, often resulting in systemic agent collapse across simulations. These findings underscore the emergent properties that arise when introducing stochastic, human-like decision processes, revealing new system behaviors that enhance the realism and complexity of artificial societies.

<div> 关键词: 内部模型原则、控制理论、认知科学、Bayesian处理、Markov类别

总结:
这篇文章探讨了内部模型原则，该原则最初在线性系统控制理论中提出，现在在更广泛的控制论和 cybernetics 领域有重要应用。文章首先回顾了内部模型原则并借用范畴系统理论的概念给出了精确的表述，从而定义了一个概括性的“模型”概念。虽然这个“模型”概念与认知科学中的Bayesian推理所涉及的内部模型并非先天相关，但作者表明它可以被视为可能性Bayesian滤波的一种特殊情况。这一结论基于最近利用Markov类别形式化“解释”的研究，即当一个系统可以被解释为以一致的方式对外界环境执行Bayesian过滤操作时。 <div>
arXiv:2503.00511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The internal model principle, originally proposed in the theory of control of linear systems, nowadays represents a more general class of results in control theory and cybernetics. The central claim of these results is that, under suitable assumptions, if a system (a controller) can regulate against a class of external inputs (from the environment), it is because the system contains a model of the system causing these inputs, which can be used to generate signals counteracting them. Similar claims on the role of internal models appear also in cognitive science, especially in modern Bayesian treatments of cognitive agents, often suggesting that a system (a human subject, or some other agent) models its environment to adapt against disturbances and perform goal-directed behaviour. It is however unclear whether the Bayesian internal models discussed in cognitive science bear any formal relation to the internal models invoked in standard treatments of control theory. Here, we first review the internal model principle and present a precise formulation of it using concepts inspired by categorical systems theory. This leads to a formal definition of `model' generalising its use in the internal model principle. Although this notion of model is not a priori related to the notion of Bayesian reasoning, we show that it can be seen as a special case of possibilistic Bayesian filtering. This result is based on a recent line of work formalising, using Markov categories, a notion of `interpretation', describing when a system can be interpreted as performing Bayesian filtering on an outside world in a consistent way.

Abstract: Next-generation instruments for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy are marked by a substantial increase in complexity, featuring dozens of telescopes. This leap in scale introduces significant challenges in managing system operations and offline data analysis. Methods, which depend on advanced personnel training and sophisticated software, become increasingly strained as system complexity grows, making it more challenging to effectively support users in such a multifaceted environment. To address these challenges, we propose the development of AI agents based on instruction-finetuned large language models (LLMs). These agents align with specific documentation and codebases, understand the environmental context, operate with external APIs, and communicate with humans in natural language. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of modern LLMs, which can process and retain vast amounts of information, these AI agents offer a transformative approach to system management and data analysis by automating complex tasks and providing intelligent assistance. We present two prototypes that integrate with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory pipelines for operations and offline data analysis. The first prototype automates data model implementation and maintenance for the Configuration Database of the Array Control and Data Acquisition (ACADA). The second prototype is an open-access code generation application tailored for data analysis based on the Gammapy framework.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) is crucial for tumor detection and diagnosis, but the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) in clinical settings raises safety concerns due to potential health risks. To circumvent these issues while preserving diagnostic accuracy, we propose a novel Transformer with Localization Prompts (TLP) framework for synthesizing CE-MRI from non-contrast MR images. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: a hierarchical backbone that uses efficient Transformer to process multi-scale features; a multi-stage fusion system consisting of Local and Global Fusion modules that hierarchically integrate complementary information via spatial attention operations and cross-attention mechanisms, respectively; and a Fuzzy Prompt Generation (FPG) module that enhances the TLP model's generalization by emulating radiologists' manual annotation through stochastic feature perturbation. The framework uniquely enables interactive clinical integration by allowing radiologists to input diagnostic prompts during inference, synergizing artificial intelligence with medical expertise. This research establishes a new paradigm for contrast-free MRI synthesis while addressing critical clinical needs for safer diagnostic procedures.

总结:
本文研究了在线强化学习在受到时间变化外部上下文影响的非平稳环境中的应用。在这种环境中，由于“灾难性遗忘”现象，智能体容易忘记先前的知识。现有的缓解方法通常假设具有任务标签（而实践中往往不可得）、使用易碎的正则化启发式策略或采用不稳定的离线策略优化方法。为此，文章提出了一种名为局部约束策略优化（LCPO）的在线RL方法，它通过将策略输出锚定在旧经验上，同时优化当前经验上的回报来进行对抗灾难性遗忘。LCPO利用来自当前上下文分布之外的经验样本对策略优化进行局部约束。实验结果表明，LCPO在Mujoco、经典控制和计算机系统环境中，针对各种合成与真实上下文轨迹的非平稳设置下，优于多种基线方法，同时其性能可以与一种具有先见之明的、在所有上下文轨迹上离线训练的智能体相媲美。LCPO的源代码已公开发布在https://github.com/pouyahmdn/LCPO。 <div>

Abstract: We study online reinforcement learning (RL) in non-stationary environments, where a time-varying exogenous context process affects the environment dynamics. Online RL is challenging in such environments due to "catastrophic forgetting" (CF). The agent tends to forget prior knowledge as it trains on new experiences. Prior approaches to mitigate this issue assume task labels (which are often not available in practice), employ brittle regularization heuristics or use off-policy methods that suffer from instability and poor performance.
  We present Locally Constrained Policy Optimization (LCPO), an online RL approach that combats CF by anchoring policy outputs on old experiences while optimizing the return on current experiences. To perform this anchoring, LCPO locally constrains policy optimization using samples from experiences that lie outside of the current context distribution. We evaluate LCPO in Mujoco, classic control and computer systems environments with a variety of synthetic and real context traces, and find that it outperforms a variety of baselines in the non-stationary setting, while achieving results on-par with a "prescient" agent trained offline across all context traces.

Abstract: Parameter sharing, as an important technique in multi-agent systems, can effectively solve the scalability issue in large-scale agent problems. However, the effectiveness of parameter sharing largely depends on the environment setting. When agents have different identities or tasks, naive parameter sharing makes it difficult to generate sufficiently differentiated strategies for agents. Inspired by research pertaining to the brain in biology, we propose a novel parameter sharing method. It maps each type of agent to different regions within a shared network based on their identity, resulting in distinct subnetworks. Therefore, our method can increase the diversity of strategies among different agents without introducing additional training parameters. Through experiments conducted in multiple environments, our method has shown better performance than other parameter sharing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for reinforcement learning (RL) models, such as planning and reasoning capabilities. However, the problems of LLMs and RL model collaboration still need to be solved. In this study, we employ a teacher-student learning framework to tackle these problems, specifically by offering feedback for LLMs using RL models and providing high-level information for RL models with LLMs in a cooperative multi-agent setting. Within this framework, the LLM acts as a teacher, while the RL model acts as a student. The two agents cooperatively assist each other through a process of recursive help, such as "I help you help I help." The LLM agent supplies abstract information to the RL agent, enabling efficient exploration and policy improvement. In turn, the RL agent offers feedback to the LLM agent, providing valuable, real-time information that helps generate more useful tokens. This bi-directional feedback loop promotes optimization, exploration, and mutual improvement for both agents, enabling them to accomplish increasingly challenging tasks. Remarkably, we propose a practical algorithm to address the problem and conduct empirical experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: How can agents exchange information to learn while protecting privacy? Healthcare centers collaborating on clinical trials must balance knowledge sharing with safeguarding sensitive patient data. We address this challenge by using differential privacy (DP) to control information leakage. Agents update belief statistics via log-linear rules, and DP noise provides plausible deniability and rigorous performance guarantees. We study two settings: distributed maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with a finite set of private signals and online learning from an intermittent signal stream. Noisy aggregation introduces trade-offs between rejecting low-quality states and accepting high-quality ones. The MLE setting naturally applies to binary hypothesis testing with formal statistical guarantees. Through simulations, we demonstrate differentially private, distributed survival analysis on real-world clinical trial data, evaluating treatment efficacy and the impact of biomedical indices on patient survival. Our methods enable privacy-preserving inference with greater efficiency and lower error rates than homomorphic encryption and first-order DP optimization approaches.

Abstract: Spreadsheets are ubiquitous across the World Wide Web, playing a critical role in enhancing work efficiency across various domains. Large language model (LLM) has been recently attempted for automatic spreadsheet manipulation but has not yet been investigated in complicated and realistic tasks where reasoning challenges exist (e.g., long horizon manipulation with multi-step reasoning and ambiguous requirements). To bridge the gap with the real-world requirements, we introduce SheetRM, a benchmark featuring long-horizon and multi-category tasks with reasoning-dependent manipulation caused by real-life challenges. To mitigate the above challenges, we further propose SheetAgent, a novel autonomous agent that utilizes the power of LLMs. SheetAgent consists of three collaborative modules: Planner, Informer, and Retriever, achieving both advanced reasoning and accurate manipulation over spreadsheets without human interaction through iterative task reasoning and reflection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SheetAgent delivers 20--40\% pass rate improvements on multiple benchmarks over baselines, achieving enhanced precision in spreadsheet manipulation and demonstrating superior table reasoning abilities. More details and visualizations are available at the project website: https://sheetagent.github.io/. The datasets and source code are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SheetAgent.

总结:
本文首次研究了合作型多智能体强化学习（Cooperative MARL）中可证明有效的随机探索策略。文章提出了一种用于并行马尔科夫决策过程（MDPs）的统一随机探索算法框架，并设计了两种Thompson采样类型的算法——CoopTS-PHE和CoopTS-LMC，分别结合了扰动历史探索（PHE）策略和朗之万蒙特卡洛探索（LMC）策略，这两个算法具有设计灵活和易于实践应用的特点。针对一类过渡模型近似线性的特殊并行MDPs，理论上证明了CoopTS-PHE和CoopTS-LMC可以达到$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}H^2\sqrt{MK})$的遗憾界以及$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(dHM^2)$的通信复杂度，其中$d$为特征维度，$H$为时间步长，$M$为智能体数量，$K$为episode数。这是合作型MARL中首个关于随机探索的理论结果。实验结果显示，所提方法在多个并行RL环境中表现出色，包括深搜索问题（如N-chain）、视频游戏以及实际能源系统问题，并且在转移模型不准确的情况下仍能取得良好表现。此外，文中还建立了提出的统一框架与联邦学习的实际应用之间的联系。 <div>

Abstract: We present the first study on provably efficient randomized exploration in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We propose a unified algorithm framework for randomized exploration in parallel Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and two Thompson Sampling (TS)-type algorithms, CoopTS-PHE and CoopTS-LMC, incorporating the perturbed-history exploration (PHE) strategy and the Langevin Monte Carlo exploration (LMC) strategy, respectively, which are flexible in design and easy to implement in practice. For a special class of parallel MDPs where the transition is (approximately) linear, we theoretically prove that both CoopTS-PHE and CoopTS-LMC achieve a $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}H^2\sqrt{MK})$ regret bound with communication complexity $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(dHM^2)$, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ is the horizon length, $M$ is the number of agents, and $K$ is the number of episodes. This is the first theoretical result for randomized exploration in cooperative MARL. We evaluate our proposed method on multiple parallel RL environments, including a deep exploration problem (i.e., $N$-chain), a video game, and a real-world problem in energy systems. Our experimental results support that our framework can achieve better performance, even under conditions of misspecified transition models. Additionally, we establish a connection between our unified framework and the practical application of federated learning.

Abstract: Embodied AI is widely recognized as a key element of artificial general intelligence because it involves controlling embodied agents to perform tasks in the physical world. Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple large language model (LLM) agents has shown to be a promising approach for tackling complex tasks, while the effective design of multiple agents for a particular application remains an art. It is thus intriguing to answer a critical question: Given a task, how can we build a team of LLM agents to solve it effectively? Our new adaptive team-building paradigm offers a flexible solution, realized through a novel agent design named Captain Agent. It dynamically forms and manages teams for each step of a task-solving process, utilizing nested group conversations and reflection to ensure diverse expertise and prevent stereotypical outputs, allowing for a flexible yet structured approach to problem-solving. A comprehensive evaluation across six real-world scenarios demonstrates that Captain Agent significantly outperforms existing multi-agent methods with 21.94% improvement in average accuracy, providing outstanding performance without requiring task-specific prompt engineering. Our exploration of different backbone LLM and cost analysis further shows that Captain Agent can improve the conversation quality of weak LLM and achieve competitive performance with extremely low cost, which illuminates the application of multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Automated parking stands as a highly anticipated application of autonomous driving technology. However, existing path planning methodologies fall short of addressing this need due to their incapability to handle the diverse and complex parking scenarios in reality. While non-learning methods provide reliable planning results, they are vulnerable to intricate occasions, whereas learning-based ones are good at exploration but unstable in converging to feasible solutions. To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we introduce Hybrid pOlicy Path plannEr (HOPE). This novel solution integrates a reinforcement learning agent with Reeds-Shepp curves, enabling effective planning across diverse scenarios. HOPE guides the exploration of the reinforcement learning agent by applying an action mask mechanism and employs a transformer to integrate the perceived environmental information with the mask. To facilitate the training and evaluation of the proposed planner, we propose a criterion for categorizing the difficulty level of parking scenarios based on space and obstacle distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms typical rule-based algorithms and traditional reinforcement learning methods, showing higher planning success rates and generalization across various scenarios. We also conduct real-world experiments to verify the practicability of HOPE. The code for our solution is openly available on https://github.com/jiamiya/HOPE.

Abstract: Skill discovery methods enable agents to learn diverse emergent behaviors without explicit rewards. To make learned skills useful for unknown downstream tasks, obtaining a semantically diverse repertoire of skills is essential. While some approaches introduce a discriminator to distinguish skills and others aim to increase state coverage, no existing work directly addresses the "semantic diversity" of skills. We hypothesize that leveraging the semantic knowledge of large language models (LLMs) can lead us to improve semantic diversity of resulting behaviors. In this sense, we introduce Language Guided Skill Discovery (LGSD), a skill discovery framework that aims to directly maximize the semantic diversity between skills. LGSD takes user prompts as input and outputs a set of semantically distinctive skills. The prompts serve as a means to constrain the search space into a semantically desired subspace, and the generated LLM outputs guide the agent to visit semantically diverse states within the subspace. We demonstrate that LGSD enables legged robots to visit different user-intended areas on a plane by simply changing the prompt. Furthermore, we show that language guidance aids in discovering more diverse skills compared to five existing skill discovery methods in robot-arm manipulation environments. Lastly, LGSD provides a simple way of utilizing learned skills via natural language.

Abstract: Identifying underlying user goals and intents has been recognized as valuable in various personalization-oriented settings, such as personalized agents, improved search responses, advertising, user analytics, and more. In this paper, we propose a new task goal identification from observed UI trajectories aiming to infer the user's detailed intentions when performing a task within UI environments. To support this task, we also introduce a novel evaluation methodology designed to assess whether two intent descriptions can be considered paraphrases within a specific UI environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this task can leverage datasets designed for the inverse problem of UI automation, utilizing Android and web datasets for our experiments. To benchmark this task, we compare the performance of humans and state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 Pro, using our proposed metric. The results reveal that both Gemini and GPT underperform relative to human performance, underscoring the challenge of the proposed task and the significant room for improvement. This work highlights the importance of goal identification within UI trajectories, providing a foundation for further exploration and advancement in this area.

Abstract: As Fifth generation (5G) cellular systems transition to softwarized, programmable, and intelligent networks, it becomes fundamental to enable public and private 5G deployments that are (i) primarily based on software components while (ii) maintaining or exceeding the performance of traditional monolithic systems and (iii) enabling programmability through bespoke configurations and optimized deployments. This requires hardware acceleration to scale the Physical (PHY) layer performance, programmable elements in the Radio Access Network (RAN) and intelligent controllers at the edge, careful planning of the Radio Frequency (RF) environment, as well as end-to-end integration and testing. In this paper, we describe how we developed the programmable X5G testbed, addressing these challenges through the deployment of the first 8-node network based on the integration of NVIDIA Aerial RAN CoLab Over-the-Air (ARC-OTA), OpenAirInterface (OAI), and a near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). The Aerial Software Development Kit (SDK) provides the PHY layer, accelerated on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), with the higher layers from the OAI open-source project interfaced with the PHY through the Small Cell Forum (SCF) Functional Application Platform Interface (FAPI). An E2 agent provides connectivity to the O-RAN Software Community (OSC) near-real-time RIC. We discuss software integration, network infrastructure, and a digital twin framework for RF planning. We then profile the performance with up to 4 Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) smartphones for each base station with iPerf and video streaming applications, as well as up to 25 emulated User Equipments (UEs), measuring a cell rate higher than 1.65 Gbps in downlink and 143 Mbps in uplink.

Abstract: Intelligent perception and interaction with the world hinges on internal representations that capture its underlying structure (''disentangled'' or ''abstract'' representations). Disentangled representations serve as world models, isolating latent factors of variation in the world along approximately orthogonal directions, thus facilitating feature-based generalization. We provide experimental and theoretical results guaranteeing the emergence of disentangled representations in agents that optimally solve multi-task evidence accumulation classification tasks, canonical in the neuroscience literature. The key conceptual finding is that, by producing accurate multi-task classification estimates, a system implicitly represents a set of coordinates specifying a disentangled representation of the underlying latent state of the data it receives. The theory provides conditions for the emergence of these representations in terms of noise, number of tasks, and evidence accumulation time. We experimentally validate these predictions in RNNs trained to multi-task, which learn disentangled representations in the form of continuous attractors, leading to zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in predicting latent factors. We demonstrate the robustness of our framework across autoregressive architectures, decision boundary geometries and in tasks requiring classification confidence estimation. We find that transformers are particularly suited for disentangling representations, which might explain their unique world understanding abilities. Overall, our framework establishes a formal link between competence at multiple tasks and the formation of disentangled, interpretable world models in both biological and artificial systems, and helps explain why ANNs often arrive at human-interpretable concepts, and how they both may acquire exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has recently excelled in solving challenging cooperative and competitive multi-agent problems in various environments, typically involving a small number of agents and full observability. Moreover, a range of crucial robotics-related tasks, such as multi-robot pathfinding, which have traditionally been approached with classical non-learnable methods (e.g., heuristic search), are now being suggested for solution using learning-based or hybrid methods. However, in this domain, it remains difficult, if not impossible, to conduct a fair comparison between classical, learning-based, and hybrid approaches due to the lack of a unified framework that supports both learning and evaluation. To address this, we introduce POGEMA, a comprehensive set of tools that includes a fast environment for learning, a problem instance generator, a collection of predefined problem instances, a visualization toolkit, and a benchmarking tool for automated evaluation. We also introduce and define an evaluation protocol that specifies a range of domain-related metrics, computed based on primary evaluation indicators (such as success rate and path length), enabling a fair multi-fold comparison. The results of this comparison, which involves a variety of state-of-the-art MARL, search-based, and hybrid methods, are presented.

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to develop and validate an evaluation framework to ensure the safety and reliability of mental health chatbots, which are increasingly popular due to their accessibility, human-like interactions, and context-aware support. Materials and Methods: We created an evaluation framework with 100 benchmark questions and ideal responses, and five guideline questions for chatbot responses. This framework, validated by mental health experts, was tested on a GPT-3.5-turbo-based chatbot. Automated evaluation methods explored included large language model (LLM)-based scoring, an agentic approach using real-time data, and embedding models to compare chatbot responses against ground truth standards. Results: The results highlight the importance of guidelines and ground truth for improving LLM evaluation accuracy. The agentic method, dynamically accessing reliable information, demonstrated the best alignment with human assessments. Adherence to a standardized, expert-validated framework significantly enhanced chatbot response safety and reliability. Discussion: Our findings emphasize the need for comprehensive, expert-tailored safety evaluation metrics for mental health chatbots. While LLMs have significant potential, careful implementation is necessary to mitigate risks. The superior performance of the agentic approach underscores the importance of real-time data access in enhancing chatbot reliability. Conclusion: The study validated an evaluation framework for mental health chatbots, proving its effectiveness in improving safety and reliability. Future work should extend evaluations to accuracy, bias, empathy, and privacy to ensure holistic assessment and responsible integration into healthcare. Standardized evaluations will build trust among users and professionals, facilitating broader adoption and improved mental health support through technology.

Abstract: Researchers are investing substantial effort in developing powerful general-purpose agents, wherein Foundation Models are used as modules within agentic systems (e.g. Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, Toolformer). However, the history of machine learning teaches us that hand-designed solutions are eventually replaced by learned solutions. We describe a newly forming research area, Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS), which aims to automatically create powerful agentic system designs, including inventing novel building blocks and/or combining them in new ways. We further demonstrate that there is an unexplored yet promising approach within ADAS where agents can be defined in code and new agents can be automatically discovered by a meta agent programming ever better ones in code. Given that programming languages are Turing Complete, this approach theoretically enables the learning of any possible agentic system: including novel prompts, tool use, workflows, and combinations thereof. We present a simple yet effective algorithm named Meta Agent Search to demonstrate this idea, where a meta agent iteratively programs interesting new agents based on an ever-growing archive of previous discoveries. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains including coding, science, and math, we show that our algorithm can progressively invent agents with novel designs that greatly outperform state-of-the-art hand-designed agents. Importantly, we consistently observe the surprising result that agents invented by Meta Agent Search maintain superior performance even when transferred across domains and models, demonstrating their robustness and generality.

<br />
总结:
本文关注了由大型语言模型驱动的AI代理在各行各业中的广泛应用所带来的安全性问题，包括潜在的安全隐患、偏见、易受攻击性、透明度缺乏以及生成幻觉等问题。随着AI代理在关键行业领域的普及，强化其安全措施显得愈发重要。文章提出了三个增强AI系统安全性的框架：基于LLM的输入-输出过滤器、内置的安全代理和具有嵌入式安全检查的层级委托系统。通过实现实验框架并针对一组不安全的AI使用案例进行测试，评估了它们在减轻AI部署相关风险方面的有效性。研究结果表明，这些框架能够显著提升AI系统的安全性和防护能力，降低可能造成的有害行为或输出。这项工作为构建安全可靠的AI应用，特别是在自动化操作领域，做出了贡献，并为进一步制定确保AI代理在现实世界中负责任使用的强大保障措施奠定了基础。 <div>

Abstract: AI agents, specifically powered by large language models, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in various applications where precision and efficacy are necessary. However, these agents come with inherent risks, including the potential for unsafe or biased actions, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, lack of transparency, and tendency to generate hallucinations. As AI agents become more prevalent in critical sectors of the industry, the implementation of effective safety protocols becomes increasingly important. This paper addresses the critical need for safety measures in AI systems, especially ones that collaborate with human teams. We propose and evaluate three frameworks to enhance safety protocols in AI agent systems: an LLM-powered input-output filter, a safety agent integrated within the system, and a hierarchical delegation-based system with embedded safety checks. Our methodology involves implementing these frameworks and testing them against a set of unsafe agentic use cases, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with AI agent deployment. We conclude that these frameworks can significantly strengthen the safety and security of AI agent systems, minimizing potential harmful actions or outputs. Our work contributes to the ongoing effort to create safe and reliable AI applications, particularly in automated operations, and provides a foundation for developing robust guardrails to ensure the responsible use of AI agents in real-world applications.

<div> 关键词：多机器人导航、动态环境、带宽约束、智能背包(iKnap)、观测分享

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种针对带宽约束下动态环境中多机器人导航的新型最优通信方案——智能背包(iKnap)。该方案将多机器人通信建模为图中推断代理之间的信念传播，并将观察分享的组合优化问题形式化为0/1背包问题，其中每一对机器人的潜在通信被赋予决策效用并权衡其带宽成本。研究使用ROS2和Open Robotics Middleware Framework在模拟的具有人类工人的仓库环境中进行了评估。相比现有的基于广播的最优通信方案，iKnap在场景复杂性增加的情况下仍能显著提高导航性能，同时保持相似的运行时间，并更有效地利用分配的带宽和观测资源，特别是在资源极低和不确定性高的情况下。因此，论文认为，所提出的方案能够使多机器人团队在实际导航问题中的协作更加稳健可靠。 <div>

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation is increasingly crucial in various domains, including disaster response, autonomous vehicles, and warehouse and manufacturing automation. Robot teams often must operate in highly dynamic environments and under strict bandwidth constraints imposed by communication infrastructure, rendering effective observation sharing within the system a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel optimal communication scheme, Intelligent Knapsack (iKnap), for multi-robot navigation in dynamic environments under bandwidth constraints. We model multi-robot communication as belief propagation in a graph of inferential agents. We then formulate the combinatorial optimization for observation sharing as a 0/1 knapsack problem, where each potential pairwise communication between robots is assigned a decision-making utility to be weighed against its bandwidth cost, and the system has some cumulative bandwidth limit. We evaluate our approach in a simulated robotic warehouse with human workers using ROS2 and the Open Robotics Middleware Framework. Compared to state-of-the-art broadcast-based optimal communication schemes, iKnap yields significant improvements in navigation performance with respect to scenario complexity while maintaining a similar runtime. Furthermore, iKnap utilizes allocated bandwidth and observational resources more efficiently than existing approaches, especially in very low-resource and high-uncertainty settings. Based on these results, we claim that the proposed method enables more robust collaboration for multi-robot teams in real-world navigation problems.

<div> 关键词：预测、机器人行为、人类预测、第二秩序理论思维、离散潜在空间

<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了人类对机器人行为预测的理解与建模问题。基于近期的研究发现，人类倾向于通过预测其他智能体的高层次行为来推测其行动意图。为此，文章提出了一种采用第二秩序理论思维方法，使机器人能够估计人类对其行为的预测。该方法将人和机器人的最近轨迹嵌入到一个离散潜在空间中，其中每个元素代表一种特定的行为类型（如并线超车或保持在同一车道）。通过对这个潜在空间中的行为类型进行解码，可以得到与行为类型一致的状态空间向量场。实验结果初步证明了这种方法产生的高层次、粗略的机器人行为预测与实际人类预测相符。文章通过概念验证的模拟测试、对比真实用户预测以及在真实世界交互式驾驶数据集上的实验证明了这一假设的有效性。 <div>

Abstract: Humans interacting with robots often form predictions of what the robot will do next. For instance, based on the recent behavior of an autonomous car, a nearby human driver might predict that the car is going to remain in the same lane. It is important for the robot to understand the human's prediction for safe and seamless interaction: e.g., if the autonomous car knows the human thinks it is not merging -- but the autonomous car actually intends to merge -- then the car can adjust its behavior to prevent an accident. Prior works typically assume that humans make precise predictions of robot behavior. However, recent research on human-human prediction suggests the opposite: humans tend to approximate other agents by predicting their high-level behaviors. We apply this finding to develop a second-order theory of mind approach that enables robots to estimate how humans predict they will behave. To extract these high-level predictions directly from data, we embed the recent human and robot trajectories into a discrete latent space. Each element of this latent space captures a different type of behavior (e.g., merging in front of the human, remaining in the same lane) and decodes into a vector field across the state space that is consistent with the underlying behavior type. We hypothesize that our resulting high-level and course predictions of robot behavior will correspond to actual human predictions. We provide initial evidence in support of this hypothesis through proof-of-concept simulations, testing our method's predictions against those of real users, and experiments on a real-world interactive driving dataset.

Abstract: A significant aspiration of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to develop a generalist agent with high capabilities from large and heterogeneous datasets. However, prior approaches that scale offline RL either rely heavily on expert trajectories or struggle to generalize to diverse unseen tasks. Inspired by the excellent generalization of world model in conditional video generation, we explore the potential of image observation-based world model for scaling offline RL and enhancing generalization on novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce JOWA: Jointly-Optimized World-Action model, an offline model-based RL agent pretrained on multiple Atari games with 6 billion tokens data to learn general-purpose representation and decision-making ability. Our method jointly optimizes a world-action model through a shared transformer backbone, which stabilize temporal difference learning with large models during pretraining. Moreover, we propose a provably efficient and parallelizable planning algorithm to compensate for the Q-value estimation error and thus search out better policies. Experimental results indicate that our largest agent, with 150 million parameters, achieves 78.9% human-level performance on pretrained games using only 10% subsampled offline data, outperforming existing state-of-the-art large-scale offline RL baselines by 31.6% on averange. Furthermore, JOWA scales favorably with model capacity and can sample-efficiently transfer to novel games using only 5k offline fine-tuning data (approximately 4 trajectories) per game, demonstrating superior generalization. We will release codes and model weights at https://github.com/CJReinforce/JOWA

Abstract: We investigate the synthesis of policies for high-level agent programs expressed in Golog, a language based on situation calculus that incorporates nondeterministic programming constructs. Unlike traditional approaches for program realization that assume full agent control or rely on incremental search, we address scenarios where environmental nondeterminism significantly influences program outcomes. Our synthesis problem involves deriving a policy that successfully realizes a given Golog program while ensuring the satisfaction of a temporal specification, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf), across all possible environmental behaviors. By leveraging an expressive class of first-order action theories, we construct a finite game arena that encapsulates program executions and tracks the satisfaction of the temporal goal. A game-theoretic approach is employed to derive such a policy. Experimental results demonstrate this approach's feasibility in domains with unbounded objects and non-local effects. This work bridges agent programming and temporal logic synthesis, providing a framework for robust agent behavior in nondeterministic environments.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables robots to learn complex behaviors through interaction with the environment. However, due to the unrestricted nature of the learning algorithms, the resulting solutions are often brittle and appear unnatural. This is especially true for learning direct joint-level torque control, as inductive biases are difficult to integrate into the learning process. We propose an inductive bias for learning locomotion that is especially useful for torque control: latent actions learned from a small dataset of expert demonstrations. This prior allows the policy to directly leverage knowledge contained in the expert's actions and facilitates more efficient exploration. We observe that the agent is not restricted to the reward levels of the demonstration, and performance in transfer tasks is improved significantly. Latent action priors combined with style rewards for imitation lead to a closer replication of the expert's behavior.

总结:
本文关注于大型语言模型（LLMs）在文本推理上的局限性，并指出通过直接编码方式能更高效地解决一些基准任务。尽管GPT Code Interpreter和AutoGen等工具展示了将代码生成与执行结合以利用LLMs解决复杂问题的能力，但实验表明现有七种流行的方法在指导LLM进行单或多轮代码或文本生成方面均无最优解。研究发现了模型在处理不同复杂度任务及模型大小变化时选择使用代码还是文本推理的有趣模式，甚至存在反向规模效应现象。此外，LLM编写的代码结果并不总是优于采用文本推理的结果。为解决这些问题，文章提出了三种改进LLM代码/文本生成引导的方法，并对所有方法的成本和运行时间进行了深入探讨。作者认为，引导LLM代码/文本生成的问题对于未来的研究具有重要意义，还有很大的提升空间。项目页面、数据集和代码可在https://yongchao98.github.io/CodeSteer/上获取。 <div>

Abstract: While a lot of recent research focuses on enhancing the textual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by optimizing the multi-agent framework or reasoning chains, several benchmark tasks can be solved with 100\% success through direct coding, which is more scalable and avoids the computational overhead associated with textual iterating and searching. Textual reasoning has inherent limitations in solving tasks with challenges in math, logics, optimization, and searching, which is unlikely to be solved by simply scaling up the model and data size. The recently released OpenAI GPT Code Interpreter and multi-agent frameworks such as AutoGen have demonstrated remarkable proficiency of integrating code generation and execution to solve complex tasks using LLMs. However, based on our experiments on 7 existing popular methods for steering code/text generation in both single- and multi-turn settings with 14 tasks and 6 types of LLMs (including the new O1-preview), currently there is no optimal method to correctly steer LLMs to write code when needed. We discover some interesting patterns on when models use code vs. textual reasoning with the evolution to task complexity and model sizes, which even result in an astonishingly inverse scaling behavior. We also discover that results from LLM written code are not always better than using textual reasoning, even if the task could be solved through code. To mitigate the above issues, we propose three methods to better steer LLM code/text generation and achieve a notable improvement. The costs of token lengths and runtime are thoroughly discussed for all the methods. We believe the problem of steering LLM code/text generation is critical for future research and has much space for further improvement.

Abstract: Biomedical reasoning integrates structured, codified knowledge with tacit, experience-driven insights. Depending on the context, quantity, and nature of available evidence, researchers and clinicians use diverse strategies, including rule-based, prototype-based, and case-based reasoning. Effective medical AI models must handle this complexity while ensuring reliability and adaptability. We introduce KGARevion, a knowledge graph-based agent that answers knowledge-intensive questions. Upon receiving a query, KGARevion generates relevant triplets by leveraging the latent knowledge embedded in a large language model. It then verifies these triplets against a grounded knowledge graph, filtering out errors and retaining only accurate, contextually relevant information for the final answer. This multi-step process strengthens reasoning, adapts to different models of medical inference, and outperforms retrieval-augmented generation-based approaches that lack effective verification mechanisms. Evaluations on medical QA benchmarks show that KGARevion improves accuracy by over 5.2% over 15 models in handling complex medical queries. To further assess its effectiveness, we curated three new medical QA datasets with varying levels of semantic complexity, where KGARevion improved accuracy by 10.4%. The agent integrates with different LLMs and biomedical knowledge graphs for broad applicability across knowledge-intensive tasks. We evaluated KGARevion on AfriMed-QA, a newly introduced dataset focused on African healthcare, demonstrating its strong zero-shot generalization to underrepresented medical contexts.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are transforming the capabilities of graphical user interface (GUI) agents, facilitating their transition from controlled simulations to complex, real-world applications across various platforms. However, the effectiveness of these agents hinges on the robustness of their grounding capability. Current GUI agents predominantly utilize text-based representations such as HTML or accessibility trees, which, despite their utility, often introduce noise, incompleteness, and increased computational overhead. In this paper, we advocate a human-like embodiment for GUI agents that perceive the environment entirely visually and directly perform pixel-level operations on the GUI. The key is visual grounding models that can accurately map diverse referring expressions of GUI elements to their coordinates on the GUI across different platforms. We show that a simple recipe, which includes web-based synthetic data and slight adaptation of the LLaVA architecture, is surprisingly effective for training such visual grounding models. We collect the largest dataset for GUI visual grounding so far, containing 10M GUI elements and their referring expressions over 1.3M screenshots, and use it to train UGround, a strong universal visual grounding model for GUI agents. Empirical results on six benchmarks spanning three categories (grounding, offline agent, and online agent) show that 1) UGround substantially outperforms existing visual grounding models for GUI agents, by up to 20% absolute, and 2) agents with UGround outperform state-of-the-art agents, despite the fact that existing agents use additional text-based input while ours only uses visual perception. These results provide strong support for the feasibility and promises of GUI agents that navigate the digital world as humans do.

Abstract: Scientific discovery contributes largely to human society's prosperity, and recent progress shows that LLMs could potentially catalyze this process. However, it is still unclear whether LLMs can discover novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we investigate this central research question: Can LLMs automatically discover novel and valid chemistry research hypotheses given only a chemistry research background (consisting of a research question and/or a background survey), without limitation on the domain of the research question? After extensive discussions with chemistry experts, we propose an assumption that a majority of chemistry hypotheses can be resulted from a research background and several inspirations. With this key insight, we break the central question into three smaller fundamental questions. In brief, they are: (1) given a background question, whether LLMs can retrieve good inspirations; (2) with background and inspirations, whether LLMs can lead to hypothesis; and (3) whether LLMs can identify good hypotheses to rank them higher. To investigate these questions, we construct a benchmark consisting of 51 chemistry papers published in Nature, Science, or a similar level in 2024 (all papers are only available online since 2024). Every paper is divided by chemistry PhD students into three components: background, inspirations, and hypothesis. The goal is to rediscover the hypothesis, given only the background and a large randomly selected chemistry literature corpus consisting the ground truth inspiration papers, with LLMs trained with data up to 2023. We also develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework that leverages the assumption, consisting of three stages reflecting the three smaller questions. The proposed method can rediscover many hypotheses with very high similarity with the ground truth ones, covering the main innovations.

本文关注于如何在大型语言模型（LLMs）超越人类能力的任务场景中，实现对其的紧急价值对齐问题。由于现有的对齐方法主要集中在强到弱以及自我对齐的设置上，对于更困难的弱到强对齐场景并不适用。为填补这一空白，文章提出了一种名为多智能体对比性偏好优化（MACPO）的框架。MACPO通过迭代强化不熟悉的正向行为并惩罚熟悉的负向行为，使弱教师和强学生能够相互学习。具体来说，文章设计了互惠正向行为增强策略，促使两者从对方的正向行为中学习，并为下一轮迭代提供更高质的正向行为。此外，还提出了构建负向行为的困难策略，通过对负向行为数据进行微调，诱导弱教师和强学生生成熟悉的负向行为。实验结果在HH-RLHF和PKU-SafeRLHF数据集上的自动指标及人类判断显示，MACPO成功地同时提升了强学生和弱教师的对齐性能。随着弱教师数量的增加，MACPO通过更多的迭代优化轮次实现了更好的弱到强对齐效果。 <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing and achieving near-human capabilities on specific tasks, aligning them with human values is becoming more urgent. In scenarios where LLMs outperform humans, we face a weak-to-strong alignment problem where we need to effectively align strong student LLMs through weak supervision generated by weak teachers. Existing alignment methods mainly focus on strong-to-weak alignment and self-alignment settings, and it is impractical to adapt them to the much harder weak-to-strong alignment setting. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-agent contrastive preference optimization (MACPO) framework. MACPO facilitates weak teachers and strong students to learn from each other by iteratively reinforcing unfamiliar positive behaviors while penalizing familiar negative ones. To get this, we devise a mutual positive behavior augmentation strategy to encourage weak teachers and strong students to learn from each other's positive behavior and further provide higher quality positive behavior for the next iteration. Additionally, we propose a hard negative behavior construction strategy to induce weak teachers and strong students to generate familiar negative behavior by fine-tuning on negative behavioral data. Experimental results on the HH-RLHF and PKU-SafeRLHF datasets, evaluated using both automatic metrics and human judgments, demonstrate that MACPO simultaneously improves the alignment performance of strong students and weak teachers. Moreover, as the number of weak teachers increases, MACPO achieves better weak-to-strong alignment performance through more iteration optimization rounds.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant potential in performing diverse tasks, including the ability to call functions or use external tools to enhance their performance. While current research on function calling by LLMs primarily focuses on single-turn interactions, this paper addresses the overlooked necessity for LLMs to engage in multi-turn function calling--critical for handling compositional, real-world queries that require planning with functions but not only use functions. To facilitate this, we introduce an approach, BUTTON, which generates synthetic compositional instruction tuning data via bottom-up instruction construction and top-down trajectory generation. In the bottom-up phase, we generate simple atomic tasks based on real-world scenarios and build compositional tasks using heuristic strategies based on atomic tasks. Corresponding function definitions are then synthesized for these compositional tasks. The top-down phase features a multi-agent environment where interactions among simulated humans, assistants, and tools are utilized to gather multi-turn function calling trajectories. This approach ensures task compositionality and allows for effective function and trajectory generation by examining atomic tasks within compositional tasks. We produce a dataset BUTTONInstruct comprising 8k data points and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across various LLMs.

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based agents face significant challenges in handling complex GUI (Graphical User Interface) interactions on devices. These challenges arise from the dynamic and structured nature of GUI environments, which integrate text, images, and spatial relationships, as well as the variability in action spaces across different pages and tasks. To address these limitations, we propose MobA, a novel MLLM-based mobile assistant system. MobA introduces an adaptive planning module that incorporates a reflection mechanism for error recovery and dynamically adjusts plans to align with the real environment contexts and action module's execution capacity. Additionally, a multifaceted memory module provides comprehensive memory support to enhance adaptability and efficiency. We also present MobBench, a dataset designed for complex mobile interactions. Experimental results on MobBench and AndroidArena demonstrate MobA's ability to handle dynamic GUI environments and perform complex mobile task.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning is a key method for training multi-robot systems over a series of episodes in which robots are rewarded or punished according to their performance; only once the system is trained to a suitable standard is it deployed in the real world. If the system is not trained enough, the task will likely not be completed and could pose a risk to the surrounding environment. Therefore, reaching high performance in a shorter training period can lead to significant reductions in time and resource consumption. We introduce Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning guided by Language-based Inter-Robot Negotiation (MARLIN), which makes the training process both faster and more transparent. We equip robots with large language models that negotiate and debate the task, producing a plan that is used to guide the policy during training. We dynamically switch between using reinforcement learning and the negotiation-based approach throughout training. This offers an increase in training speed when compared to standard multi-agent reinforcement learning and allows the system to be deployed to physical hardware earlier. As robots negotiate in natural language, we can better understand the behaviour of the robots individually and as a collective. We compare the performance of our approach to multi-agent reinforcement learning and a large language model to show that our hybrid method trains faster at little cost to performance.

Abstract: Developing language model-based dialogue agents requires effective data to train models that can follow specific task logic. However, most existing data simulation methods focus on increasing diversity in language, topics, or dialogue acts at the utterance level, largely neglecting a critical aspect of task logic diversity at the dialogue level. This paper proposes a novel data simulation method designed to enhance the diversity of synthetic dialogues by focusing on task execution logic. Our method uses LLMs to generate decision tree-structured task plans, which enables the derivation of diverse dialogue trajectories for a given task. Each trajectory, referred to as a "dialog flow", guides the generation of a multi-turn dialogue that follows a unique trajectory. We apply this method to generate a task-oriented dialogue dataset comprising 3,886 dialogue flows across 15 different domains. We validate the effectiveness of this dataset using the next action prediction task, where models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform strong baselines, including GPT-4. Upon acceptance of this paper, we plan to release the code and data publicly.

Abstract: Software engineers operating in complex and dynamic environments must continuously adapt to evolving requirements, learn iteratively from experience, and reconsider their approaches based on new insights. However, current large language model (LLM)-based software agents often follow linear, sequential processes that prevent backtracking and exploration of alternative solutions, limiting their ability to rethink their strategies when initial approaches prove ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose SWE-Search, a multi-agent framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a self-improvement mechanism to enhance software agents' performance on repository-level software tasks. SWE-Search extends traditional MCTS by incorporating a hybrid value function that leverages LLMs for both numerical value estimation and qualitative evaluation. This enables self-feedback loops where agents iteratively refine their strategies based on both quantitative numerical evaluations and qualitative natural language assessments of pursued trajectories. The framework includes a SWE-Agent for adaptive exploration, a Value Agent for iterative feedback, and a Discriminator Agent that facilitates multi-agent debate for collaborative decision-making. Applied to the SWE-bench benchmark, our approach demonstrates a 23% relative improvement in performance across five models compared to standard open-source agents without MCTS. Our analysis reveals how performance scales with increased inference-time compute through deeper search, providing a pathway to improve software agents without requiring larger models or additional training data. This highlights the potential of self-evaluation driven search techniques in complex software engineering environments.

We outline an online algorithm for inventing such predicates and learning abstract world models. We compare our approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning, vision-language model planning, and symbolic predicate invention approaches, on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks across five simulated robotic domains. Results show that our approach offers better sample complexity, stronger out-of-distribution generalization, and improved interpretability.

Abstract: While large models trained with self-supervised learning on offline datasets have shown remarkable capabilities in text and image domains, achieving the same generalisation for agents that act in sequential decision problems remains an open challenge. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by procedurally generating tens of millions of 2D physics-based tasks and using these to train a general reinforcement learning (RL) agent for physical control. To this end, we introduce Kinetix: an open-ended space of physics-based RL environments that can represent tasks ranging from robotic locomotion and grasping to video games and classic RL environments, all within a unified framework. Kinetix makes use of our novel hardware-accelerated physics engine Jax2D that allows us to cheaply simulate billions of environment steps during training. Our trained agent exhibits strong physical reasoning capabilities in 2D space, being able to zero-shot solve unseen human-designed environments. Furthermore, fine-tuning this general agent on tasks of interest shows significantly stronger performance than training an RL agent *tabula rasa*. This includes solving some environments that standard RL training completely fails at. We believe this demonstrates the feasibility of large scale, mixed-quality pre-training for online RL and we hope that Kinetix will serve as a useful framework to investigate this further.

Abstract: In this work, we address the cooperation problem among large language model (LLM) based embodied agents, where agents must cooperate to achieve a common goal. Previous methods often execute actions extemporaneously and incoherently, without long-term strategic and cooperative planning, leading to redundant steps, failures, and even serious repercussions in complex tasks like search-and-rescue missions where discussion and cooperative plan are crucial. To solve this issue, we propose Cooperative Plan Optimization (CaPo) to enhance the cooperation efficiency of LLM-based embodied agents. Inspired by human cooperation schemes, CaPo improves cooperation efficiency with two phases: 1) meta-plan generation, and 2) progress-adaptive meta-plan and execution. In the first phase, all agents analyze the task, discuss, and cooperatively create a meta-plan that decomposes the task into subtasks with detailed steps, ensuring a long-term strategic and coherent plan for efficient coordination. In the second phase, agents execute tasks according to the meta-plan and dynamically adjust it based on their latest progress (e.g., discovering a target object) through multi-turn discussions. This progress-based adaptation eliminates redundant actions, improving the overall cooperation efficiency of agents. Experimental results on the ThreeDworld Multi-Agent Transport and Communicative Watch-And-Help tasks demonstrate that CaPo achieves much higher task completion rate and efficiency compared with state-of-the-arts.The code is released at https://github.com/jliu4ai/CaPo.

Abstract: To enhance large language models (LLMs) for chemistry problem solving, several LLM-based agents augmented with tools have been proposed, such as ChemCrow and Coscientist. However, their evaluations are narrow in scope, leaving a large gap in understanding the benefits of tools across diverse chemistry tasks. To bridge this gap, we develop ChemToolAgent, an enhanced chemistry agent over ChemCrow, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its performance on both specialized chemistry tasks and general chemistry questions. Surprisingly, ChemToolAgent does not consistently outperform its base LLMs without tools. Our error analysis with a chemistry expert suggests that: For specialized chemistry tasks, such as synthesis prediction, we should augment agents with specialized tools; however, for general chemistry questions like those in exams, agents' ability to reason correctly with chemistry knowledge matters more, and tool augmentation does not always help.

Abstract: Social influence plays a significant role in shaping individual sentiments and actions, particularly in a world of ubiquitous digital interconnection. The rapid development of generative AI has engendered well-founded concerns regarding the potential scalable implementation of radicalization techniques in social media. Motivated by these developments, we present a case study investigating the effects of small but intentional perturbations on a simple social network. We employ Taylor's classic model of social influence and tools from robust control theory (most notably the Dynamical Structure Function (DSF)), to identify perturbations that qualitatively alter the system's behavior while remaining as unobtrusive as possible. We examine two such scenarios: perturbations to an existing link and perturbations that introduce a new link to the network. In each case, we identify destabilizing perturbations of minimal norm and simulate their effects. Remarkably, we find that small but targeted alterations to network structure may lead to the radicalization of all agents, exhibiting the potential for large-scale shifts in collective behavior to be triggered by comparatively minuscule adjustments in social influence. Given that this method of identifying perturbations that are innocuous yet destabilizing applies to any suitable dynamical system, our findings emphasize a need for similar analyses to be carried out on real systems (e.g., real social networks), to identify the places where such dynamics may already exist.

Abstract: We introduce an Implicit Game-Theoretic MPC (IGT-MPC), a decentralized algorithm for two-agent motion planning that uses a learned value function that predicts the game-theoretic interaction outcomes as the terminal cost-to-go function in a model predictive control (MPC) framework, guiding agents to implicitly account for interactions with other agents and maximize their reward. This approach applies to competitive and cooperative multi-agent motion planning problems which we formulate as constrained dynamic games. Given a constrained dynamic game, we randomly sample initial conditions and solve for the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) to generate a dataset of GNE solutions, computing the reward outcome of each game-theoretic interaction from the GNE. The data is used to train a simple neural network to predict the reward outcome, which we use as the terminal cost-to-go function in an MPC scheme. We showcase emerging competitive and coordinated behaviors using IGT-MPC in scenarios such as two-vehicle head-to-head racing and un-signalized intersection navigation. IGT-MPC offers a novel method integrating machine learning and game-theoretic reasoning into model-based decentralized multi-agent motion planning.

Abstract: Constructing compact and informative 3D scene representations is essential for effective embodied exploration and reasoning, especially in complex environments over extended periods. Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents can automate complex tasks across digital environments, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality trajectory data for training. Existing approaches rely on expensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. We propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates web agent trajectories by leveraging publicly available tutorials. Our three-stage method: (1) automatically harvests and filters tutorial-like texts from the internet using a specialized classification model, (2) transforms these texts into structured task specifications with step-by-step instructions, and (3) employs a visual-language model (VLM) agent to execute these instructions in real environments, while a VLM-based evaluator verifies trajectory correctness. The synthesized trajectories encompass multiple modalities, including text-based HTML observations with function-calling API actions, and vision-based screenshot observations with pixel-level actions. This multimodal data, enriched with chain-of-thought reasoning, enables agents to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both textual web browsing benchmarks (e.g., WebArena) and visual web grounding and browsing benchmarks (e.g., ScreenSpot Web and Multimodal Mind2Web). Furthermore, our fully automated approach significantly reduces data collection costs, achieving a cost of just $0.55 per high-quality trajectory without human annotators. Our work demonstrates that guided replay using web tutorials is a practical and scalable strategy for training advanced GUI agents, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital assistants.

本文提出了利用多智能体社会的语言模型进行自我改进的方法。针对单一模型自我改进可能遭遇瓶颈的问题，该工作建议将多个相同基础模型独立专业化，通过各模型间的多智能体交互生成的数据进行微调更新。这样使得每个模型能够在独立数据集上进行专业化训练，实现模型间的差异性和多样性。实验表明，此方法相较于单智能体自我改进策略，能够保持更多样化的推理链条并实现更多轮次的自主性能提升。该方法的优势在一系列推理任务中得到了定量验证。 <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in recent years but are fundamentally limited by the underlying training data. To improve models beyond the training data, recent works have explored how LLMs can be used to generate synthetic data for autonomous self-improvement. However, successive steps of self-improvement can reach a point of diminishing returns. In this work, we propose a complementary approach towards self-improvement where finetuning is applied to a multiagent society of language models. A group of language models, all starting from the same base model, are independently specialized by updating each one using data generated through multiagent interactions among the models. By training each model on independent sets of data, we illustrate how this approach enables specialization across models and diversification over the set of models. As a result, our overall system is able to preserve diverse reasoning chains and autonomously improve over many more rounds of fine-tuning than single-agent self-improvement methods. We quantitatively illustrate the efficacy of the approach across a wide suite of reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The Moving-Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MT-TSP) seeks a shortest path for an agent that starts at a stationary depot, visits a set of moving targets exactly once, each within one of their respective time windows, and returns to the depot. In this paper, we introduce a new Mixed-Integer Conic Program (MICP) formulation for the Multi-Agent Moving-Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MA-MT-TSP), a generalization of the MT-TSP involving multiple agents. Our approach begins by restating the current state-of-the-art MICP formulation for MA-MT-TSP as a Nonconvex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP), followed by a novel reformulation into a new MICP. We present computational results demonstrating that our formulation outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving up to two orders of magnitude reduction in runtime, and over 90% improvement in optimality gap.

Abstract: Credit assignment, the process of attributing credit or blame to individual agents for their contributions to a team's success or failure, remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly in environments with sparse rewards. Commonly-used approaches such as value decomposition often lead to suboptimal policies in these settings, and designing dense reward functions that align with human intuition can be complex and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a novel framework where a large language model (LLM) generates dense, agent-specific rewards based on a natural language description of the task and the overall team goal. By learning a potential-based reward function over multiple queries, our method reduces the impact of ranking errors while allowing the LLM to evaluate each agent's contribution to the overall task. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence and higher policy returns compared to state-of-the-art MARL baselines.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in decentralized multi-agent systems presents significant challenges due to emergent biases, systemic inefficiencies, and conflicting agent incentives. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of fairness in multi-agent AI, introducing a novel framework where fairness is treated as a dynamic, emergent property of agent interactions. The framework integrates fairness constraints, bias mitigation strategies, and incentive mechanisms to align autonomous agent behaviors with societal values while balancing efficiency and robustness. Through empirical validation, we demonstrate that incorporating fairness constraints results in more equitable decision-making. This work bridges the gap between AI ethics and system design, offering a foundation for accountable, transparent, and socially responsible multi-agent AI systems.

Abstract: A key objective of embodied intelligence is enabling agents to perform long-horizon tasks in dynamic environments while maintaining robust decision-making and adaptability. To achieve this goal, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Memory Agent (STMA), a novel framework designed to enhance task planning and execution by integrating spatio-temporal memory. STMA is built upon three critical components: (1) a spatio-temporal memory module that captures historical and environmental changes in real time, (2) a dynamic knowledge graph that facilitates adaptive spatial reasoning, and (3) a planner-critic mechanism that iteratively refines task strategies. We evaluate STMA in the TextWorld environment on 32 tasks, involving multi-step planning and exploration under varying levels of complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that STMA achieves a 31.25% improvement in success rate and a 24.7% increase in average score compared to the state-of-the-art model. The results highlight the effectiveness of spatio-temporal memory in advancing the memory capabilities of embodied agents.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an essential skill for embodied agents, allowing them to navigate in 3D environments following natural language instructions. High-performance navigation models require a large amount of training data, the high cost of manually annotating data has seriously hindered this field. Therefore, some previous methods translate trajectory videos into step-by-step instructions for expanding data, but such instructions do not match well with users' communication styles that briefly describe destinations or state specific needs. Moreover, local navigation trajectories overlook global context and high-level task planning. To address these issues, we propose NavRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that generates user demand instructions for VLN. NavRAG leverages LLM to build a hierarchical scene description tree for 3D scene understanding from global layout to local details, then simulates various user roles with specific demands to retrieve from the scene tree, generating diverse instructions with LLM. We annotate over 2 million navigation instructions across 861 scenes and evaluate the data quality and navigation performance of trained models.

<title>Grassroots Platforms with Atomic Transactions: Social Networks, Cryptocurrencies, and Democratic Federations</title>

Abstract: Grassroots platforms aim to offer an egalitarian alternative to global platforms -- centralized/autocratic (Facebook etc.) and decentralized/plutocratic (Bitcoin etc.) alike. Key grassroots platforms include grassroots social networks, grassroots cryptocurrencies, and grassroots democratic federations. Previously, grassroots platforms were defined formally and proven grassroots using unary distributed transition systems, in which each transition is carried out by a single agent. However, grassroots platforms cater for a more abstract specification using transactions carried out atomically by multiple agents, something that cannot be expressed by unary transition systems. As a result, their original specifications and proofs were unnecessarily cumbersome and opaque.
  Here, we aim to provide a more suitable formal foundation for grassroots platforms. To do so, we enhance the notion of a distributed transition system to include atomic transactions and revisit the notion of grassroots platforms within this new foundation. We present crisp specifications of key grassroots platforms using atomic transactions: befriending and defriending for grassroots social networks, coin swaps for grassroots cryptocurrencies, and communities forming, joining, and leaving a federation for grassroots democratic federations. We prove a general theorem that a platform specified by atomic transactions that are so-called interactive is grassroots; show that the atomic transactions used to specify all three platforms are interactive; and conclude that the platforms thus specified are indeed grassroots. We thus provide a better mathematical foundation for grassroots platforms and a solid and clear starting point from which their implementation can commence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving into autonomous decision-makers, raising concerns about catastrophic risks in high-stakes scenarios, particularly in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) domains. Based on the insight that such risks can originate from trade-offs between the agent's Helpful, Harmlessness and Honest (HHH) goals, we build a novel three-stage evaluation framework, which is carefully constructed to effectively and naturally expose such risks. We conduct 14,400 agentic simulations across 12 advanced LLMs, with extensive experiments and analysis. Results reveal that LLM agents can autonomously engage in catastrophic behaviors and deception, without being deliberately induced. Furthermore, stronger reasoning abilities often increase, rather than mitigate, these risks. We also show that these agents can violate instructions and superior commands. On the whole, we empirically prove the existence of catastrophic risks in autonomous LLM agents. We will release our code upon request.

Abstract: While large language model (LLM) agents can effectively use external tools for complex real-world tasks, they require memory systems to leverage historical experiences. Current memory systems enable basic storage and retrieval but lack sophisticated memory organization, despite recent attempts to incorporate graph databases. Moreover, these systems' fixed operations and structures limit their adaptability across diverse tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel agentic memory system for LLM agents that can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way. Following the basic principles of the Zettelkasten method, we designed our memory system to create interconnected knowledge networks through dynamic indexing and linking. When a new memory is added, we generate a comprehensive note containing multiple structured attributes, including contextual descriptions, keywords, and tags. The system then analyzes historical memories to identify relevant connections, establishing links where meaningful similarities exist. Additionally, this process enables memory evolution - as new memories are integrated, they can trigger updates to the contextual representations and attributes of existing historical memories, allowing the memory network to continuously refine its understanding. Our approach combines the structured organization principles of Zettelkasten with the flexibility of agent-driven decision making, allowing for more adaptive and context-aware memory management. Empirical experiments on six foundation models show superior improvement against existing SOTA baselines. The source code is available at https://github.com/WujiangXu/AgenticMemory.

Abstract: The paper focuses on mean-field type multi-agent control problems with finite state and action spaces where the dynamics and cost structures are symmetric and homogeneous, and are affected by the distribution of the agents. A standard solution method for these problems is to consider the infinite population limit as an approximation and use symmetric solutions of the limit problem to achieve near optimality. The control policies, and in particular the dynamics, depend on the population distribution in the finite population setting, or the marginal distribution of the state variable of a representative agent for the infinite population setting. Hence, learning and planning for these control problems generally require estimating the reaction of the system to all possible state distributions of the agents. To overcome this issue, we consider linear function approximation for the control problem and provide coordinated and independent learning methods. We rigorously establish error upper bounds for the performance of learned solutions. The performance gap stems from (i) the mismatch due to estimating the true model with a linear one, and (ii) using the infinite population solution in the finite population problem as an approximate control. The provided upper bounds quantify the impact of these error sources on the overall performance.

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) and autonomous AI agents has raised concerns about their potential for automated persuasion and social influence. While existing research has explored isolated instances of LLM-based manipulation, systematic evaluations of persuasion capabilities across different models remain limited. In this paper, we present an Among Us-inspired game framework for assessing LLM deception skills in a controlled environment. The proposed framework makes it possible to compare LLM models by game statistics, as well as quantify in-game manipulation according to 25 persuasion strategies from social psychology and rhetoric. Experiments between 8 popular language models of different types and sizes demonstrate that all tested models exhibit persuasive capabilities, successfully employing 22 of the 25 anticipated techniques. We also find that larger models do not provide any persuasion advantage over smaller models and that longer model outputs are negatively correlated with the number of games won. Our study provides insights into the deception capabilities of LLMs, as well as tools and data for fostering future research on the topic.

本文探讨了战略决策中的互动推理问题，指出现有对大型语言模型（LLMs）的评估往往过于关注Nash均衡近似，而忽视了驱动其战略选择的机制。为弥补这一差距，文章引入了一个基于行为博弈论的评价框架，将推理能力与情境效应分开考虑。研究发现，GPT-o3-mini、GPT-o1和DeepSeek-R1在游戏中表现出色，但模型规模本身并不能决定性能。关于提示增强技术，链式思维（Chain-of-Thought, CoT）提示并非普遍有效，仅对特定级别的模型提高了战略推理能力。此外，文章还研究了编码的demographic特征对模型决策过程的影响，观察到某些身份设定会影响决策模式，例如GPT-4o在赋予女性特质时展现出更强的战略推理能力，而Gemma在赋予异性恋身份时相比其他性取向显示出更高的推理水平，这揭示了模型中存在内在的偏见。这些发现强调了需要平衡提高推理能力和公平性之间的关系，并提出了对伦理标准和上下文对齐的需求。 <div>

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves interactive reasoning where agents adapt their choices in response to others, yet existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often emphasize Nash Equilibrium (NE) approximation, overlooking the mechanisms driving their strategic choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce an evaluation framework grounded in behavioral game theory, disentangling reasoning capability from contextual effects. Testing 22 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that GPT-o3-mini, GPT-o1, and DeepSeek-R1 dominate most games yet also demonstrate that the model scale alone does not determine performance. In terms of prompting enhancement, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is not universally effective, as it increases strategic reasoning only for models at certain levels while providing limited gains elsewhere. Additionally, we investigate the impact of encoded demographic features on the models, observing that certain assignments impact the decision-making pattern. For instance, GPT-4o shows stronger strategic reasoning with female traits than males, while Gemma assigns higher reasoning levels to heterosexual identities compared to other sexual orientations, indicating inherent biases. These findings underscore the need for ethical standards and contextual alignment to balance improved reasoning with fairness.

Abstract: Constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning offers the framework to design scalable and almost surely feasible solutions for teams of agents operating in dynamic environments to carry out conflicting tasks. We address the challenges of multi-agent coordination through an unconventional formulation in which the dual variables are not driven to convergence but are free to cycle, enabling agents to adapt their policies dynamically based on real-time constraint satisfaction levels. The coordination relies on a light single-bit communication protocol over a network with stochastic connectivity. Using this gossiped information, agents update local estimates of the dual variables. Furthermore, we modify the local dual dynamics by introducing a contraction factor, which lets us use finite communication buffers and keep the estimation error bounded. Under this model, we provide theoretical guarantees of almost sure feasibility and corroborate them with numerical experiments in which a team of robots successfully patrols multiple regions, communicating under a time-varying ad-hoc network.

Abstract: Human activity is moderated by norms. When performing actions in the real world, humans not only follow norms, but also consider the trade-off between different norms However, machines are often trained without explicit supervision on norm understanding and reasoning, especially when the norms are grounded in a physical and social context. To improve and evaluate the normative reasoning capability of vision-language models (VLMs), we present EgoNormia $\|\epsilon\|$, consisting of 1,853 ego-centric videos of human interactions, each of which has two related questions evaluating both the prediction and justification of normative actions. The normative actions encompass seven categories: safety, privacy, proxemics, politeness, cooperation, coordination/proactivity, and communication/legibility. To compile this dataset at scale, we propose a novel pipeline leveraging video sampling, automatic answer generation, filtering, and human validation. Our work demonstrates that current state-of-the-art vision-language models lack robust norm understanding, scoring a maximum of 45% on EgoNormia (versus a human bench of 92%). Our analysis of performance in each dimension highlights the significant risks of safety, privacy, and the lack of collaboration and communication capability when applied to real-world agents. We additionally show that through a retrieval-based generation method, it is possible to use EgoNomia to enhance normative reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable advancements in embodying diverse personas, enhancing their effectiveness as conversational agents and virtual assistants. Consequently, LLMs have made significant strides in processing and integrating multimodal information. However, even though human personas can be expressed in both text and image, the extent to which the modality of a persona impacts the embodiment by the LLM remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate how do different modalities influence the expressiveness of personas in multimodal LLMs. To this end, we create a novel modality-parallel dataset of 40 diverse personas varying in age, gender, occupation, and location. This consists of four modalities to equivalently represent a persona: image-only, text-only, a combination of image and small text, and typographical images, where text is visually stylized to convey persona-related attributes. We then create a systematic evaluation framework with 60 questions and corresponding metrics to assess how well LLMs embody each persona across its attributes and scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on $5$ multimodal LLMs show that personas represented by detailed text show more linguistic habits, while typographical images often show more consistency with the persona. Our results reveal that LLMs often overlook persona-specific details conveyed through images, highlighting underlying limitations and paving the way for future research to bridge this gap. We release the data and code at https://github.com/claws-lab/persona-modality .

Abstract: Recent advancements in probing Large Language Models (LLMs) have explored their latent potential as personalized travel planning agents, yet existing benchmarks remain limited in real world applicability. Existing datasets, such as TravelPlanner and TravelPlanner+, suffer from semi synthetic data reliance, spatial inconsistencies, and a lack of key travel constraints, making them inadequate for practical itinerary generation. To address these gaps, we introduce TripCraft, a spatiotemporally coherent travel planning dataset that integrates real world constraints, including public transit schedules, event availability, diverse attraction categories, and user personas for enhanced personalization. To evaluate LLM generated plans beyond existing binary validation methods, we propose five continuous evaluation metrics, namely Temporal Meal Score, Temporal Attraction Score, Spatial Score, Ordering Score, and Persona Score which assess itinerary quality across multiple dimensions. Our parameter informed setting significantly enhances meal scheduling, improving the Temporal Meal Score from 61% to 80% in a 7 day scenario. TripCraft establishes a new benchmark for LLM driven personalized travel planning, offering a more realistic, constraint aware framework for itinerary generation. Dataset and Codebase will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored in higher education, yet their effectiveness as teaching agents remains underexamined. In this paper, we present the development of GuideLM, a fine-tuned LLM designed for programming education. GuideLM has been integrated into the Debugging C Compiler (DCC), an educational C compiler that leverages LLMs to generate pedagogically sound error explanations. Previously, DCC relied on off-the-shelf OpenAI models, which, while accurate, often over-assisted students by directly providing solutions despite contrary prompting.
  To address this, we employed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a dataset of 528 student-question/teacher-answer pairs, creating two models: GuideLM and GuideLM-mini, fine-tuned on ChatGPT-4o and 4o-mini, respectively. We conducted an expert analysis of 400 responses per model, comparing their pedagogical effectiveness against base OpenAI models. Our evaluation, grounded in constructivism and cognitive load theory, assessed factors such as conceptual scaffolding, clarity, and Socratic guidance.
  Results indicate that GuideLM and GuideLM-mini improve pedagogical performance, with an 8% increase in Socratic guidance and a 58% improvement in economy of words compared to GPT-4o. However, this refinement comes at the cost of a slight reduction in general accuracy. While further work is needed, our findings suggest that fine-tuning LLMs with targeted datasets is a promising approach for developing models better suited to educational contexts.

Abstract: With the increasingly congested and contested space environment, safe and effective satellite operation has become increasingly challenging. As a result, there is growing interest in autonomous satellite capabilities, with common machine learning techniques gaining attention for their potential to address complex decision-making in the space domain. However, the "black-box" nature of many of these methods results in difficulty understanding the model's input/output relationship and more specifically its sensitivity to environmental disturbances, sensor noise, and control intervention. This paper explores the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for satellite control in multi-agent inspection tasks. The Local Intelligent Network of Collaborative Satellites (LINCS) Lab is used to test the performance of these control algorithms across different environments, from simulations to real-world quadrotor UAV hardware, with a particular focus on understanding their behavior and potential degradation in performance when deployed beyond the training environment.

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种名为REDs的新颖奖励学习框架，旨在解决强化学习代理依赖于人工设计奖励函数的问题。REDs利用来自不同源、带有子任务分割的无动作视频进行最少监督的奖励学习。通过将视频片段及其对应的子任务作为真实奖励信号的地面真相，训练一个密集型奖励函数并最小化等价策略不变性比较距离以确保对齐。同时，采用对比学习目标来使视频表示与子任务对齐，保证在线交互过程中精确的子任务推断。实验表明，REDs在Meta-World的复杂机器人操纵任务以及FurnitureBench的真实世界家具组装等更具挑战性的任务上，显著优于基线方法，且能以极小的人类干预实现对未见过的任务和机器人载体的泛化能力，显示出其在多样化环境中可扩展部署的潜力。 <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have demonstrated their potential across various robotic tasks. However, they still heavily rely on human-engineered reward functions, requiring extensive trial-and-error and access to target behavior information, often unavailable in real-world settings. This paper introduces REDS: REward learning from Demonstration with Segmentations, a novel reward learning framework that leverages action-free videos with minimal supervision. Specifically, REDS employs video demonstrations segmented into subtasks from diverse sources and treats these segments as ground-truth rewards. We train a dense reward function conditioned on video segments and their corresponding subtasks to ensure alignment with ground-truth reward signals by minimizing the Equivalent-Policy Invariant Comparison distance. Additionally, we employ contrastive learning objectives to align video representations with subtasks, ensuring precise subtask inference during online interactions. Our experiments show that REDS significantly outperforms baseline methods on complex robotic manipulation tasks in Meta-World and more challenging real-world tasks, such as furniture assembly in FurnitureBench, with minimal human intervention. Moreover, REDS facilitates generalization to unseen tasks and robot embodiments, highlighting its potential for scalable deployment in diverse environments.

Abstract: Reliable automated driving technology is challenged by various sources of uncertainties, in particular, behavioral uncertainties of traffic agents. It is common for traffic agents to have intentions that are unknown to others, leaving an automated driving car to reason over multiple possible behaviors. This paper formalizes a behavior planning scheme in the presence of multiple possible futures with corresponding probabilities. We present a maximum entropy formulation and show how, under certain assumptions, this allows delayed decision-making to improve safety. The general formulation is then turned into a model predictive control formulation, which is solved as a quadratic program or a set of quadratic programs. We discuss implementation details for improving computation and verify operation in simulation and on a mobile robot.

Abstract: Most LLM-driven conversational AI systems operate reactively, responding to user prompts without guiding the interaction. Most LLM-driven conversational AI systems operate reactively, responding to user prompts without guiding the interaction. However, many real-world applications-such as psychiatric diagnosis, consulting, and interviews-require AI to take a proactive role, asking the right questions and steering conversations toward specific objectives. Using mental health differential diagnosis as an application context, we introduce ProAI, a goal-oriented, proactive conversational AI framework. ProAI integrates structured knowledge-guided memory, multi-agent proactive reasoning, and a multi-faceted evaluation strategy, enabling LLMs to engage in clinician-style diagnostic reasoning rather than simple response generation. Through simulated patient interactions, user experience assessment, and professional clinical validation, we demonstrate that ProAI achieves up to 83.3% accuracy in mental disorder differential diagnosis while maintaining professional and empathetic interaction standards. These results highlight the potential for more reliable, adaptive, and goal-driven AI diagnostic assistants, advancing LLMs beyond reactive dialogue systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable advances in role-playing dialogue agents, demonstrating their utility in character simulations. However, it remains challenging for these agents to balance character portrayal utility with content safety because this essential character simulation often comes with the risk of generating unsafe content. To address this issue, we first conduct a systematic exploration of the safety-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Our analysis reveals that risk scenarios created by villain characters and user queries (referred to as risk coupling) contribute to this trade-off. Building on this, we propose a novel Adaptive Dynamic Multi-Preference (ADMP) method, which dynamically adjusts safety-utility preferences based on the degree of risk coupling and guides the model to generate responses biased toward utility or safety. We further introduce Coupling Margin Sampling (CMS) into coupling detection to enhance the model's ability to handle high-risk scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves safety metrics while maintaining utility.

Abstract: The exponential growth of cyber threat knowledge, exemplified by the expansion of databases such as MITRE-CVE and NVD, poses significant challenges for cyber threat analysis. Security professionals are increasingly burdened by the sheer volume and complexity of information, creating an urgent need for effective tools to navigate, synthesize, and act on large-scale data to counter evolving threats proactively. However, conventional threat intelligence tools often fail to scale with the dynamic nature of this data and lack the adaptability to support diverse threat intelligence tasks.
  In this work, we introduce CYLENS, a cyber threat intelligence copilot powered by large language models (LLMs). CYLENS is designed to assist security professionals throughout the entire threat management lifecycle, supporting threat attribution, contextualization, detection, correlation, prioritization, and remediation. To ensure domain expertise, CYLENS integrates knowledge from 271,570 threat reports into its model parameters and incorporates six specialized NLP modules to enhance reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, CYLENS can be customized to meet the unique needs of different or ganizations, underscoring its adaptability. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that CYLENS consistently outperforms industry-leading LLMs and state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents. By detailing its design, development, and evaluation, this work provides a blueprint for leveraging LLMs to address complex, data-intensive cybersecurity challenges.

Abstract: For robots to operate in general environments like households, they must be able to perform non-prehensile manipulation actions such as toppling and rolling to manipulate ungraspable objects. However, prior works on non-prehensile manipulation cannot yet generalize across environments with diverse geometries. The main challenge lies in adapting to varying environmental constraints: within a cabinet, the robot must avoid walls and ceilings; to lift objects to the top of a step, the robot must account for the step's pose and extent. While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated impressive success in non-prehensile manipulation, accounting for such variability presents a challenge for the generalist policy, as it must learn diverse strategies for each new combination of constraints. To address this, we propose a modular and reconfigurable architecture that adaptively reconfigures network modules based on task requirements. To capture the geometric variability in environments, we extend the contact-based object representation (CORN) to environment geometries, and propose a procedural algorithm for generating diverse environments to train our agent. Taken together, the resulting policy can zero-shot transfer to novel real-world environments and objects despite training entirely within a simulator. We additionally release a simulation-based benchmark featuring nine digital twins of real-world scenes with 353 objects to facilitate non-prehensile manipulation research in realistic domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in both closed tasks (including problem-solving, and code generation) and open tasks (including creative writing), yet existing explanations for their capabilities lack connections to real-world human intelligence. To fill this gap, this paper systematically investigates LLM intelligence through the lens of ``human simulation'', addressing three core questions: (1) How do personality traits affect problem-solving in closed tasks? (2) How do traits shape creativity in open tasks? (3) How does single-agent performance influence multi-agent collaboration? By assigning Big Five personality traits to LLM agents and evaluating their performance in single- and multi-agent settings, we reveal that specific traits significantly influence reasoning accuracy (closed tasks) and creative output (open tasks). Furthermore, multi-agent systems exhibit collective intelligence distinct from individual capabilities, driven by distinguishing combinations of personalities. We demonstrate that LLMs inherently simulate human behavior through next-token prediction, mirroring human language, decision-making, and collaborative dynamics.

Abstract: Analyzing textual data is the cornerstone of qualitative research. While traditional methods such as grounded theory and content analysis are widely used, they are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Topic modeling offers an automated complement. Yet, existing approaches, including LLM-based topic modeling, still struggle with issues such as high data preprocessing requirements, interpretability, and reliability. This paper introduces Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) as a method for topic modeling with LLMs. It integrates three key components: (1) retrieval, enabling automatized access to external data beyond an LLM's pre-trained knowledge; (2) generation, leveraging LLM capabilities for text synthesis; and (3) agent-driven learning, iteratively refining retrieval and query formulation processes. To empirically validate Agentic RAG for topic modeling, we reanalyze a Twitter/X dataset, previously examined by Mu et al. (2024a). Our findings demonstrate that the approach is more efficient, interpretable and at the same time achieves higher reliability and validity in comparison to the standard machine learning approach but also in comparison to LLM prompting for topic modeling. These results highlight Agentic RAG's ability to generate semantically relevant and reproducible topics, positioning it as a robust, scalable, and transparent alternative for AI-driven qualitative research in leadership, managerial, and organizational research.

本文探讨了社交虚拟现实中，随着其日益普及，优化交互体验的重要性。研究发现，在社交VR中，人际距离是一个关键因素，而以往心理学研究表明个人空间被侵犯会导致压力和不适。文章特别关注了常用移动方式——传送对于接近感的影响，通过让70名参与者与化身对话代理进行互动，对比了传送与自然行走两种方式下的人际距离。结果表明，使用传送时，参与者与代理之间的距离更近；女性参与者相比男性保持了更大的距离；同时，自然行走能带来更高的主体感和身体所有权感受，但并未影响共同存在感。作者认为，传送造成的空间感知差异和空间认知负荷可能是导致人际距离缩短的原因。这些发现强调，在选择社交VR中的移动方式时，应充分考虑接近感问题，并指出需要进一步研究移动方式如何影响虚拟环境中的空间感知和社会动态。 <div>

Abstract: As social VR grows in popularity, understanding how to optimise interactions becomes increasingly important. Interpersonal distance (the physical space people maintain between each other) is a key aspect of user experience. Previous work in psychology has shown that breaches of personal space cause stress and discomfort. Thus, effectively managing this distance is crucial in social VR, where social interactions are frequent. Teleportation, a commonly used locomotion method in these environments, involves distinct cognitive processes and requires users to rely on their ability to estimate distance. Despite its widespread use, the effect of teleportation on proximity remains unexplored. To investigate this, we measured the interpersonal distance of 70 participants during interactions with embodied conversational agents, comparing teleportation to natural walking. Our findings revealed that participants maintained closer proximity from the agents during teleportation. Female participants kept greater distances from the agents than male participants, and natural walking was associated with higher agency and body ownership, though co-presence remained unchanged. We propose that differences in spatial perception and spatial cognitive load contribute to reduced interpersonal distance with teleportation. These findings emphasise that proximity should be a key consideration when selecting locomotion methods in social VR, highlighting the need for further research on how locomotion impacts spatial perception and social dynamics in virtual environments.

Abstract: Future wireless networks will need to support diverse applications (such as extended reality), scenarios (such as fully automated industries), and technological advances (such as terahertz communications). Current wireless networks are designed to perform adequately across multiple scenarios so they lack the adaptability needed for specific use cases. Therefore, meeting the stringent requirements of next-generation applications incorporating technology advances and operating in novel scenarios will necessitate wireless specialized networks which we refer to as SpecNets. These networks, equipped with cognitive capabilities, dynamically adapt to the unique demands of each application, e.g., by automatically selecting and configuring network mechanisms. An enabler of SpecNets are the recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), which allow to continuously learn and react to changing requirements and scenarios. By integrating AI/ML functionalities, SpecNets will fully leverage the concept of AI/ML-defined radios (MLDRs) that are able to autonomously establish their own communication protocols by acquiring contextual information and dynamically adapting to it. In this paper, we introduce SpecNets and explain how MLDR interfaces enable this concept. We present three illustrative use cases for wireless local area networks (WLANs): bespoke industrial networks, traffic-aware robust THz links, and coexisting networks. Finally, we showcase SpecNets' benefits in the industrial use case by introducing a lightweight, fast-converging ML agent based on multi-armed bandits (MABs). This agent dynamically optimizes channel access to meet varying performance needs: high throughput, low delay, or fair access.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the proliferation of artificial agents in social contexts, ranging from education to online social media and financial markets, among many others. The increasing rate at which artificial and human agents interact makes it urgent to understand the consequences of human-machine interactions for the propagation of new ideas, products, and behaviors in society. Across two distinct empirical contexts, we find here that artificial agents lead to significantly faster and wider social contagion. To this end, we replicate a choice experiment previously conducted with human subjects by using artificial agents powered by large language models (LLMs). We use the experiment's results to measure the adoption thresholds of artificial agents and their impact on the spread of social contagion. We find that artificial agents tend to exhibit lower adoption thresholds than humans, which leads to wider network-based social contagions. Our findings suggest that the increased presence of artificial agents in real-world networks may accelerate behavioral shifts, potentially in unforeseen ways.

Abstract: Learning rewards from preference feedback has become an important tool in the alignment of agentic models. Preference-based feedback, often implemented as a binary comparison between multiple completions, is an established method to acquire large-scale human feedback. However, human feedback in other contexts is often much more diverse. Such diverse feedback can better support the goals of a human annotator, and the simultaneous use of multiple sources might be mutually informative for the learning process or carry type-dependent biases for the reward learning process. Despite these potential benefits, learning from different feedback types has yet to be explored extensively. In this paper, we bridge this gap by enabling experimentation and evaluating multi-type feedback in a broad set of environments. We present a process to generate high-quality simulated feedback of six different types. Then, we implement reward models and downstream RL training for all six feedback types. Based on the simulated feedback, we investigate the use of types of feedback across ten RL environments and compare them to pure preference-based baselines. We show empirically that diverse types of feedback can be utilized and lead to strong reward modeling performance. This work is the first strong indicator of the potential of multi-type feedback for RLHF.

<div> 关键词：metric distortion、投票规则、社交成本、线性度量、同行选择

总结:
这篇论文首次研究了当选民和候选人位于同一个度量空间（即同行选择）时的度量扭曲问题。文章针对不同类型的社交成本函数（包括总体效用与平均效用）以及线性度量空间进行了深入探讨。对于总体效用（加法聚合），论文指出选取中间排名的$k$个候选人可以实现随着$k$从1变化到$n$时，其扭曲率在1和2之间变化的结果。而对于个体距离其$q$个最近候选人的成本函数（$q$-cost），当$q=k=2$时有积极结果，但普遍而言，当$q \leq k/2$时不可能存在常数扭曲率，而$q \geq k/2 + 1$时最佳扭曲率不超过$3/2$。对于平均效用社交成本，选择极端排名的候选人可达到对于加法成本和$q$-cost（$q > k/3$）的最佳可能扭曲率为2；然而，当$q \leq k/3$时，不存在常数扭曲率。总的来说，相较于通用设置，该共同选民与候选人间的设定允许得到更好的常数值，但在某些情况下，通用设置中不可能存在的常数扭曲率问题在此设定下仍然困难。 <div>

Abstract: In the metric distortion problem, a set of voters and candidates lie in a common metric space, and a committee of $k$ candidates is to be elected. The goal is to select a committee with a small social cost, defined as an increasing function of the distances between voters and selected candidates, but a voting rule only has access to voters' ordinal preferences. The distortion of a rule is then defined as the worst-case ratio between the social cost of the selected set and the optimal set, over all possible preferences and consistent distances.
  We initiate the study of metric distortion when voters and candidates coincide, which arises naturally in peer selection, and provide tight results for various social cost functions on the line metric. We consider both utilitarian and egalitarian social cost, given by the sum and maximum of the individual social costs, respectively. For utilitarian social cost, we show that the voting rule that selects the $k$ middle agents achieves a distortion that varies between $1$ and $2$ as $k$ varies from $1$ to $n$ when the cost of an individual is the sum of their distances to all selected candidates (additive aggregation). When the cost of an individual is their distance to their $q$th closest candidate ($q$-cost), we provide positive results for $q=k=2$ but mostly show that negative results for general elections carry over to our setting: No constant distortion is possible when $q\leq k/2$ and no distortion better than $3/2$ is possible for $q\geq k/2+1$. For egalitarian social cost, selecting extreme agents achieves the best-possible distortion of $2$ for additive cost and $q$-cost with $q> k/3$, whereas no constant distortion is possible for $q\leq k/3$. Overall, having a common set of voters and candidates allows for better constants compared to the general setting, but cases in which no constant is possible in general remain hard in this setting.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in answering questions across various domains, but they often encounter hallucination issues on questions that require professional and up-to-date knowledge. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques have been proposed, which retrieve relevant information from external sources to inform their responses. However, existing RAG methods typically focus on a single type of external data, such as vectorized text database or knowledge graphs, and cannot well handle real-world questions on semi-structured data containing both text and relational information. To bridge this gap, we introduce PASemiQA, a novel approach that jointly leverages text and relational information in semi-structured data to answer questions. PASemiQA first generates a plan to identify relevant text and relational information to answer the question in semi-structured data, and then uses an LLM agent to traverse the semi-structured data and extract necessary information. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of PASemiQA across different semi-structured datasets from various domains, showcasing its potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of question answering systems on semi-structured data.

Abstract: A modern smart factory runs a manufacturing procedure using a collection of programmable machines. Typically, materials are ferried between these machines using a team of mobile robots. To embed a manufacturing procedure in a smart factory, a factory operator must a) assign its processes to the smart factory's machines and b) determine how agents should carry materials between machines. A good embedding maximizes the smart factory's throughput; the rate at which it outputs products. Existing smart factory management systems solve the aforementioned problems sequentially, limiting the throughput that they can achieve. In this paper we introduce ACES, the Anytime Cyclic Embedding Solver, the first solver which jointly optimizes the assignment of processes to machines and the assignment of paths to agents. We evaluate ACES and show that it can scale to real industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Humans leverage rich internal models of the world to reason about the future, imagine counterfactuals, and adapt flexibly to new situations. In Reinforcement Learning (RL), world models aim to capture how the environment evolves in response to the agent's actions, facilitating planning and generalization. However, typical world models directly operate on the environment variables (e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make their training slow and cumbersome; instead, it may be advantageous to rely on high-level latent dimensions that capture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace (GW) Theory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information broadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient deep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an RL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with various versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We show that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the GW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps. As an additional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its comparison baselines) displays strong robustness to the absence of one of its observation modalities (images or simulation attributes). We conclude that the combination of GW with World Models holds great potential for improving decision-making in RL agents.

Abstract: Curriculum learning is a training method in which an agent is first trained on a curriculum of relatively simple tasks related to a target task in an effort to shorten the time required to train on the target task. Autonomous curriculum design involves the design of such curriculum with no reliance on human knowledge and/or expertise. Finding an efficient and effective way of autonomously designing curricula remains an open problem. We propose a novel approach for automatically designing curricula by leveraging the learner's uncertainty to select curricula tasks. Our approach measures the uncertainty in the learner's policy using relative entropy, and guides the agent to states of high uncertainty to facilitate learning. Our algorithm supports the generation of autonomous curricula in a self-assessed manner by leveraging the learner's past and current policies but it also allows the use of teacher guided design in an instructive setting. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our algorithm using two time-scale optimization processes. Results show that our algorithm outperforms randomly generated curriculum, and learning directly on the target task as well as the curriculum-learning criteria existing in literature. We also present two additional heuristic distance measures that could be combined with our relative-entropy approach for further performance improvements.

Abstract: In human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning or environments where calculating a reward is expensive, the costly rewards can make learning efficiency challenging to achieve. The cost of obtaining feedback from humans or calculating expensive rewards means algorithms receiving feedback at every step of long training sessions may be infeasible, which may limit agents' abilities to efficiently improve performance. Our aim is to reduce the reliance of learning agents on humans or expensive rewards, improving the efficiency of learning while maintaining the quality of the learned policy. We offer a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that requests a reward only when its knowledge of the value of actions in an environment state is low. Our approach uses a reward function model as a proxy for human-delivered or expensive rewards when confidence is high, and asks for those explicit rewards only when there is low confidence in the model's predicted rewards and/or action selection. By reducing dependence on the expensive-to-obtain rewards, we are able to learn efficiently in settings where the logistics or expense of obtaining rewards may otherwise prohibit it. In our experiments our approach obtains comparable performance to a baseline in terms of return and number of episodes required to learn, but achieves that performance with as few as 20% of the rewards.

Abstract: Sequential decision-making in high-dimensional continuous action spaces, particularly in stochastic environments, faces significant computational challenges. We explore this challenge in the traditional offline RL setting, where an agent must learn how to make decisions based on data collected through a stochastic behavior policy. We present \textit{Latent Macro Action Planner} (L-MAP), which addresses this challenge by learning a set of temporally extended macro-actions through a state-conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), effectively reducing action dimensionality. L-MAP employs a (separate) learned prior model that acts as a latent transition model and allows efficient sampling of plausible actions. During planning, our approach accounts for stochasticity in both the environment and the behavior policy by using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). In offline RL settings, including stochastic continuous control tasks, L-MAP efficiently searches over discrete latent actions to yield high expected returns. Empirical results demonstrate that L-MAP maintains low decision latency despite increased action dimensionality. Notably, across tasks ranging from continuous control with inherently stochastic dynamics to high-dimensional robotic hand manipulation, L-MAP significantly outperforms existing model-based methods and performs on-par with strong model-free actor-critic baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach in planning in complex and stochastic environments with high-dimensional action spaces.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that LLM performance on reasoning tasks can be enhanced by scaling test-time compute. One promising approach, particularly with decomposable problems, involves arranging intermediate solutions as a graph on which transformations are performed to explore the solution space. However, prior works rely on pre-determined, task-specific transformation schedules which are subject to a set of searched hyperparameters. In this work, we view thought graph transformations as actions in a Markov decision process, and implement policy agents to drive effective action policies for the underlying reasoning LLM agent. In particular, we investigate the ability for another LLM to act as a policy agent on thought graph environments and introduce ARIES, a multi-agent architecture for reasoning with LLMs. In ARIES, reasoning LLM agents solve decomposed subproblems, while policy LLM agents maintain visibility of the thought graph states, and dynamically adapt the problem-solving strategy. Through extensive experiments, we observe that using off-the-shelf LLMs as policy agents with no supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can yield up to $29\%$ higher accuracy on HumanEval relative to static transformation schedules, as well as reducing inference costs by $35\%$ and avoid any search requirements. We also conduct a thorough analysis of observed failure modes, highlighting that limitations on LLM sizes and the depth of problem decomposition can be seen as challenges to scaling LLM-guided reasoning.

Abstract: Training of deep reinforcement learning agents is slowed considerably by the presence of input dimensions that do not usefully condition the reward function. Existing modules such as layer normalization can be trained with weight decay to act as a form of selective attention, i.e. an input mask, that shrinks the scale of unnecessary inputs, which in turn accelerates training of the policy. However, we find a surprising result that adding numerous parameters to the computation of the input mask results in much faster training. A simple, high dimensional masking module is compared with layer normalization and a model without any input suppression. The high dimensional mask resulted in a four-fold speedup in training over the null hypothesis and a two-fold speedup in training over the layer normalization method.

Abstract: A computational ethics framework is essential for AI and autonomous systems operating in complex, real-world environments. Existing approaches often lack the adaptability needed to integrate ethical principles into dynamic and ambiguous contexts, limiting their effectiveness across diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we outline the necessary ingredients for building a holistic, meta-level framework that combines intermediate representations, probabilistic reasoning, and knowledge representation. The specifications therein emphasize scalability, supporting ethical reasoning at both individual decision-making levels and within the collective dynamics of multi-agent systems. By integrating theoretical principles with contextual factors, it facilitates structured and context-aware decision-making, ensuring alignment with overarching ethical standards. We further explore proposed theorems outlining how ethical reasoners should operate, offering a foundation for practical implementation. These constructs aim to support the development of robust and ethically reliable AI systems capable of navigating the complexities of real-world moral decision-making scenarios.

近期，人工智能在音乐内容生成方面的进步催生了高质量模型。然而，对于实时或合作即兴演奏的应用考虑不足，主要因为需要低延迟、沟通计划动作和实时适应用户输入的功能。为此，本文提出了一种名为ReaLJam的接口和协议，用于人类与基于Transformer的强化学习训练的人工智能代理之间的实时音乐即兴演奏会话。通过利用预期概念，使代理能够持续预测表演的发展并视觉化传达其计划给用户。文章进行了用户体验研究，让经验丰富的音乐家通过ReaLJam与该代理进行实时即兴演奏。结果显示，ReaLJam能够支持愉快且具有音乐性的演奏会话，并为未来工作揭示了重要的启示。 <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have created models capable of high-quality musical content generation. However, little consideration is given to how to use these models for real-time or cooperative jamming musical applications because of crucial required features: low latency, the ability to communicate planned actions, and the ability to adapt to user input in real-time. To support these needs, we introduce ReaLJam, an interface and protocol for live musical jamming sessions between a human and a Transformer-based AI agent trained with reinforcement learning. We enable real-time interactions using the concept of anticipation, where the agent continually predicts how the performance will unfold and visually conveys its plan to the user. We conduct a user study where experienced musicians jam in real-time with the agent through ReaLJam. Our results demonstrate that ReaLJam enables enjoyable and musically interesting sessions, and we uncover important takeaways for future work.

Abstract: Persuasive dialogue plays a pivotal role in human communication, influencing various domains. Recent persuasive dialogue datasets often fail to align with real-world interpersonal interactions, leading to unfaithful representations. For instance, unrealistic scenarios may arise, such as when the persuadee explicitly instructs the persuader on which persuasion strategies to employ, with each of the persuadee's questions corresponding to a specific strategy for the persuader to follow. This issue can be attributed to a violation of the "Double Blind" condition, where critical information is fully shared between participants. In actual human interactions, however, key information such as the mental state of the persuadee and the persuasion strategies of the persuader is not directly accessible. The persuader must infer the persuadee's mental state using Theory of Mind capabilities and construct arguments that align with the persuadee's motivations. To address this gap, we introduce ToMMA, a novel multi-agent framework for dialogue generation that is guided by causal Theory of Mind. This framework ensures that information remains undisclosed between agents, preserving "double-blind" conditions, while causal ToM directs the persuader's reasoning, enhancing alignment with human-like persuasion dynamics. Consequently, we present CToMPersu, a multi-domain, multi-turn persuasive dialogue dataset that tackles both double-blind and logical coherence issues, demonstrating superior performance across multiple metrics and achieving better alignment with real human dialogues. Our dataset and prompts are available at https://github.com/DingyiZhang/ToMMA-CToMPersu .

总结:
本文重新审视了强化学习中解决“死三角问题”的经典算法Gradient Temporal Difference (GTD)，该问题涉及off-policy学习与函数逼近和bootstrapping相结合时可能出现的不稳定性。作者发现了一个被早期研究忽视的中间算法——$A^\top$TD的一个变种，称之为$A_t^\top$TD，它也被证明是一种有效的解决方案。相较于需要两套参数和两个学习率的GTD算法，$A_t^\top$TD仅需一组参数和一个学习率，更便于实际应用中的调参。文章对$A_t^\top$TD进行了渐近分析，并对其一变体（加入投影操作）提供了有限样本分析，其收敛速度可与标准的on-policy Temporal Difference学习法相媲美。 <div>

Abstract: Off-policy learning enables a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to reason counterfactually about policies that are not executed and is one of the most important ideas in RL. It, however, can lead to instability when combined with function approximation and bootstrapping, two arguably indispensable ingredients for large-scale reinforcement learning. This is the notorious deadly triad. The seminal work Sutton et al. (2008) pioneers Gradient Temporal Difference learning (GTD) as the first solution to the deadly triad, which has enjoyed massive success thereafter. During the derivation of GTD, some intermediate algorithm, called $A^\top$TD, was invented but soon deemed inferior. In this paper, we revisit this $A^\top$TD and prove that a variant of $A^\top$TD, called $A_t^\top$TD, is also an effective solution to the deadly triad. Furthermore, this $A_t^\top$TD only needs one set of parameters and one learning rate. By contrast, GTD has two sets of parameters and two learning rates, making it hard to tune in practice. We provide asymptotic analysis for $A^\top_t$TD and finite sample analysis for a variant of $A^\top_t$TD that additionally involves a projection operator. The convergence rate of this variant is on par with the canonical on-policy temporal difference learning.

Abstract: In many multi-agent and high-dimensional robotic tasks, controllers can be optimized centrally or decentrally, using either single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL) or multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, the relationship between these two paradigms is not well-studied. This work aims to systematically investigate the robustness and performance of SARL and MARL in the same task. We first analytically show that independent Gaussian policies optimized by policy-gradient based SARL and MARL are equivalent under full-state observations. Following, we empirically show that in certain inherently single-agent tasks, perhaps surprisingly, we can use multiple agents to control a robot such that each agent only has access to partial observations. Since in these cases an agent does not depend on full state information multi-agent policies can provide additional robustness to perturbations and failures. Experiments on an illustrative decentralized control task and a mobile manipulation task with a real robot show that multiple agents with access to partial observations outperform a single agent when parts of the system fail.

Abstract: Social identities play an important role in the dynamics of human societies, and it can be argued that some sense of identification with a larger cause or idea plays a critical role in making humans act responsibly. Often social activists strive to get populations to identify with some cause or notion -- like green energy, diversity, etc. in order to bring about desired social changes. We explore the problem of designing computational models for social identities in the context of autonomous AI agents. For this, we propose an agent model that enables agents to identify with certain notions and show how this affects collective outcomes. We also contrast between associations of identity with rational preferences. The proposed model is simulated in an application context of urban mobility, where we show how changes in social identity affect mobility patterns and collective outcomes.

<br /><br />总结:
本文探讨了在群体决策中同时结合偏好聚合与信息聚合的新型两阶段机制。针对旨在最大化功利主义社会福利的公共项目问题，决策者具有关于备选方案的偏好（通过效用函数表示）和相关信息（以相关于外部福利影响的贝叶斯信号形式存在）。由于激励对齐困难，代理人可能为了操纵决策结果而提供虚假信息或错误报告其偏好。

提出的两阶段机制包括：第一阶段采用赌博机制或预测市场进行信息聚合；第二阶段结合前一阶段的预测结果以及个体偏好，利用近期研究的二次转移机制来选择最佳方案。研究表明，当这两个阶段被巧妙地组合在一起时，整个机制对于各种形式的操纵都具有鲁棒性，并在弱假设下可达到Price of Anarchy性能保证。在两个备选项的情况下，随着人口规模度量的增长，Price of Anarchy趋于1。此外，该机制在大多数情况下还能实现预算平衡。文中还给出了二次转移机制的第一个非渐近Price of Anarchy保证结果，这是一个独立的研究成果。 <div>

Abstract: When making a decision as a group, there are two primary paradigms: aggregating preferences (e.g. voting, mechanism design) and aggregating information (e.g. discussion, consulting, forecasting). Almost all formally-studied group decisionmaking mechanisms fall under one paradigm or the other, but not both. We consider a public projects problem with the objective of maximizing utilitarian social welfare. Decisionmakers have both preferences, modeled as utility functions over the alternatives; and information, modeled as Bayesian signals relevant to the alternatives' external welfare impact. Aligning incentives is highly challenging because, on the one hand, agents can provide bad information in order to manipulate the mechanism into satisfying their preferences; and on the other hand, they can misreport their preferences to favor selection of an alternative for which their information rewards are high.
  We propose a two-stage mechanism for this problem. The forecasting stage aggregates information using either a wagering mechanism or a prediction market (the mechanism is modular and compatible with both). The voting stage aggregates preferences, together with the forecasts from the previous stage, and selects an alternative by leveraging the recently-studied Quadratic Transfers Mechanism. We show that, when carefully combined, the entire two-stage mechanism is robust to manipulation of all forms, and under weak assumptions, satisfies Price of Anarchy guarantees. In the case of two alternatives, the Price of Anarchy tends to 1 as natural measures of the "size" of the population grow large. In most cases, the mechanisms achieve a balanced budget as well. We also give the first nonasymptotic Price of Anarchy guarantee for the Quadratic Transfers Mechanism, a result of independent interest.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language model-driven autonomous agents have revealed that multi-agent collaboration often surpasses each individual through collective reasoning. Inspired by the neural scaling law--increasing neurons enhances performance, this study explores whether the continuous addition of collaborative agents can yield similar benefits. Technically, we utilize directed acyclic graphs to organize agents into a multi-agent collaboration network (MacNet), upon which their interactive reasoning is topologically orchestrated for autonomous task solving. Extensive evaluations reveal that it effectively supports collaboration among over a thousand agents, with irregular topologies outperforming regular ones. We also identify a collaborative scaling law--the overall performance follows a logistic growth pattern as agents scale, with collaborative emergence occurring earlier than traditional neural emergence. We speculate this may be because scaling agents catalyzes their multidimensional considerations during interactive reflection and refinement, thereby producing more comprehensive artifacts.

Abstract: It has previously been shown that by using reinforcement learning (RL), agents can derive simple approximate and exact-restricted numeral systems that are similar to human ones (Carlsson, 2021). However, it is a major challenge to show how more complex recursive numeral systems, similar to for example English, could arise via a simple learning mechanism such as RL. Here, we introduce an approach towards deriving a mechanistic explanation of the emergence of efficient recursive number systems. We consider pairs of agents learning how to communicate about numerical quantities through a meta-grammar that can be gradually modified throughout the interactions. %We find that the seminal meta-grammar of Hurford (Hurford, 1975) is not suitable for this application as its optimization results in systems that deviate from standard conventions observed within human numeral systems. We propose a simple modification which addresses this issue. Utilising a slightly modified version of the meta-grammar of Hurford, we demonstrate that our RL agents, shaped by the pressures for efficient communication, can effectively modify their lexicon towards Pareto-optimal configurations which are comparable to those observed within human numeral systems in terms of their efficiency.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, accurate motion prediction is crucial for safe and efficient motion planning. To ensure safety, planners require reliable uncertainty estimates of the predicted behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. In particular, decomposing uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components is essential for distinguishing between inherent environmental randomness and model uncertainty, thereby enabling more robust and informed decision-making. This paper addresses the challenge of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction with a holistic approach that emphasizes uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the impact of model composition. Our method, grounded in information theory, provides a theoretically principled way to measure uncertainty and decompose it into aleatoric and epistemic components. Unlike prior work, our approach is compatible with state-of-the-art motion predictors, allowing for broader applicability. We demonstrate its utility by conducting extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, which shows how different architectures and configurations influence uncertainty quantification and model robustness.

Abstract: Autonomous agents have demonstrated significant potential in automating complex multistep decision-making tasks. However, even state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o, still fall short of human-level performance, particularly in intricate web environments and long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we present ExACT, an approach to combine test-time search and self-learning to build o1-like models for agentic applications. We first introduce Reflective Monte Carlo Tree Search (R-MCTS), a novel test time algorithm designed to enhance AI agents' ability to explore decision space on the fly. R-MCTS extends traditional MCTS by 1) incorporating contrastive reflection, allowing agents to learn from past interactions and dynamically improve their search efficiency; and 2) using multi-agent debate for reliable state evaluation. Next, we introduce Exploratory Learning, a novel learning strategy to teach agents to search at inference time without relying on any external search algorithms. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, our GPT-4o based R-MCTS agent achieves a 6% to 30% relative improvement across various tasks compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Additionally, we show that the knowledge and experience gained from test-time search can be effectively transferred back to GPT-4o via fine-tuning. After Exploratory Learning, GPT-4o 1) demonstrates the ability to explore the environment, evaluate a state, and backtrack to viable ones when it detects that the current state cannot lead to success, and 2) matches 87% of R-MCTS's performance while using significantly less compute. Notably, our work demonstrates the compute scaling properties in both training - data collection with R-MCTS - and testing time. These results suggest a promising research direction to enhance VLMs' capabilities for agentic applications via test-time search and self-learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the development of intelligent applications and systems such as LLM-based agents and agent operating systems (AIOS). However, when these applications and systems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains the traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise commands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as users are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic file names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file system ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional approaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management. At the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file management functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update monitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level, we store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement syscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered by vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant improvements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the diversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file operations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more intelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version comparison, further enhancing its capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an algorithm designed to address the problem of time-optimal formation reshaping in three-dimensional environments while preventing collisions between agents. The utility of the proposed approach is particularly evident in mobile robotics, where agents benefit from being organized and navigated in formation for a variety of real-world applications requiring frequent alterations in formation shape for efficient navigation or task completion. Given the constrained operational time inherent to battery-powered mobile robots, the time needed to complete the formation reshaping process is crucial for their efficient operation, especially in case of multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed Collision-Aware Time-Optimal formation Reshaping Algorithm (CAT-ORA) builds upon the Hungarian algorithm for the solution of the robot-to-goal assignment implementing the inter-agent collision avoidance through direct constraints on mutually exclusive robot-goal pairs combined with a trajectory generation approach minimizing the duration of the reshaping process. Theoretical validations confirm the optimality of CAT-ORA, with its efficacy further showcased through simulations, and a real-world outdoor experiment involving 19 UAVs. Thorough numerical analysis shows the potential of CAT-ORA to decrease the time required to perform complex formation reshaping tasks by up to 49%, and 12% on average compared to commonly used methods in randomly generated scenarios.

Abstract: The BrowserGym ecosystem addresses the growing need for efficient evaluation and benchmarking of web agents, particularly those leveraging automation and Large Language Models (LLMs). Many existing benchmarks suffer from fragmentation and inconsistent evaluation methodologies, making it challenging to achieve reliable comparisons and reproducible results. In an earlier work, Drouin et al. (2024) introduced BrowserGym which aims to solve this by providing a unified, gym-like environment with well-defined observation and action spaces, facilitating standardized evaluation across diverse benchmarks. We propose an extended BrowserGym-based ecosystem for web agent research, which unifies existing benchmarks from the literature and includes AgentLab, a complementary framework that aids in agent creation, testing, and analysis. Our proposed ecosystem offers flexibility for integrating new benchmarks while ensuring consistent evaluation and comprehensive experiment management. As a supporting evidence, we conduct the first large-scale, multi-benchmark web agent experiment and compare the performance of 6 state-of-the-art LLMs across 6 popular web agent benchmarks made available in BrowserGym. Among other findings, our results highlight a large discrepancy between OpenAI and Anthropic's latests models, with Claude-3.5-Sonnet leading the way on almost all benchmarks, except on vision-related tasks where GPT-4o is superior. Despite these advancements, our results emphasize that building robust and efficient web agents remains a significant challenge, due to the inherent complexity of real-world web environments and the limitations of current models.

<div> 关键词：Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF)，语言指导导航学习，数据集，导航器，指令生成器

<br /><br />总结：
本文介绍了用于训练稳健的语言指令代理的Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF)方法。SRDF通过循环迭代的方式，无需人工标注，让指令生成器和导航器协同工作，不断优化导航指令轨迹对的数据集。首先使用基础生成器创建初始数据池来训练基础导航器，再利用该导航器筛选并优化数据池。如此往复，形成了一个数据自我精炼的过程，从而得到大规模、高质量的语言引导导航学习数据集。实验结果显示，经过几轮flywheel后，导航器在经典R2R测试集上的SPL性能从70%提升到78%，首次超越了人类表现（76%）。同时，这一过程也使得指令生成器得到了显著提升，SPICE得分从23.5提高到26.2，超过了以往所有的VLN指令生成方法。最后，文章还展示了该方法的可扩展性和泛化能力，其预训练导航器在各种下游导航任务中均大幅度超越了当前最优的方法。 <div>

Abstract: Creating high-quality data for training robust language-instructed agents is a long-lasting challenge in embodied AI. In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are an effective approach for addressing non-Markovian rewards in reinforcement learning (RL) through finite-state machines. Traditional RMs, which label edges with propositional logic formulae, inherit the limited expressivity of propositional logic. This limitation hinders the learnability and transferability of RMs since complex tasks will require numerous states and edges. To overcome these challenges, we propose First-Order Reward Machines ($\texttt{FORM}$s), which use first-order logic to label edges, resulting in more compact and transferable RMs. We introduce a novel method for $\textbf{learning}$ $\texttt{FORM}$s and a multi-agent formulation for $\textbf{exploiting}$ them and facilitate their transferability, where multiple agents collaboratively learn policies for a shared $\texttt{FORM}$. Our experimental results demonstrate the scalability of $\texttt{FORM}$s with respect to traditional RMs. Specifically, we show that $\texttt{FORM}$s can be effectively learnt for tasks where traditional RM learning approaches fail. We also show significant improvements in learning speed and task transferability thanks to the multi-agent learning framework and the abstraction provided by the first-order language.

Abstract: Strategic interactions can be represented more concisely, and analyzed and solved more efficiently, if we are aware of the symmetries within the multiagent system. Symmetries also have conceptual implications, for example for equilibrium selection. We study the computational complexity of identifying and using symmetries. Using the classical framework of normal-form games, we consider game symmetries that can be across some or all players and/or actions. We find a strong connection between game symmetries and graph automorphisms, yielding graph automorphism and graph isomorphism completeness results for characterizing the symmetries present in a game. On the other hand, we also show that the problem becomes polynomial-time solvable when we restrict the consideration of actions in one of two ways.
  Next, we investigate when exactly game symmetries can be successfully leveraged for Nash equilibrium computation. We show that finding a Nash equilibrium that respects a given set of symmetries is PPAD- and CLS-complete in general-sum and team games respectively -- that is, exactly as hard as Brouwer fixed point and gradient descent problems. Finally, we present polynomial-time methods for the special cases where we are aware of a vast number of symmetries, or where the game is two-player zero-sum and we do not even know the symmetries.

本文关注未来LLM（大型语言模型）代理在涉及长期计划和相互依赖目标的任务中代表用户与其他实体代理进行沟通的问题。文章首先指出了此类代理网络所需的通信特性，应具备主动性与适应性，并强调了两个关键需求：隐私（仅分享完成任务所需信息）和安全（确保通信的完整性和对抗自私实体的能力）。作者通过设计一个旅行规划的示例用例来展示这些要求及其可能存在的问题。接下来，文章提出了一种实用的设计方案，该方案受到网络安全原则启发，为受限的LLM代理网络提供了一个平衡适应性、安全性和隐私性的框架。该框架自动从先前的模拟构建并更新任务特定规则以建立防火墙，并提供了三层防御机制：将自由形式输入转化为任务特定协议、动态抽象用户的任务数据至适当的许可程度以及自我校正代理的行为轨迹。 <div>

Abstract: Future LLM agents are likely to communicate on behalf of users with other entity-representing agents on tasks that entail long-horizon plans with interdependent goals. Current work does not focus on such agentic networks, nor does it address their challenges. Thus, we first identify the required properties of agents' communication, which should be proactive and adaptable. It needs to satisfy 1) privacy: agents should not share more than what is needed for the task, and 2) security: the communication must preserve integrity and maintain utility against selfish entities. We design a use case (travel planning) as a testbed that exemplifies these requirements, and we show examples of how this can go wrong. Next, we propose a practical design, inspired by established network security principles, for constrained LLM agentic networks that balance adaptability, security, and privacy. Our framework automatically constructs and updates task-specific rules from prior simulations to build firewalls. We offer layers of defense to 1) convert free-form input to a task-specific protocol, 2) dynamically abstract users' data to a task-specific degree of permissiveness, and 3) self-correct the agents' trajectory.

Abstract: Usability testing is a fundamental yet challenging (e.g., inflexible to iterate the study design flaws and hard to recruit study participants) research method for user experience (UX) researchers to evaluate a web design. Recent advances in Large Language Model-simulated Agent (LLM-Agent) research inspired us to design UXAgent to support UX researchers in evaluating and reiterating their usability testing study design before they conduct the real human subject study. Our system features an LLM-Agent module and a universal browser connector module so that UX researchers can automatically generate thousands of simulated users to test the target website. The results are shown in qualitative (e.g., interviewing how an agent thinks ), quantitative (e.g., # of actions), and video recording formats for UX researchers to analyze. Through a heuristic user evaluation with five UX researchers, participants praised the innovation of our system but also expressed concerns about the future of LLM Agent-assisted UX study.

Abstract: With the advent of novel cancer treatment options such as immunotherapy, studying the tumour immune micro-environment (TIME) is crucial to inform on prognosis and understand potential response to therapeutic agents. A key approach to characterising the TIME may be through combining (1) digitised microscopic high-resolution optical images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained tissue sections obtained in routine histopathology examinations with (2) automated immune cell detection and classification methods. In this work, we introduce a workflow to automatically generate robust single cell contours and labels from dually stained tissue sections with H&amp;E and multiplexed immunofluorescence (IF) markers. The approach harnesses the Segment Anything Model and requires minimal human intervention compared to existing single cell databases. With this methodology, we create Immunocto, a massive, multi-million automatically generated database of 6,848,454 human cells and objects, including 2,282,818 immune cells distributed across 4 subtypes: CD4$^+$ T cell lymphocytes, CD8$^+$ T cell lymphocytes, CD20$^+$ B cell lymphocytes, and CD68$^+$/CD163$^+$ macrophages. For each cell, we provide a 64$\times$64 pixels$^2$ H&amp;E image at $\mathbf{40}\times$ magnification, along with a binary mask of the nucleus and a label. The database, which is made publicly available, can be used to train models to study the TIME on routine H&amp;E slides. We show that deep learning models trained on Immunocto result in state-of-the-art performance for lymphocyte detection. The approach demonstrates the benefits of using matched H&amp;E and IF data to generate robust databases for computational pathology applications.

Abstract: The intrinsic high dimension of fluid dynamics is an inherent challenge to control of aerodynamic flows, and this is further complicated by a flow's nonlinear response to strong disturbances. Deep reinforcement learning, which takes advantage of the exploratory aspects of reinforcement learning (RL) and the rich nonlinearity of a deep neural network, provides a promising approach to discover feasible control strategies. However, the typical model-free approach to reinforcement learning requires a significant amount of interaction between the flow environment and the RL agent during training, and this high training cost impedes its development and application. In this work, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approach by incorporating a novel reduced-order model as a surrogate for the full environment. The model consists of a physics-augmented autoencoder, which compresses high-dimensional CFD flow field snaphsots into a three-dimensional latent space, and a latent dynamics model that is trained to accurately predict the long-time dynamics of trajectories in the latent space in response to action sequences. The accuracy and robustness of the model are demonstrated in the scenario of a pitching airfoil within a highly disturbed environment. Additionally, an application to a vertical-axis wind turbine in a disturbance-free environment is discussed in the Appendix Based on the model trained in the pitching airfoil problem, we realize an MBRL strategy to mitigate lift variation during gust-airfoil encounters. We demonstrate that the policy learned in the reduced-order environment translates to an effective control strategy in the full CFD environment.

Abstract: The language generation and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have enabled conversational systems with impressive performance in a variety of tasks, from code generation, to composing essays, to passing STEM and legal exams, to a new paradigm for knowledge search. Besides those short-term use applications, LLMs are increasingly used to help with real-life goals or tasks that take a long time to complete, involving multiple sessions across days, weeks, months, or even years. Thus to enable conversational systems for long term interactions and tasks, we need language-based agents that can plan for long horizons. Traditionally, such capabilities were addressed by reinforcement learning agents with hierarchical planning capabilities. In this work, we explore a novel architecture where the LLM acts as the meta-controller deciding the agent's next macro-action, and tool use augmented LLM-based option policies execute the selected macro-action. We instantiate this framework for a specific set of macro-actions enabling adaptive planning for users' personal plans through conversation and follow-up questions collecting user feedback. We show how this paradigm can be applicable in scenarios ranging from tutoring for academic and non-academic tasks to conversational coaching for personal health plans.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of satellite inspection, where one or more satellites (inspectors) are tasked with imaging or inspecting a resident space object (RSO) due to potential malfunctions or anomalies. Inspection strategies are often reduced to a discretized action space with predefined waypoints, facilitating tractability in both classical optimization and machine learning based approaches. However, this discretization can lead to suboptimal guidance in certain scenarios. This study presents a comparative simulation to explore the tradeoffs of passive versus active strategies in multi-agent missions. Key factors considered include RSO dynamic mode, state uncertainty, unmodeled entrance criteria, and inspector motion types. The evaluation is conducted with a focus on fuel utilization and surface coverage. Building on a Monte-Carlo based evaluator of passive strategies and a reinforcement learning framework for training active inspection policies, this study investigates conditions under which passive strategies, such as Natural Motion Circumnavigation (NMC), may perform comparably to active strategies like Reinforcement Learning based waypoint transfers.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate - multiple instances of large language models discussing problems in turn-based interaction - has shown promise for solving knowledge and reasoning tasks. However, these methods show limitations, particularly when scaling them to longer reasoning chains. In this study, we unveil a new issue of multi-agent debate: discussions drift away from the initial problem over multiple turns. We define this phenomenon as problem drift and quantify its presence across ten tasks (i.e., three generative, three knowledge, three reasoning, and one instruction-following task). To identify the reasons for this issue, we perform a human study with eight experts on discussions suffering from problem drift, who find the most common issues are a lack of progress (35% of cases), low-quality feedback (26% of cases), and a lack of clarity (25% of cases). To systematically address the issue of problem drift, we propose DRIFTJudge, a method based on LLM-as-a-judge, to detect problem drift at test-time. We further propose DRIFTPolicy, a method to mitigate 31% of problem drift cases. Our study can be seen as a first step to understanding a key limitation of multi-agent debate, highlighting pathways for improving their effectiveness in the future.

Abstract: Multi-agent neural implicit mapping allows robots to collaboratively capture and reconstruct complex environments with high fidelity. However, existing approaches often rely on synchronous communication, which is impractical in real-world scenarios with limited bandwidth and potential communication interruptions. This paper introduces RAMEN: Real-time Asynchronous Multi-agEnt Neural implicit mapping, a novel approach designed to address this challenge. RAMEN employs an uncertainty-weighted multi-agent consensus optimization algorithm that accounts for communication disruptions. When communication is lost between a pair of agents, each agent retains only an outdated copy of its neighbor's map, with the uncertainty of this copy increasing over time since the last communication. Using gradient update information, we quantify the uncertainty associated with each parameter of the neural network map. Neural network maps from different agents are brought to consensus on the basis of their levels of uncertainty, with consensus biased towards network parameters with lower uncertainty. To achieve this, we derive a weighted variant of the decentralized consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (C-ADMM) algorithm, facilitating robust collaboration among agents with varying communication and update frequencies. Through extensive evaluations on real-world datasets and robot hardware experiments, we demonstrate RAMEN's superior mapping performance under challenging communication conditions.

Abstract: Many real-world eligibility problems, ranging from medical diagnosis to tax planning, can be mapped to decision problems expressed in natural language, wherein a model must make a binary choice based on user features. Large-scale domains such as legal codes or frequently updated funding opportunities render human annotation (e.g., web forms or decision trees) impractical, highlighting the need for agents that can automatically assist in decision-making. Since relevant information is often only known to the user, it is crucial that these agents ask the right questions. As agents determine when to terminate a conversation, they face a trade-off between accuracy and the number of questions asked, a key metric for both user experience and cost. To evaluate this task, we propose BeNYfits, a new benchmark for determining user eligibility for multiple overlapping social benefits opportunities through interactive decision-making. Our experiments show that current language models struggle with frequent hallucinations, with GPT-4o scoring only 35.7 F1 using a ReAct-style chain-of-thought. To address this, we introduce ProADA, a novel approach that leverages program synthesis to assist in decision-making by mapping dialog planning to a code generation problem and using gaps in structured data to determine the best next action. Our agent, ProADA, improves the F1 score to 55.6 while maintaining nearly the same number of dialog turns.

Abstract: The vast and complex materials design space demands innovative strategies to integrate multidisciplinary scientific knowledge and optimize materials discovery. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising reasoning and automation capabilities across various domains, their application in materials science remains limited due to a lack of benchmarking standards and practical implementation frameworks. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture-of-Workflows for Self-Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CRAG-MoW) - a novel paradigm that orchestrates multiple agentic workflows employing distinct CRAG strategies using open-source LLMs. Unlike prior approaches, CRAG-MoW synthesizes diverse outputs through an orchestration agent, enabling direct evaluation of multiple LLMs across the same problem domain. We benchmark CRAG-MoWs across small molecules, polymers, and chemical reactions, as well as multi-modal nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral retrieval. Our results demonstrate that CRAG-MoWs achieve performance comparable to GPT-4o while being preferred more frequently in comparative evaluations, highlighting the advantage of structured retrieval and multi-agent synthesis. By revealing performance variations across data types, CRAG-MoW provides a scalable, interpretable, and benchmark-driven approach to optimizing AI architectures for materials discovery. These insights are pivotal in addressing fundamental gaps in benchmarking LLMs and autonomous AI agents for scientific applications.

总结:
为应对不确定性与模拟到现实的差距，鲁棒强化学习（robust RL）致力于提升智能体与环境交互中的适应性。然而，目前缺乏统一标准的鲁棒RL基准测试平台。现有的鲁棒RL策略多关注某一特定类型的不确定性并仅在特定环境中进行验证。本文提出了一个名为Robust-Gymnasium的统一模块化基准测试平台，该平台旨在支持对RL的所有关键组件——观察状态、奖励、智能体动作以及环境——的各种干扰类型。Robust-Gymnasium包含了六十多个涵盖控制、机器人学、安全RL和多智能体RL等领域的多样化任务环境，为社区提供了一个开源、用户友好的工具，以便评估现有方法并促进鲁棒RL算法的发展。此外，文中还在这一框架下对现有的标准和鲁棒RL算法进行了基准测试，揭示了它们各自的重大不足，并提供了新的洞见。<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Driven by inherent uncertainty and the sim-to-real gap, robust reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to improve resilience against the complexity and variability in agent-environment sequential interactions. Despite the existence of a large number of RL benchmarks, there is a lack of standardized benchmarks for robust RL. Current robust RL policies often focus on a specific type of uncertainty and are evaluated in distinct, one-off environments. In this work, we introduce Robust-Gymnasium, a unified modular benchmark designed for robust RL that supports a wide variety of disruptions across all key RL components-agents' observed state and reward, agents' actions, and the environment. Offering over sixty diverse task environments spanning control and robotics, safe RL, and multi-agent RL, it provides an open-source and user-friendly tool for the community to assess current methods and foster the development of robust RL algorithms. In addition, we benchmark existing standard and robust RL algorithms within this framework, uncovering significant deficiencies in each and offering new insights.

Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems offer high spectral efficiency (SE) through multiple distributed access points (APs). However, the large number of antennas increases power consumption. We propose incorporating stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) into CF mMIMO systems as a cost-effective, energy-efficient solution. This paper focuses on optimizing the joint power allocation of APs and the phase shift of SIMs to maximize the sum SE. To address this complex problem, we introduce a fully distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm. Our novel algorithm, the noisy value method with a recurrent policy in multi-agent policy optimization (NVR-MAPPO), enhances performance by encouraging diverse exploration under centralized training and decentralized execution. Simulations demonstrate that NVR-MAPPO significantly improves sum SE and robustness across various scenarios.

Abstract: In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), well-designed communication protocols can effectively facilitate consensus among agents, thereby enhancing task performance. Moreover, in large-scale multi-agent systems commonly found in real-world applications, effective communication plays an even more critical role due to the escalated challenge of partial observability compared to smaller-scale setups. In this work, we endeavor to develop a scalable communication protocol for MARL. Unlike previous methods that focus on selecting optimal pairwise communication links-a task that becomes increasingly complex as the number of agents grows-we adopt a global perspective on communication topology design. Specifically, we propose utilizing the exponential topology to enable rapid information dissemination among agents by leveraging its small-diameter and small-size properties. This approach leads to a scalable communication protocol, named ExpoComm. To fully unlock the potential of exponential graphs as communication topologies, we employ memory-based message processors and auxiliary tasks to ground messages, ensuring that they reflect global information and benefit decision-making. Extensive experiments on large-scale cooperative benchmarks, including MAgent and Infrastructure Management Planning, demonstrate the superior performance and robust zero-shot transferability of ExpoComm compared to existing communication strategies. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/LXXXXR/ExpoComm.

总结：
本文提出了一种名为MIND（Multi-agent INner Dialogue）的新颖心理治疗范式，旨在解决当前社会日益严重的心理健康问题，如抑郁和焦虑。传统治疗方法如咨询和聊天机器人往往无法提供具有情感深度的有效互动。虽然大型语言模型（LLMs）有能力创造更接近人类的交互体验，但它们仍难以捕捉微妙的情绪变化。为弥补这一不足，MIND利用LLMs强大的生成能力和角色扮演能力，预设了一个互动治疗框架，并将LLM代理分配到不同的角色中，与用户进行内在对话，从而提供沉浸式的治疗体验。通过在多种实际治疗场景下进行广泛的人类实验，结果表明MIND比传统方法提供了更为用户友好的体验，有效地利用了LLMs在心理治疗方面的巨大潜力。 <div>

Abstract: Mental health issues are worsening in today's competitive society, such as depression and anxiety. Traditional healings like counseling and chatbots fail to engage effectively, they often provide generic responses lacking emotional depth. Although large language models (LLMs) have the potential to create more human-like interactions, they still struggle to capture subtle emotions. This requires LLMs to be equipped with human-like adaptability and warmth. To fill this gap, we propose the MIND (Multi-agent INner Dialogue), a novel paradigm that provides more immersive psychological healing environments. Considering the strong generative and role-playing ability of LLM agents, we predefine an interactive healing framework and assign LLM agents different roles within the framework to engage in interactive inner dialogues with users, thereby providing an immersive healing experience. We conduct extensive human experiments in various real-world healing dimensions, and find that MIND provides a more user-friendly experience than traditional paradigms. This demonstrates that MIND effectively leverages the significant potential of LLMs in psychological healing.

Abstract: Motor skill learning often requires experienced professionals who can provide personalized instruction. Unfortunately, the availability of high-quality training can be limited for specialized tasks, such as high performance racing. Several recent works have leveraged AI-assistance to improve instruction of tasks ranging from rehabilitation to surgical robot tele-operation. However, these works often make simplifying assumptions on the student learning process, and fail to model how a teacher's assistance interacts with different individuals' abilities when determining optimal teaching strategies. Inspired by the idea of scaffolding from educational psychology, we leverage shared autonomy, a framework for combining user inputs with robot autonomy, to aid with curriculum design. Our key insight is that the way a student's behavior improves in the presence of assistance from an autonomous agent can highlight which sub-skills might be most ``learnable'' for the student, or within their Zone of Proximal Development. We use this to design Z-COACH, a method for using shared autonomy to provide personalized instruction targeting interpretable task sub-skills. In a user study (n=50), where we teach high performance racing in a simulated environment of the Thunderhill Raceway Park with the CARLA Autonomous Driving simulator, we show that Z-COACH helps identify which skills each student should first practice, leading to an overall improvement in driving time, behavior, and smoothness. Our work shows that increasingly available semi-autonomous capabilities (e.g. in vehicles, robots) can not only assist human users, but also help *teach* them.

Abstract: Building an agent that can mimic human behavior patterns to accomplish various open-world tasks is a long-term goal. To enable agents to effectively learn behavioral patterns across diverse tasks, a key challenge lies in modeling the intricate relationships among observations, actions, and language. To this end, we propose Optimus-2, a novel Minecraft agent that incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for high-level planning, alongside a Goal-Observation-Action Conditioned Policy (GOAP) for low-level control. GOAP contains (1) an Action-guided Behavior Encoder that models causal relationships between observations and actions at each timestep, then dynamically interacts with the historical observation-action sequence, consolidating it into fixed-length behavior tokens, and (2) an MLLM that aligns behavior tokens with open-ended language instructions to predict actions auto-regressively. Moreover, we introduce a high-quality Minecraft Goal-Observation-Action (MGOA)} dataset, which contains 25,000 videos across 8 atomic tasks, providing about 30M goal-observation-action pairs. The automated construction method, along with the MGOA dataset, can contribute to the community's efforts to train Minecraft agents. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Optimus-2 exhibits superior performance across atomic tasks, long-horizon tasks, and open-ended instruction tasks in Minecraft.

Abstract: To improve Multimodal Large Language Models' (MLLMs) ability to process images and complex instructions, researchers predominantly curate large-scale visual instruction tuning datasets, which are either sourced from existing vision tasks or synthetically generated using LLMs and image descriptions. However, they often suffer from critical flaws, including misaligned instruction-image pairs and low-quality images. Such issues hinder training efficiency and limit performance improvements, as models waste resources on noisy or irrelevant data with minimal benefit to overall capability. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{Vi}sual-Centric \textbf{S}election approach via \textbf{A}gents Collaboration (ViSA), which centers on image quality assessment and image-instruction relevance evaluation. Specifically, our approach consists of 1) an image information quantification method via visual agents collaboration to select images with rich visual information, and 2) a visual-centric instruction quality assessment method to select high-quality instruction data related to high-quality images. Finally, we reorganize 80K instruction data from large open-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViSA outperforms or is comparable to current state-of-the-art models on seven benchmarks, using only 2.5\% of the original data, highlighting the efficiency of our data selection approach. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/ViSA.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel data-driven approach for approximating the $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in continuous-time linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) games, where multiple agents interact with each other through their dynamics and infinite horizon discounted costs. The core of our method involves solving two algebraic Riccati equations (AREs) and an ordinary differential equation (ODE) using state and input samples collected from agents, eliminating the need for a priori knowledge of their dynamical models. The standard ARE is addressed through an integral reinforcement learning (IRL) technique, while the nonsymmetric ARE and the ODE are resolved by identifying the drift coefficients of the agents' dynamics under general conditions. Moreover, by imposing specific conditions on models, we extend the IRL-based approach to approximately solve the nonsymmetric ARE. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: The FOX optimizer, inspired by red fox hunting behavior, is a powerful algorithm for solving real-world and engineering problems. However, despite balancing exploration and exploitation, it can prematurely converge to local optima, as agent positions are updated solely based on the current best-known position, causing all agents to converge on one location. This study proposes the modified FOX optimizer (mFOX) to enhance exploration and balance exploration and exploitation in three steps. First, the Oppositional-Based Learning (OBL) strategy is used to improve the initial population. Second, control parameters are refined to achieve a better balance between exploration and exploitation. Third, a new update equation is introduced, allowing agents to adjust their positions relative to one another rather than relying solely on the best-known position. This approach improves exploration efficiency without adding complexity. The mFOX algorithm's performance is evaluated against 12 well-known algorithms on 23 classical benchmark functions, 10 CEC2019 functions, and 12 CEC2022 functions. It outperforms competitors in 74% of the classical benchmarks, 60% of the CEC2019 benchmarks, and 58% of the CEC2022 benchmarks. Additionally, mFOX effectively addresses four engineering problems. These results demonstrate mFOX's strong competitiveness in solving complex optimization tasks, including unimodal, constrained, and high-dimensional problems.

Abstract: This paper studies linear quadratic Gaussian robust mean field social control problems in the presence of multiplicative noise. We aim to compute asymptotic decentralized strategies without requiring full prior knowledge of agents' dynamics. The primary challenges lie in solving an indefinite stochastic algebraic Riccati equation for feedback gains, and an indefinite algebraic Riccati equation for feedforward gains. To overcome these challenges, we first propose a unified dual-loop iterative framework that simultaneously handles both indefinite Riccati-type equations, and provide rigorous convergence proofs for both outer-loop and inner-loop iterations. Second, recognizing that biases may arise in iterative processes due to estimation and modeling errors, we analyze the robustness of the proposed algorithm by using the small-disturbance input-to-state stability technique. This ensures convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution, even in the existence of disturbances. Finally, to address the limitation of requiring precise knowledge of agents' dynamics, we employ the integral reinforcement learning technique to develop a data-driven method within the dual-loop iterative framework. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), navigating for EV drivers to select a cost-effective charging station has become an important yet challenging issue due to dynamic traffic conditions, fluctuating electricity prices, and potential competition from other EVs. The state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms for solving this task still require global information about all EVs at the execution stage, which not only increases communication costs but also raises privacy issues among EV drivers. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce a novel generative model-enhanced multi-agent DRL algorithm that utilizes only the EV's local information while achieving performance comparable to these state-of-the-art algorithms. Specifically, the policy network is implemented on the EV side, and a Conditional Variational Autoencoder-Long Short Term Memory (CVAE-LSTM)-based recommendation model is developed to provide recommendation information. Furthermore, a novel future charging competition encoder is designed to effectively compress global information, enhancing training performance. The multi-gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) is also utilized to adaptively balance the weight between the two parts of the training objective, resulting in a more stable training process. Simulations are conducted based on a practical area in Xi\'an, China. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm, which relies on local information, outperforms existing local information-based methods and achieves less than 8\% performance loss compared to global information-based methods.

<div> 关键词: 大型语言模型、多智能体系统、Collab-Overcooked、自然语言通信、评价指标

总结:
本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的多智能体系统（LLM-MAS）新基准——Collab-Overcooked，该基准是在流行的Overcooked-AI游戏基础上构建的，旨在生成更具挑战性的互动环境任务。Collab-Overcooked在现有基准上进行了两个方面的扩展：一是提供了一个支持多样化任务和目标并鼓励通过自然语言进行协作的多智能体框架；二是引入了一系列过程导向的评价指标，以评估不同LLM代理在精细协作能力上的表现，这是以往工作中常被忽视的一个维度。实验结果显示，虽然LLMs在目标解释方面表现出较强的能力，但在主动协作和持续适应等完成复杂任务的关键环节上存在显著差距。此外，文章指出了LLM-MAS的优势和不足，并为改进和评价LLM-MAS提供了一个统一、开源的基准。Collab-Overcooked项目包括公开发布的环境、30个开放性任务及综合评价工具包，现已在https://github.com/YusaeMeow/Collab-Overcooked上公开可用。 <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based agent systems have made great strides in real-world applications beyond traditional NLP tasks. This paper proposes a new LLM-powered Multi-Agent System (LLM-MAS) benchmark, Collab-Overcooked, built on the popular Overcooked-AI game with more applicable and challenging tasks in interactive environments. Collab-Overcooked extends existing benchmarks from two novel perspectives. First, it provides a multi-agent framework supporting diverse tasks and objectives and encourages collaboration through natural language communication. Second, it introduces a spectrum of process-oriented evaluation metrics to assess the fine-grained collaboration capabilities of different LLM agents, a dimension often overlooked in prior work. We conduct extensive experiments over 10 popular LLMs and show that, while the LLMs present a strong ability in goal interpretation, there is a significant discrepancy in active collaboration and continuous adaption that are critical for efficiently fulfilling complicated tasks. Notably, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-MAS and provide insights for improving and evaluating LLM-MAS on a unified and open-sourced benchmark. Environments, 30 open-ended tasks, and an integrated evaluation package are now publicly available at https://github.com/YusaeMeow/Collab-Overcooked.

总结:
本文提出了一种上下文相关的异常检测方法，应用于执行覆盖任务的机器人 Swarm 的物理运动中。该方法使用模拟的 Swarm 正常行为训练一个正常化流模型，以预测机器人在其当前环境上下文中的运动概率。在实际应用中，通过预测观测到的运动概率，结合检测标准来判断机器人行为是否正常或对抗性。文章对五种不同的对抗性行为策略进行了评估，其中提出的最佳检测标准能够准确地将至少 80% 的每种对抗性类型分类出来，同时保持对正常机器人行为的误报率低于 5%。此外，该方法还在硬件实验中得到了验证，结果与模拟场景相似。相较于现有的最优方法，该研究提高了正常化流的预测性能以及检测标准的鲁棒性。 <div>

Abstract: A contextual anomaly detection method is proposed and applied to the physical motions of a robot swarm executing a coverage task. Using simulations of a swarm's normal behavior, a normalizing flow is trained to predict the likelihood of a robot motion within the current context of its environment. During application, the predicted likelihood of the observed motions is used by a detection criterion that categorizes a robot agent as normal or antagonistic. The proposed method is evaluated on five different strategies of antagonistic behavior. Importantly, only readily available simulated data of normal robot behavior is used for training such that the nature of the anomalies need not be known beforehand. The best detection criterion correctly categorizes at least 80% of each antagonistic type while maintaining a false positive rate of less than 5% for normal robot agents. Additionally, the method is validated in hardware experiments, yielding results similar to the simulated scenarios. Compared to the state-of-the-art approach, both the predictive performance of the normalizing flow and the robustness of the detection criterion are increased.

Abstract: Telephone surveys remain a valuable tool for gathering insights but typically require substantial resources in training and coordinating human interviewers. This work presents an AI-driven telephone survey system integrating text-to-speech (TTS), a large language model (LLM), and speech-to-text (STT) that mimics the versatility of human-led interviews on scale.
  We tested the system across two populations, a pilot study in the United States (n = 75) and a large-scale deployment in Peru (n = 2,739), inviting participants via web-based links and contacting them via direct phone calls. The AI agent successfully administered open-ended and closed-ended questions, handled basic clarifications, and dynamically navigated branching logic, allowing fast large-scale survey deployment without interviewer recruitment or training.
  Our findings demonstrate that while the AI system's probing for qualitative depth was more limited than human interviewers, overall data quality approached human-led standards for structured items. This study represents one of the first successful large-scale deployments of an LLM-based telephone interviewer in a real-world survey context. The AI-powered telephone survey system has the potential for expanding scalable, consistent data collecting across market research, social science, and public opinion studies, thus improving operational efficiency while maintaining appropriate data quality for research.

Abstract: As the demands for superior agents grow, the training complexity of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) becomes higher. Thus, accelerating training of DRL has become a major research focus. Dividing the DRL training process into subtasks and using parallel computation can effectively reduce training costs. However, current DRL training systems lack sufficient parallelization due to data assignment between subtask components. This assignment issue has been ignored, but addressing it can further boost training efficiency. Therefore, we propose a high-throughput distributed RL training system called TianJi. It relaxes assignment dependencies between subtask components and enables event-driven asynchronous communication. Meanwhile, TianJi maintains clear boundaries between subtask components. To address convergence uncertainty from relaxed assignment dependencies, TianJi proposes a distributed strategy based on the balance of sample production and consumption. The strategy controls the staleness of samples to correct their quality, ensuring convergence. We conducted extensive experiments. TianJi achieves a convergence time acceleration ratio of up to 4.37 compared to related comparison systems. When scaled to eight computational nodes, TianJi shows a convergence time speedup of 1.6 and a throughput speedup of 7.13 relative to XingTian, demonstrating its capability to accelerate training and scalability. In data transmission efficiency experiments, TianJi significantly outperforms other systems, approaching hardware limits. TianJi also shows effectiveness in on-policy algorithms, achieving convergence time acceleration ratios of 4.36 and 2.95 compared to RLlib and XingTian. TianJi is accessible at https://github.com/HiPRL/TianJi.git.

Abstract: Standpoint linear temporal logic ($SLTL$) is a recently introduced extension of classical linear temporal logic ($LTL$) with standpoint modalities. Intuitively, these modalities allow to express that, from agent $a$'s standpoint, it is conceivable that a given formula holds.
  Besides the standard interpretation of the standpoint modalities we introduce four new semantics, which differ in the information an agent can extract from the history. We provide a general model checking algorithm applicable to $SLTL$ under any of the five semantics. Furthermore we analyze the computational complexity of the corresponding model checking problems, obtaining PSPACE-completeness in three cases, which stands in contrast to the known EXPSPACE-completeness of the $SLTL$ satisfiability problem.

Abstract: In multi-robot exploration, a team of mobile robot is tasked with efficiently mapping an unknown environments. While most exploration planners assume omnidirectional sensors like LiDAR, this is impractical for small robots such as drones, where lightweight, directional sensors like cameras may be the only option due to payload constraints. These sensors have a constrained field-of-view (FoV), which adds complexity to the exploration problem, requiring not only optimal robot positioning but also sensor orientation during movement. In this work, we propose MARVEL, a neural framework that leverages graph attention networks, together with novel frontiers and orientation features fusion technique, to develop a collaborative, decentralized policy using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for robots with constrained FoV. To handle the large action space of viewpoints planning, we further introduce a novel information-driven action pruning strategy. MARVEL improves multi-robot coordination and decision-making in challenging large-scale indoor environments, while adapting to various team sizes and sensor configurations (i.e., FoV and sensor range) without additional training. Our extensive evaluation shows that MARVEL's learned policies exhibit effective coordinated behaviors, outperforming state-of-the-art exploration planners across multiple metrics. We experimentally demonstrate MARVEL's generalizability in large-scale environments, of up to 90m by 90m, and validate its practical applicability through successful deployment on a team of real drone hardware.

Abstract: Dynamic Algorithm Configuration (DAC) has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in the prevalence of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Numerous studies have leveraged the robustness of decision-making in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address the optimization challenges associated with algorithm configuration. However, making an RL agent work properly is a non-trivial task, especially in reward design, which necessitates a substantial amount of handcrafted knowledge based on domain expertise. In this work, we study the importance of reward design in the context of DAC via a case study on controlling the population size of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$-GA optimizing OneMax. We observed that a poorly designed reward can hinder the RL agent's ability to learn an optimal policy because of a lack of exploration, leading to both scalability and learning divergence issues. To address those challenges, we propose the application of a reward shaping mechanism to facilitate enhanced exploration of the environment by the RL agent. Our work not only demonstrates the ability of RL in dynamically configuring the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$-GA, but also confirms the advantages of reward shaping in the scalability of RL agents across various sizes of OneMax problems.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems have gained significant attention for their ability to autonomously perform complex tasks. However, their reliance on well-prepared tools limits their applicability in the medical domain, which requires to train specialized models. In this paper, we make three contributions: (i) We present M3Builder, a novel multi-agent system designed to automate machine learning (ML) in medical imaging. At its core, M3Builder employs four specialized agents that collaborate to tackle complex, multi-step medical ML workflows, from automated data processing and environment configuration to self-contained auto debugging and model training. These agents operate within a medical imaging ML workspace, a structured environment designed to provide agents with free-text descriptions of datasets, training codes, and interaction tools, enabling seamless communication and task execution. (ii) To evaluate progress in automated medical imaging ML, we propose M3Bench, a benchmark comprising four general tasks on 14 training datasets, across five anatomies and three imaging modalities, covering both 2D and 3D data. (iii) We experiment with seven state-of-the-art large language models serving as agent cores for our system, such as Claude series, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek-V3. Compared to existing ML agentic designs, M3Builder shows superior performance on completing ML tasks in medical imaging, achieving a 94.29% success rate using Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the agent core, showing huge potential towards fully automated machine learning in medical imaging.

Abstract: This paper proposes a holistic framework for autonomous guidance, navigation, and task distribution among multi-drone systems operating in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied indoor settings. We advocate for a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based guidance mechanism, utilising the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. To improve the efficiency of the training process, we incorporate an Artificial Potential Field (APF)-based reward structure, enabling the agent to refine its movements, thereby promoting smoother paths and enhanced obstacle avoidance in indoor contexts. Furthermore, we tackle the issue of task distribution among cooperative UAVs through a DRL-trained Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). This GCN represents the interactions between drones and tasks, facilitating dynamic and real-time task allocation that reflects the current environmental conditions and the capabilities of the drones. Such an approach fosters effective coordination and collaboration among multiple drones during search and rescue operations or other exploratory endeavours. Lastly, to ensure precise odometry in environments lacking GNSS, we employ Light Detection And Ranging Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping complemented by a depth camera to mitigate the hallway problem. This integration offers robust localisation and mapping functionalities, thereby enhancing the systems dependability in indoor navigation. The proposed multi-drone framework not only elevates individual navigation capabilities but also optimises coordinated task allocation in complex, obstacle-laden environments. Experimental evaluations conducted in a setup tailored to meet the requirements of the NATO Sapience Autonomous Cooperative Drone Competition demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system, yielding outstanding results and culminating in a first-place finish in the 2024 Sapience competition.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically necessitate extensive exploration of the state space to find optimal policies. However, in safety-critical applications, the risks associated with such exploration can lead to catastrophic consequences. Existing safe exploration methods attempt to mitigate this by imposing constraints, which often result in overly conservative behaviours and inefficient learning. Heavy penalties for early constraint violations can trap agents in local optima, deterring exploration of risky yet high-reward regions of the state space. To address this, we introduce a method that explicitly learns state-conditioned safety representations. By augmenting the state features with these safety representations, our approach naturally encourages safer exploration without being excessively cautious, resulting in more efficient and safer policy learning in safety-critical scenarios. Empirical evaluations across diverse environments show that our method significantly improves task performance while reducing constraint violations during training, underscoring its effectiveness in balancing exploration with safety.

Abstract: High energy consumption remains a key challenge in high-performance computing (HPC) systems, which often feature hundreds or thousands of nodes drawing substantial power even in idle or standby modes. Although powering down unused nodes can improve energy efficiency, choosing the wrong time to do so can degrade quality of service by delaying job execution. Machine learning, in particular reinforcement learning (RL), has shown promise in determining optimal times to switch nodes on or off. In this study, we enhance the performance of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent for HPC power management by integrating curriculum learning (CL), a training approach that introduces tasks with gradually increasing difficulty. Using the Batsim-py simulation framework, we compare the proposed CL-based agent to both a baseline DRL method (without CL) and the conventional fixed-time timeout strategy. Experimental results confirm that an easy-to-hard curriculum outperforms other training orders in terms of reducing wasted energy usage. The best agent achieves a 3.73% energy reduction over the baseline DRL method and a 4.66% improvement compared to the best timeout configuration (shutdown every 15 minutes of idle time). In addition, it reduces average job waiting time by 9.24% and maintains a higher job-filling rate, indicating more effective resource utilization. Sensitivity tests across various switch-on durations, power levels, and cluster sizes further reveal the agent's adaptability to changing system parameters without retraining. These findings demonstrate that curriculum learning can significantly improve DRL-based power management in HPC, balancing energy savings, quality of service, and robustness to diverse configurations.

Abstract: Scenario Description Languages (SDLs) provide structured, interpretable embeddings that represent traffic scenarios encountered by autonomous vehicles (AVs), supporting key tasks such as scenario similarity searches and edge case detection for safety analysis. This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing. This work provides a foundation for scalable scenario-based AV behavior analysis, with potential extensions for integrating multi-agent contexts.

Abstract: Agentic Generative AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Vector Stores (VSs), represents a transformative technology applicable to specialized domains such as legal systems, research, recommender systems, cybersecurity, and global security, including proliferation research. This technology excels at inferring relationships within vast unstructured or semi-structured datasets. The legal domain here comprises complex data characterized by extensive, interrelated, and semi-structured knowledge systems with complex relations. It comprises constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law. Extracting insights and navigating the intricate networks of legal documents and their relations is crucial for effective legal research. Here, we introduce a generative AI system that integrates RAG, VS, and KG, constructed via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to enhance legal information retrieval and AI reasoning and minimize hallucinations. In the legal system, these technologies empower AI agents to identify and analyze complex connections among cases, statutes, and legal precedents, uncovering hidden relationships and predicting legal trends-challenging tasks that are essential for ensuring justice and improving operational efficiency. Our system employs web scraping techniques to systematically collect legal texts, such as statutes, constitutional provisions, and case law, from publicly accessible platforms like Justia. It bridges the gap between traditional keyword-based searches and contextual understanding by leveraging advanced semantic representations, hierarchical relationships, and latent topic discovery. This framework supports legal document clustering, summarization, and cross-referencing, for scalable, interpretable, and accurate retrieval for semi-structured data while advancing computational law and AI.

Abstract: Multi-agent path planning is a critical challenge in robotics, requiring agents to navigate complex environments while avoiding collisions and optimizing travel efficiency. This work addresses the limitations of existing approaches by combining Gaussian belief propagation with path integration and introducing a novel tracking factor to ensure strict adherence to global paths. The proposed method is tested with two different global path-planning approaches: rapidly exploring random trees and a structured planner, which leverages predefined lane structures to improve coordination. A simulation environment was developed to validate the proposed method across diverse scenarios, each posing unique challenges in navigation and communication. Simulation results demonstrate that the tracking factor reduces path deviation by 28% in single-agent and 16% in multi-agent scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness in improving multi-agent coordination, especially when combined with structured global planning.

Abstract: By utilizing more computational resources at test-time, large language models (LLMs) can improve without additional training. One common strategy uses verifiers to evaluate candidate outputs. In this work, we propose a novel scaling dimension for test-time compute: scaling the number of verifiers. We introduce Multi-Agent Verification (MAV) as a test-time compute paradigm that combines multiple verifiers to improve performance. We propose using Aspect Verifiers (AVs), off-the-shelf LLMs prompted to verify different aspects of outputs, as one possible choice for the verifiers in a MAV system. AVs are a convenient building block for MAV since they can be easily combined without additional training. Moreover, we introduce BoN-MAV, a simple multi-agent verification algorithm that combines best-of-n sampling with multiple verifiers. BoN-MAV demonstrates stronger scaling patterns than self-consistency and reward model verification, and we demonstrate both weak-to-strong generalization, where combining weak verifiers improves even stronger LLMs, and self-improvement, where the same base model is used to both generate and verify outputs. Our results establish scaling the number of verifiers as a promising new dimension for improving language model performance at test-time.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Web AI agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex web navigation tasks. However, emerging research shows that these agents exhibit greater vulnerability compared to standalone Large Language Models (LLMs), despite both being built upon the same safety-aligned models. This discrepancy is particularly concerning given the greater flexibility of Web AI Agent compared to standalone LLMs, which may expose them to a wider range of adversarial user inputs. To build a scaffold that addresses these concerns, this study investigates the underlying factors that contribute to the increased vulnerability of Web AI agents. Notably, this disparity stems from the multifaceted differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, as well as the complex signals - nuances that simple evaluation metrics, such as success rate, often fail to capture. To tackle these challenges, we propose a component-level analysis and a more granular, systematic evaluation framework. Through this fine-grained investigation, we identify three critical factors that amplify the vulnerability of Web AI agents; (1) embedding user goals into the system prompt, (2) multi-step action generation, and (3) observational capabilities. Our findings highlights the pressing need to enhance security and robustness in AI agent design and provide actionable insights for targeted defense strategies.

Abstract: Building robotic agents capable of operating across diverse environments and object types remains a significant challenge, often requiring extensive data collection. This is particularly restrictive in robotics, where each data point must be physically executed in the real world. Consequently, there is a critical need for alternative data sources for robotics and frameworks that enable learning from such data. In this work, we present Point Policy, a new method for learning robot policies exclusively from offline human demonstration videos and without any teleoperation data. Point Policy leverages state-of-the-art vision models and policy architectures to translate human hand poses into robot poses while capturing object states through semantically meaningful key points. This approach yields a morphology-agnostic representation that facilitates effective policy learning. Our experiments on 8 real-world tasks demonstrate an overall 75% absolute improvement over prior works when evaluated in identical settings as training. Further, Point Policy exhibits a 74% gain across tasks for novel object instances and is robust to significant background clutter. Videos of the robot are best viewed at https://point-policy.github.io/.

Abstract: Accurate calibration of stochastic agent-based models (ABMs) in epidemiology is crucial to make them useful in public health policy decisions and interventions. Traditional calibration methods, e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), that yield a probability density function for the parameters being calibrated, are often computationally expensive. When applied to ABMs which are highly parametrized, the calibration process becomes computationally infeasible. This paper investigates the utility of Stein Variational Inference (SVI) as an alternative calibration technique for stochastic epidemiological ABMs approximated by Gaussian process (GP) surrogates. SVI leverages gradient information to iteratively update a set of particles in the space of parameters being calibrated, offering potential advantages in scalability and efficiency for high-dimensional ABMs. The ensemble of particles yields a joint probability density function for the parameters and serves as the calibration. We compare the performance of SVI and MCMC in calibrating CityCOVID, a stochastic epidemiological ABM, focusing on predictive accuracy and calibration effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that SVI maintains predictive accuracy and calibration effectiveness comparable to MCMC, making it a viable alternative for complex epidemiological models. We also present the practical challenges of using a gradient-based calibration such as SVI which include careful tuning of hyperparameters and monitoring of the particle dynamics.

本文研究了向等待分配固定时间的稀缺商品的代理人提供信息的影响。当代理人的效用是基于等待时间的准线性时，他们会像在降序拍卖中竞标一样选择进入时间。信息设计师可以通过发布有关队列长度的更新来影响他们的行为。文中指出，“突然坏消息”——即代理人得知队列比之前认为的更长的情况，可能会导致匹配效率降低，引发大量代理人同时尝试加入队列。结果表明，对于具有递增（递减）风险率的价值分布，相比不发布任何信息，发布带有突然坏消息的信息政策会增加（减少）总的剩余价值。当代理人面临加入队列的成本并且价值分布具有递减的风险率时，信息设计师通过仅在队列已满时发布公告，可以最大化总福利。 <div>

Abstract: We study the effect of providing information to agents who queue before a scarce good is distributed at a fixed time. When agents have quasi-linear utility in time spent waiting, they choose entry times as they would bids in a descending auction. An information designer can influence their behavior by providing updates about the length of the queue. Many natural information policies release "sudden bad news," which occurs when agents learn that the queue is longer than previously believed. We show that sudden bad news can cause assortative inefficiency by prompting a mass of agents to simultaneously attempt to join the queue. As a result, if the value distribution has an increasing (decreasing) hazard rate, information policies that release sudden bad news increase (decrease) total surplus, relative to releasing no information. When agents face entry costs to join the queue and the value distribution has a decreasing hazard rate, an information designer maximizes total surplus by announcing only when the queue is full.

Abstract: When allocating indivisible items to agents, it is known that the only strategyproof mechanisms that satisfy a set of rather mild conditions are constrained serial dictatorships: given a fixed order over agents, at each step the designated agent chooses a given number of items (depending on her position in the sequence). Agents who come earlier in the sequence have a larger choice of items; however, this advantage can be compensated by a higher number of items received by those who come later. How to balance priority in the sequence and number of items received is a nontrivial question. We use a previous model, parameterized by a mapping from ranks to scores, a social welfare functional, and a distribution over preference profiles. For several meaningful choices of parameters, we show that the optimal sequence can be computed exactly in polynomial time or approximated using sampling. Our results hold for several probabilistic models on preference profiles, with an emphasis on the Plackett-Luce model. We conclude with experimental results showing how the optimal sequence is impacted by various parameters.

Abstract: Autonomous robots for endovascular interventions hold significant potential to enhance procedural safety and reliability by navigating guidewires with precision, minimizing human error, and reducing surgical time. However, existing methods of guidewire navigation rely on manual demonstration data and have a suboptimal success rate. In this work, we propose a knowledge-driven visual guidance (KVG) method that leverages available visual information from interventional imaging to facilitate guidewire navigation. Our approach integrates image segmentation and detection techniques to extract surgical knowledge, including vascular maps and guidewire positions. We introduce BDA-star, a novel path planning algorithm with boundary distance constraints, to optimize trajectory planning for guidewire navigation. To validate the method, we developed the KVD-Reinforcement Learning environment, where observations consist of real-time guidewire feeding images highlighting the guidewire tip position and the planned path. We proposed a reward function based on the distances from both the guidewire tip to the planned path and the target to evaluate the agent's actions.Additionally, to address stability issues and slow convergence rates associated with direct learning from raw pixels, we incorporated a pre-trained convolutional neural network into the policy network for feature extraction. Experiments conducted on the aortic simulation autonomous guidewire navigation platform demonstrated that the proposed method, targeting the left subclavian artery, left carotid artery and the brachiocephalic artery, achieved a 100\% guidewire navigation success rate, along with reduced movement and retraction distances and trajectories tend to the center of the vessels.

Abstract: Point cloud videos can faithfully capture real-world spatial geometries and temporal dynamics, which are essential for enabling intelligent agents to understand the dynamically changing world. However, designing an effective 4D backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Also, recent transformer-based 4D backbones commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly for long video sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel point cloud video understanding backbone purely based on the State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, we first disentangle space and time in 4D video sequences and then establish the spatio-temporal correlation with our designed Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is developed to encode locally similar geometric structures within a certain temporal stride. Subsequently, locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which integrates long-term point features across the entire video with linear complexity. Our proposed Mamba4d achieves competitive performance on the MSR-Action3D action recognition (+10.4% accuracy), HOI4D action segmentation (+0.7 F1 Score), and Synthia4D semantic segmentation (+0.19 mIoU) datasets. Especially, for long video sequences, our method has a significant efficiency improvement with 87.5% GPU memory reduction and 5.36 times speed-up. Codes will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/Mamba4D.

Abstract: Understanding multi-agent movement is critical across various fields. The conventional approaches typically focus on separate tasks such as trajectory prediction, imputation, or spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique formulation and constraint of each task, most existing methods are tailored for only one, limiting the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, which is a common requirement in real-world scenarios. Another limitation is that widely used public datasets mainly focus on pedestrian movements with casual, loosely connected patterns, where interactions between individuals are not always present, especially at a long distance, making them less representative of more structured environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios in the domain of sports games. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module, embedded within a Transformer encoder, for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent State Space Models (SSMs), known as the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba (BTM) to better capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to thoroughly scan trajectories while preserving temporal missing relationships. Furthermore, we curate and benchmark three practical sports datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. We hope that our work can advance the understanding of human movement in real-world applications, particularly in sports. Our datasets, code, and model weights are available here https://github.com/colorfulfuture/UniTraj-pytorch.

Abstract: Current multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) methods often assume a single source and type of forgery for each sample, which is insufficient for real-world scenarios where multiple forgery sources coexist. The lack of a benchmark for mixed-source misinformation has hindered progress in this field. To address this, we introduce MMFakeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for mixed-source MMD. MMFakeBench includes 3 critical sources: textual veracity distortion, visual veracity distortion, and cross-modal consistency distortion, along with 12 sub-categories of misinformation forgery types. We further conduct an extensive evaluation of 6 prevalent detection methods and 15 Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on MMFakeBench under a zero-shot setting. The results indicate that current methods struggle under this challenging and realistic mixed-source MMD setting. Additionally, we propose MMD-Agent, a novel approach to integrate the reasoning, action, and tool-use capabilities of LVLM agents, significantly enhancing accuracy and generalization. We believe this study will catalyze future research into more realistic mixed-source multimodal misinformation and provide a fair evaluation of misinformation detection methods.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks often utilize a centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework. QMIX is a successful CTDE method that learns a credit assignment function to derive local value functions from a global value function, defining a deterministic local policy. However, QMIX is hindered by its poor exploration strategy. While maximum entropy reinforcement learning (RL) promotes better exploration through stochastic policies, QMIX's process of credit assignment conflicts with the maximum entropy objective and the decentralized execution requirement, making it unsuitable for maximum entropy RL. In this paper, we propose an enhancement to QMIX by incorporating an additional local Q-value learning method within the maximum entropy RL framework. Our approach constrains the local Q-value estimates to maintain the correct ordering of all actions. Due to the monotonicity of the QMIX value function, these updates ensure that locally optimal actions align with globally optimal actions. We theoretically prove the monotonic improvement and convergence of our method to an optimal solution. Experimentally, we validate our algorithm in matrix games, Multi-Agent Particle Environment and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in SMAC-v2.

Abstract: Data analytics is essential for extracting valuable insights from data that can assist organizations in making effective decisions. We introduce InsightBench, a benchmark dataset with three key features. First, it consists of 100 datasets representing diverse business use cases such as finance and incident management, each accompanied by a carefully curated set of insights planted in the datasets. Second, unlike existing benchmarks focusing on answering single queries, InsightBench evaluates agents based on their ability to perform end-to-end data analytics, including formulating questions, interpreting answers, and generating a summary of insights and actionable steps. Third, we conducted comprehensive quality assurance to ensure that each dataset in the benchmark had clear goals and included relevant and meaningful questions and analysis. Furthermore, we implement a two-way evaluation mechanism using LLaMA-3 as an effective, open-source evaluator to assess agents' ability to extract insights. We also propose AgentPoirot, our baseline data analysis agent capable of performing end-to-end data analytics. Our evaluation on InsightBench shows that AgentPoirot outperforms existing approaches (such as Pandas Agent) that focus on resolving single queries. We also compare the performance of open- and closed-source LLMs and various evaluation strategies. Overall, this benchmark serves as a testbed to motivate further development in comprehensive automated data analytics and can be accessed here: https://github.com/ServiceNow/insight-bench.

本文研究了21世纪抗议活动的普遍性以及推动社会变革的过程。为了解析这一复杂动态过程中的关键条件，作者提出了一种新的理论驱动并经实证支持的agent-based模型，用于模拟集体行动。通过模拟约10,000次迭代的虚拟社会，研究表明，当权威机构对运动诉求有所响应，且抗议者能够认知或社交上质疑运动失败时，温和的常规运动将会持续存在。然而，当权威机构反复、明显地未能回应运动需求时，人群会失去参与热情但转而激进化（潜伏的激进主义），这可能是引发突然、革命性变化前夕的社会状态。该研究结果强调了模拟方法在揭示新兴、尚未充分理论化的现象方面的潜力。 <div>

Abstract: Protest is ubiquitous in the 21st Century and the people who participate in such movements do so because they seek to bring about social change. However, social change takes time and involves repeated interactions between individual protesters, social movements and the authorities to whom they appeal for change. These complexities of time and scale have frustrated efforts to isolate the conditions that foster an enduring movement, on the one hand, and the adoption of more radical (unconventional, unacceptable) tactics on the other. Here, we present a novel, theoretically informed and empirically evidenced, agent-based model of collective action that provides a unified framework to address these dual challenges. We model ~10,000 iterations within a simulated society and show that where an authority is responsive, and protesters can (cognitively and/or socially) contest the failure of their movement, a moderate conventional movement prevails. Conversely, where an authority repeatedly and incontrovertibly fails the movement, the population disengages but becomes radicalised (latent radicalism). This latter finding, whereby the whole population is disengaged but prepared to use radical methods to bring about social change, likely reflects the febrile pre-cursor state to sudden, revolutionary change. Results highlight the potential for simulations to reveal emergent, as-yet under-theorized, phenomena.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a rapid growth of agentic systems capable of handling a wide range of complex tasks. However, current research largely relies on manual, task-specific design, limiting their adaptability to novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new research problem: Modularized LLM Agent Search (MoLAS). We propose a modular design space that abstracts existing LLM agent designs into four fundamental modules with uniform IO interface: Planning, Reasoning, Tool Use, and Memory. Building on this design space, we present a novel LLM agent search framework called AgentSquare, which introduces two core mechanisms, i.e., module evolution and recombination, to efficiently search for optimized LLM agents. To further accelerate the process, we design a performance predictor that uses in-context surrogate models to skip unpromising agent designs. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks, covering the diverse scenarios of web, embodied, tool use and game applications, show that AgentSquare substantially outperforms hand-crafted agents, achieving an average performance gain of 17.2% against best-known human designs. Moreover, AgentSquare can generate interpretable design insights, enabling a deeper understanding of agentic architecture and its impact on task performance. We believe that the modular design space and AgentSquare search framework offer a platform for fully exploiting the potential of prior successful designs and consolidating the collective efforts of research community.

Abstract: We propose a new variant of the strategic classification problem: a principal reveals a classifier, and $n$ agents report their (possibly manipulated) features to be classified. Motivated by real-world applications, our model crucially allows the manipulation of one agent to affect another; that is, it explicitly captures inter-agent externalities. The principal-agent interactions are formally modeled as a Stackelberg game, with the resulting agent manipulation dynamics captured as a simultaneous game. We show that under certain assumptions, the pure Nash Equilibrium of this agent manipulation game is unique and can be efficiently computed. Leveraging this result, PAC learning guarantees are established for the learner: informally, we show that it is possible to learn classifiers that minimize loss on the distribution, even when a random number of agents are manipulating their way to a pure Nash Equilibrium. We also comment on the optimization of such classifiers through gradient-based approaches. This work sets the theoretical foundations for a more realistic analysis of classifiers that are robust against multiple strategic actors interacting in a common environment.

Abstract: Predicting the future motion of surrounding agents is essential for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to operate safely in dynamic, human-robot-mixed environments. However, the scarcity of large-scale driving datasets has hindered the development of robust and generalizable motion prediction models, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions and road geometries. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained significant attention in the motion prediction community for learning rich and transferable scene representations. Nonetheless, existing pre-training methods for motion prediction have largely focused on specific model architectures and single dataset, limiting their scalability and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose SmartPretrain, a general and scalable SSL framework for motion prediction that is both model-agnostic and dataset-agnostic. Our approach integrates contrastive and reconstructive SSL, leveraging the strengths of both generative and discriminative paradigms to effectively represent spatiotemporal evolution and interactions without imposing architectural constraints. Additionally, SmartPretrain employs a dataset-agnostic scenario sampling strategy that integrates multiple datasets, enhancing data volume, diversity, and robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that SmartPretrain consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art prediction models across datasets, data splits and main metrics. For instance, SmartPretrain significantly reduces the MissRate of Forecast-MAE by 10.6%. These results highlight SmartPretrain's effectiveness as a unified, scalable solution for motion prediction, breaking free from the limitations of the small-data regime.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key approach for training agents in complex and uncertain environments. Incorporating statistical inference in RL algorithms is essential for understanding and managing uncertainty in model performance. This paper introduces a generalized framework for time-varying batch-averaged Q-learning, termed sample-averaged Q-learning (SA-QL), which extends traditional single-sample Q-learning by aggregating samples of rewards and next states to better account for data variability and uncertainty. We leverage the functional central limit theorem (FCLT) to establish a novel framework that provides insights into the asymptotic normality of the sample-averaged algorithm under mild conditions. Additionally, we develop a random scaling method for interval estimation, enabling the construction of confidence intervals without requiring extra hyperparameters. Extensive numerical experiments across classic stochastic OpenAI Gym environments, including windy gridworld and slippery frozenlake, demonstrate how different batch scheduling strategies affect learning efficiency, coverage rates, and confidence interval widths. This work establishes a unified theoretical foundation for sample-averaged Q-learning, providing insights into effective batch scheduling and statistical inference for RL algorithms.

Abstract: Inventory control in modern supply chains has attracted significant attention due to the increasing number of disruptive shocks and the challenges posed by complex dynamics, uncertainties, and limited collaboration. Traditional methods, which often rely on static parameters, struggle to adapt to changing environments. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for state representation to address these limitations.
  Our approach redefines the action space by parameterizing heuristic inventory control policies, making it adaptive as the parameters dynamically adjust based on system conditions. By leveraging the inherent graph structure of supply chains, our framework enables agents to learn the system's topology, and we employ a centralized learning, decentralized execution scheme that allows agents to learn collaboratively while overcoming information-sharing constraints. Additionally, we incorporate global mean pooling and regularization techniques to enhance performance.
  We test the capabilities of our proposed approach on four different supply chain configurations and conduct a sensitivity analysis. This work paves the way for utilizing MARL-GNN frameworks to improve inventory management in complex, decentralized supply chain environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce answers with a single chain-of-thought, which restricts their ability to explore reasoning paths or self-correct flawed outputs in complex tasks. In this paper, we introduce MALT (Multi-Agent LLM Training), a novel post-training strategy that divides the reasoning process into generation, verification, and refinement steps using a sequential pipeline of heterogeneous agents. During data generation, each agent is repeatedly sampled to form a multi-agent search tree, where final outputs are graded against ground-truth data. We then apply value iteration to propagate reward signals back to each role-conditioned model, automatically producing multi-agent post-training data without human or teacher-model supervision. Our off-policy approach allows each agent to specialize by learning from correct and incorrect trajectories, ultimately improving the end-to-end reasoning chain. On MATH, GSM8K, and CSQA, MALT surpasses the same baseline LLM with a relative improvement of 15.66%, 7.42%, and 9.40% respectively, making it an important advance towards multi-agent cooperative training.

Abstract: As a potential application of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, multi-agent collaborative perception has achieved significant success in 3D object detection. While these methods have demonstrated impressive results on standard benchmarks, the robustness of such approaches in the face of complex real-world environments requires additional verification. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of collaborative perception methods in the presence of natural corruptions typical of real-world environments. Furthermore, we propose DSRC, a robustness-enhanced collaborative perception method aiming to learn Density-insensitive and Semantic-aware collaborative Representation against Corruptions. DSRC consists of two key designs: i) a semantic-guided sparse-to-dense distillation framework, which constructs multi-view dense objects painted by ground truth bounding boxes to effectively learn density-insensitive and semantic-aware collaborative representation; ii) a feature-to-point cloud reconstruction approach to better fuse critical collaborative representation across agents. To thoroughly evaluate DSRC, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world and simulated datasets. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms SOTA collaborative perception methods in both clean and corrupted conditions. Code is available at https://github.com/Terry9a/DSRC.

总结:
本文提出了一个针对大规模语言模型驱动的社交代理人的新方法——段落级直接偏好优化(SDPO)，用于改进多轮社会对话处理能力。现有的直接偏好优化方法主要关注单一回合，而SDPO则通过动态选择交互中的关键片段来优化多轮代理行为，降低了训练噪声并具有坚实的理论基础。相较于现有DPO方法和如GPT-4o等专有LLM，经SDPO调整后的代理人在SOTOPIA基准测试中表现出色，显示出提升LLM社交智能的巨大潜力。研究代码和数据已在https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/SDPO上公开发布。 <div>

Abstract: Social agents powered by large language models (LLMs) can simulate human social behaviors but fall short in handling complex social dialogues. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has proven effective in aligning LLM behavior with human preferences across various agent tasks. However, standard DPO focuses solely on individual turns, which limits its effectiveness in multi-turn social interactions. Several DPO-based multi-turn alignment methods with session-level data have shown potential in addressing this problem.While these methods consider multiple turns across entire sessions, they are often overly coarse-grained, introducing training noise, and lack robust theoretical support. To resolve these limitations, we propose Segment-Level Direct Preference Optimization (SDPO), which dynamically select key segments within interactions to optimize multi-turn agent behavior. SDPO minimizes training noise and is grounded in a rigorous theoretical framework. Evaluations on the SOTOPIA benchmark demonstrate that SDPO-tuned agents consistently outperform both existing DPO-based methods and proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o, underscoring SDPO's potential to advance the social intelligence of LLM-based agents. We release our code and data at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/SDPO.

总结:
本文分析了电力系统中采用峰谷电价策略（即巧合峰值削峰）如何影响消费者的用电行为以及整体系统的效率。通过运用游戏理论，研究发现该削峰游戏可能呈现出凹形、带有间断点的准凹形或非凹形并带有间断点的状态，这取决于消费者的负荷转移能力。文章在一个双主体、两时期的框架下推导出了各场景下的闭合形式纳什均衡解，并将分析扩展到多主体设置。证明了这些均衡点的稳定性，并提出了一种计算所有游戏配置下的均衡结果的算法。进一步地，研究表明去中心化的游戏模型虽然能达到与集中式方法相当的削峰效果，但会以增加无政府状态为代价。在具有准凹性和非凹性条件的场景中，随着消费者灵活性增大和边际转移成本差异加大，无政府状态也会随之增长；此外还探讨了主体数量对系统效率的影响。最后，通过数值模拟验证了理论成果。 <div>

Abstract: Power system operators and electric utility companies often charge consumers a peak demand charge when the aggregate system demand reaches its maximum, a practice known as coincident peak shaving. These charges incentivize consumers to reduce usage during critical periods, alleviating stress on electricity transmission and distribution systems, while also helping to recover the grid investment costs. In this paper, we analyze the problem through the lens of game theory, developing a model that captures how strategic consumer behavior influences overall system efficiency. Our results reveal that the coincident peak shaving game can be concave, quasiconcave with discontinuities, or non-concave with discontinuities, depending on the extent of consumers' demand-shifting capabilities. In a two-agent, two-period framework, we derive closed-form Nash equilibrium solutions for each scenario and extend our analysis to multi-agent settings. We prove the stability of these equilibrium points and propose an algorithm to compute equilibrium outcomes across all game configurations. Furthermore, we show that while the decentralized game model achieves peak-shaving performance comparable to a centralized approach, it does so at the cost of increased anarchy. In scenarios characterized by quasi-concave and non-concave conditions, our analytical results demonstrate that anarchy grows with greater consumer flexibility and disparities in marginal shifting costs, and we explore how the number of agents affects system efficiency. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Simulation agents are essential for designing and testing systems that interact with humans, such as autonomous vehicles (AVs). These agents serve various purposes, from benchmarking AV performance to stress-testing system limits, but all applications share one key requirement: reliability. To enable systematic experimentation, a simulation agent must behave as intended. It should minimize actions that may lead to undesired outcomes, such as collisions, which can distort the signal-to-noise ratio in analyses. As a foundation for reliable sim agents, we propose scaling self-play to thousands of scenarios on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset under semi-realistic limits on human perception and control. Training from scratch on a single GPU, our agents nearly solve the full training set within a day. They generalize effectively to unseen test scenes, achieving a 99.8% goal completion rate with less than 0.8% combined collision and off-road incidents across 10,000 held-out scenarios. Beyond in-distribution generalization, our agents show partial robustness to out-of-distribution scenes and can be fine-tuned in minutes to reach near-perfect performance in those cases. We open-source the pre-trained agents and integrate them with a batched multi-agent simulator. Demonstrations of agent behaviors can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/reliable-sim-agents.

<div> 关键词: conformal isometry hypothesis, grid cell, neural space, distance preservation, hexagonal pattern

总结:
本文探讨了共形等距假设作为解释网格细胞响应图中六边形周期模式的可能性。文章提出，网格细胞活动形成一个高维向量，编码了Agent在二维物理空间的位置。当Agent移动时，这个向量在神经空间中的二维流形上旋转，由递归神经网络驱动。共形等距假设认为，该神经流形是一个将二维物理空间共形等距嵌入的结果，其中局部物理距离在嵌入过程中被保留在一个缩放因子（或度量单位）之内。这种保持距离的定位嵌入对于导航中的路径规划至关重要，特别是在规划局部直线路径段时。通过数值实验，作者展示了这一假设会导致学习到的最大程度保持距离的定位嵌入产生六边形网格放电模式，并且对模型的选择不敏感。此外，文中还提供了理论解释，阐明为什么通过最小化损失函数可以出现六边形周期模式，因为六边形平面对角线是最具保距性的。 <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates the conformal isometry hypothesis as a potential explanation for the hexagonal periodic patterns in grid cell response maps. We posit that grid cell activities form a high-dimensional vector in neural space, encoding the agent's position in 2D physical space. As the agent moves, this vector rotates within a 2D manifold in the neural space, driven by a recurrent neural network. The conformal hypothesis proposes that this neural manifold is a conformal isometric embedding of 2D physical space, where local physical distance is preserved by the embedding up to a scaling factor (or unit of metric). Such distance-preserving position embedding is indispensable for path planning in navigation, especially planning local straight path segments. We conduct numerical experiments to show that this hypothesis leads to the hexagonal grid firing patterns by learning maximally distance-preserving position embedding, agnostic to the choice of the recurrent neural network. Furthermore, we present a theoretical explanation of why hexagon periodic patterns emerge by minimizing our loss function by showing that hexagon flat torus is maximally distance preserving.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for automated code generation and debugging, designed to improve accuracy, efficiency, and scalability in software development. The proposed system integrates three core components LangGraph, GLM4 Flash, and ChromaDB within a four step iterative workflow to deliver robust performance and seamless functionality.
  LangGraph serves as a graph-based library for orchestrating tasks, providing precise control and execution while maintaining a unified state object for dynamic updates and consistency. It supports multi-agent, hierarchical, and sequential processes, making it highly adaptable to complex software engineering workflows. GLM4 Flash, a large language model, leverages its advanced capabilities in natural language understanding, contextual reasoning, and multilingual support to generate accurate code snippets based on user prompts. ChromaDB acts as a vector database for semantic search and contextual memory storage, enabling the identification of patterns and the generation of context-aware bug fixes based on historical data.
  The system operates through a structured four-step process: (1) Code Generation, which translates natural language descriptions into executable code; (2) Code Execution, which validates the code by identifying runtime errors and inconsistencies; (3) Code Repair, which iteratively refines buggy code using ChromaDB's memory capabilities and LangGraph's state tracking; and (4) Code Update, which ensures the code meets functional and performance requirements through iterative modifications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like responses but often struggle with interactive tasks that require access to real-time information. This limitation poses challenges in finance, where models must access up-to-date information, such as recent news or price movements, to support decision-making. To address this, we introduce Financial Agent, a knowledge-grounding approach for LLMs to handle financial queries using real-time text and tabular data. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a Financial Context Dataset of over 50,000 financial queries paired with the required context. Second, we train FinBloom 7B, a custom 7 billion parameter LLM, on 14 million financial news articles from Reuters and Deutsche Presse-Agentur, alongside 12 million Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings. Third, we fine-tune FinBloom 7B using the Financial Context Dataset to serve as a Financial Agent. This agent generates relevant financial context, enabling efficient real-time data retrieval to answer user queries. By reducing latency and eliminating the need for users to manually provide accurate data, our approach significantly enhances the capability of LLMs to handle dynamic financial tasks. Our proposed approach makes real-time financial decisions, algorithmic trading and other related tasks streamlined, and is valuable in contexts with high-velocity data flows.

Abstract: Early accident anticipation from dashcam videos is a highly desirable yet challenging task for improving the safety of intelligent vehicles. Existing advanced accident anticipation approaches commonly model the interaction among traffic agents (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.) in the coarse 2D image space, which may not adequately capture their true positions and interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a physical depth-aware learning framework that incorporates the monocular depth features generated by a large model named Depth-Anything to introduce more fine-grained spatial 3D information. Furthermore, the proposed framework also integrates visual interaction features and visual dynamic features from traffic scenes to provide a more comprehensive perception towards the scenes. Based on these multi-dimensional visual features, the framework captures early indicators of accidents through the analysis of interaction relationships between objects in sequential frames. Additionally, the proposed framework introduces a reconstruction adjacency matrix for key traffic participants that are occluded, mitigating the impact of occluded objects on graph learning and maintaining the spatio-temporal continuity. Experimental results on public datasets show that the proposed framework attains state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the effectiveness of incorporating visual depth features and the superiority of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Conversational agents are increasingly woven into individuals' personal lives, yet users often underestimate the privacy risks involved. The moment users share information with these agents (e.g., LLMs), their private information becomes vulnerable to exposure. In this paper, we characterize the notion of contextual privacy for user interactions with LLMs. It aims to minimize privacy risks by ensuring that users (sender) disclose only information that is both relevant and necessary for achieving their intended goals when interacting with LLMs (untrusted receivers). Through a formative design user study, we observe how even "privacy-conscious" users inadvertently reveal sensitive information through indirect disclosures. Based on insights from this study, we propose a locally-deployable framework that operates between users and LLMs, and identifies and reformulates out-of-context information in user prompts. Our evaluation using examples from ShareGPT shows that lightweight models can effectively implement this framework, achieving strong gains in contextual privacy while preserving the user's intended interaction goals through different approaches to classify information relevant to the intended goals.

Abstract: Multi-teacher Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers diverse knowledge from a teacher pool to a student network. The core problem of multi-teacher KD is how to balance distillation strengths among various teachers. Most existing methods often develop weighting strategies from an individual perspective of teacher performance or teacher-student gaps, lacking comprehensive information for guidance. This paper proposes Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation with Reinforcement Learning (MTKD-RL) to optimize multi-teacher weights. In this framework, we construct both teacher performance and teacher-student gaps as state information to an agent. The agent outputs the teacher weight and can be updated by the return reward from the student. MTKD-RL reinforces the interaction between the student and teacher using an agent in an RL-based decision mechanism, achieving better matching capability with more meaningful weights. Experimental results on visual recognition tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, demonstrate that MTKD-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the existing multi-teacher KD works.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the blockchain ecosystem and the increasing value locked in smart contracts necessitate robust security measures. While languages like Solidity and Move aim to improve smart contract security, vulnerabilities persist. This paper presents Smartify, a novel multi-agent framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically detect and repair vulnerabilities in Solidity and Move smart contracts. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on vast pre-training datasets, Smartify employs a team of specialized agents working on different specially fine-tuned LLMs to analyze code based on underlying programming concepts and language-specific security principles. We evaluated Smartify on a dataset for Solidity and a curated dataset for Move, demonstrating its effectiveness in fixing a wide range of vulnerabilities. Our results show that Smartify (Gemma2+codegemma) achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing LLMs and enhancing general-purpose models' capabilities, such as Llama 3.1. Notably, Smartify can incorporate language-specific knowledge, such as the nuances of Move, without requiring massive language-specific pre-training datasets. This work offers a detailed analysis of various LLMs' performance on smart contract repair, highlighting the strengths of our multi-agent approach and providing a blueprint for developing more secure and reliable decentralized applications in the growing blockchain landscape. We also provide a detailed recipe for extending this to other similar use cases.

Abstract: Recent advancements in software engineering (SWE) agents have largely followed a $\textit{tool-based paradigm}$, where agents interact with hand-engineered tool APIs to perform specific tasks. While effective for specialized tasks, these methods fundamentally lack generalization, as they require predefined tools for each task and do not scale across programming languages and domains. We introduce $\texttt{Programming with Pixels}$ (PwP), an agent environment that unifies software development tasks by enabling $\textit{computer-use agents}$-agents that operate directly within an IDE through visual perception, typing, and clicking, rather than relying on predefined tool APIs. To systematically evaluate these agents, we propose $\texttt{PwP-Bench}$, a benchmark that unifies existing SWE benchmarks spanning tasks across multiple programming languages, modalities, and domains under a task-agnostic state and action space. Our experiments demonstrate that general-purpose computer-use agents can approach or even surpass specialized tool-based agents on a variety of SWE tasks without the need for hand-engineered tools. However, our analysis shows that current models suffer from limited visual grounding and fail to exploit many IDE tools that could simplify their tasks. When agents can directly access IDE tools, without visual interaction, they show significant performance improvements, highlighting the untapped potential of leveraging built-in IDE capabilities. Our results establish PwP as a scalable testbed for building and evaluating the next wave of software engineering agents. We release code and data at https://programmingwithpixels.com

Abstract: Strategic aggregation of electric vehicle batteries as energy reservoirs can optimize power grid demand, benefiting smart and connected communities, especially large office buildings that offer workplace charging. This involves optimizing charging and discharging to reduce peak energy costs and net peak demand, monitored over extended periods (e.g., a month), which involves making sequential decisions under uncertainty and delayed and sparse rewards, a continuous action space, and the complexity of ensuring generalization across diverse conditions. Existing algorithmic approaches, e.g., heuristic-based strategies, fall short in addressing real-time decision-making under dynamic conditions, and traditional reinforcement learning (RL) models struggle with large state-action spaces, multi-agent settings, and the need for long-term reward optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel RL framework that combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient approach (DDPG) with action masking and efficient MILP-driven policy guidance. Our approach balances the exploration of continuous action spaces to meet user charging demands. Using real-world data from a major electric vehicle manufacturer, we show that our approach comprehensively outperforms many well-established baselines and several scalable heuristic approaches, achieving significant cost savings while meeting all charging requirements. Our results show that the proposed approach is one of the first scalable and general approaches to solving the V2B energy management challenge.

<div> 关键词: 计算机视觉、机器学习、大语言模型、迭代细化、IMPROVE

总结:
这篇论文介绍了一个用于优化计算机视觉模型设计的新策略——迭代细化（Iterative Refinement），该策略受到人类机器学习专家逐步优化模型方式的启发。传统上，开发高性能的计算机视觉模型需要机器学习和领域专业知识，而大型语言模型（LLM）代理已成为自动化这一流程的潜在解决方案。然而，现有的大多数方法尝试一次性优化整个流程，导致改进难以归因于特定变化，从而影响稳定性和收敛速度。为解决这个问题，文章提出了名为IMPROVE的端到端LLM代理框架，它运用迭代细化策略，逐个更新基于真实训练反馈的组件，提高了稳定性、可解释性以及整体模型性能。通过在不同规模和领域的数据集上的广泛评估，包括标准基准数据集和Kaggle竞赛数据集，研究显示迭代细化使IMPROVE能够持续超越现有基于LLM的一步式方法并实现更好的性能。因此，迭代细化被确立为一种有效的LLM驱动的机器学习自动化新策略，并使得IMPROVE成为一个无需具备机器学习专业知识即可构建高质量计算机视觉模型的可行方案。 <div>

Abstract: Computer vision is a critical component in a wide range of real-world applications, including plant monitoring in agriculture and handwriting classification in digital systems. However, developing high-performance computer vision models traditionally demands both machine learning (ML) expertise and domain-specific knowledge, making the process costly, labor-intensive, and inaccessible to many. Large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as a promising solution to automate this workflow, but most existing methods share a common limitation: they attempt to optimize entire pipelines in a single step before evaluation, making it difficult to attribute improvements to specific changes. This lack of granularity leads to unstable optimization and slower convergence, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we introduce Iterative Refinement, a novel strategy for LLM-driven ML pipeline design inspired by how human ML experts iteratively refine models, focusing on one component at a time rather than making sweeping changes all at once. By systematically updating individual components based on real training feedback, Iterative Refinement improves stability, interpretability, and overall model performance. We implement this strategy in IMPROVE, an end-to-end LLM agent framework for automating and optimizing object classification pipelines. Through extensive evaluations across datasets of varying sizes and domains, including standard benchmarks and Kaggle competition datasets, we demonstrate that Iterative Refinement enables IMPROVE to consistently achieve better performance over existing zero-shot LLM-based approaches. These findings establish Iterative Refinement as an effective new strategy for LLM-driven ML automation and position IMPROVE as an accessible solution for building high-quality computer vision models without requiring ML expertise.

该文关注静态环境下应用于机器学习模型的公平性约束可能导致随着时间推移对某些人口群体产生不利影响的问题。为解决这一问题，研究开始转向创建能够随时间保持公平性的解决方案。文章指出，在现实世界系统中，多智能体之间的相互作用往往会影响结果，因此将这些实体建模为代理能更灵活地分析其干预措施及对系统动态的影响。然而，当前在多智能体系统方面的研究缺乏利用有限的真实世界数据进行分析的逼真环境。为此，文章提出了Multi-Agent Fair Environment (MAFE)的概念，并构建和分析了三个模拟不同社会系统的MAFE实例。实验结果验证了MAFE作为开发多智能体公平算法测试平台的有效性。 <div>

Abstract: Fairness constraints applied to machine learning (ML) models in static contexts have been shown to potentially produce adverse outcomes among demographic groups over time. To address this issue, emerging research focuses on creating fair solutions that persist over time. While many approaches treat this as a single-agent decision-making problem, real-world systems often consist of multiple interacting entities that influence outcomes. Explicitly modeling these entities as agents enables more flexible analysis of their interventions and the effects they have on a system's underlying dynamics. A significant challenge in conducting research on multi-agent systems is the lack of realistic environments that leverage the limited real-world data available for analysis. To address this gap, we introduce the concept of a Multi-Agent Fair Environment (MAFE) and present and analyze three MAFEs that model distinct social systems. Experimental results demonstrate the utility of our MAFEs as testbeds for developing multi-agent fair algorithms.

Abstract: As machine learning technologies advance rapidly across various domains, concerns over data privacy and model security have grown significantly. These challenges are particularly pronounced when models are trained and deployed on cloud platforms or third-party servers due to the computational resource limitations of users' end devices. In response, zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology has emerged as a promising solution, enabling effective validation of model performance and authenticity in both training and inference processes without disclosing sensitive data. Thus, ZKP ensures the verifiability and security of machine learning models, making it a valuable tool for privacy-preserving AI. Although some research has explored the verifiable machine learning solutions that exploit ZKP, a comprehensive survey and summary of these efforts remain absent. This survey paper aims to bridge this gap by reviewing and analyzing all the existing Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML) research from June 2017 to December 2024. We begin by introducing the concept of ZKML and outlining its ZKP algorithmic setups under three key categories: verifiable training, verifiable inference, and verifiable testing. Next, we provide a comprehensive categorization of existing ZKML research within these categories and analyze the works in detail. Furthermore, we explore the implementation challenges faced in this field and discuss the improvement works to address these obstacles. Additionally, we highlight several commercial applications of ZKML technology. Finally, we propose promising directions for future advancements in this domain.

Abstract: Graph-theoretic problems arise in real-world applications like logistics, communication networks, and traffic optimization. These problems are often complex, noisy, and irregular, posing challenges for traditional algorithms. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential solutions but face challenges, including limited accuracy and input length constraints. To address these challenges, we propose MA-GTS (Multi-Agent Graph Theory Solver), a multi-agent framework that decomposes these complex problems through agent collaboration. MA-GTS maps the implicitly expressed text-based graph data into clear, structured graph representations and dynamically selects the most suitable algorithm based on problem constraints and graph structure scale. This approach ensures that the solution process remains efficient and the resulting reasoning path is interpretable. We validate MA-GTS using the G-REAL dataset, a real-world-inspired graph theory dataset we created. Experimental results show that MA-GTS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and scalability, with strong results across multiple benchmarks (G-REAL 94.2%, GraCoRe 96.9%, NLGraph 98.4%).MA-GTS is open-sourced at https://github.com/ZIKEYUAN/MA-GTS.git.

Abstract: Steganography is the art and science of covert writing, with a broad range of applications interwoven within the realm of cybersecurity. As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, its ability to synthesise realistic content emerges as a threat in the hands of cybercriminals who seek to manipulate and misrepresent the truth. Such synthetic content introduces a non-trivial risk of overwriting the subtle changes made for the purpose of steganography. When the signals in both the spatial and temporal domains are vulnerable to unforeseen overwriting, it calls for reflection on what can remain invariant after all. This study proposes a paradigm in steganography for audiovisual media, where messages are concealed beyond both spatial and temporal domains. A chain of multimodal agents is developed to deconstruct audiovisual content into a cover text, embed a message within the linguistic domain, and then reconstruct the audiovisual content through synchronising both aural and visual modalities with the resultant stego text. The message is encoded by biasing the word sampling process of a language generation model and decoded by analysing the probability distribution of word choices. The accuracy of message transmission is evaluated under both zero-bit and multi-bit capacity settings. Fidelity is assessed through both biometric and semantic similarities, capturing the identities of the recorded face and voice, as well as the core ideas conveyed through the media. Secrecy is examined through statistical comparisons between cover and stego texts. Robustness is tested across various scenarios, including audiovisual compression, face-swapping, voice-cloning and their combinations.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide alternative communication methods for individuals with motor disabilities by allowing control and interaction with external devices. Non-invasive BCIs, especially those using electroencephalography (EEG), are practical and safe for various applications. However, their performance is often hindered by EEG non-stationarities, caused by changing mental states or device characteristics like electrode impedance. This challenge has spurred research into adaptive BCIs that can handle such variations. In recent years, interest has grown in using error-related potentials (ErrPs) to enhance BCI performance. ErrPs, neural responses to errors, can be detected non-invasively and have been integrated into different BCI paradigms to improve performance through error correction or adaptation.
  This research introduces a novel adaptive ErrP-based BCI approach using reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate the feasibility of an RL-driven adaptive framework incorporating ErrPs and motor imagery. Utilizing two RL agents, the framework adapts dynamically to EEG non-stationarities. Validation was conducted using a publicly available motor imagery dataset and a fast-paced game designed to boost user engagement. Results show the framework's promise, with RL agents learning control policies from user interactions and achieving robust performance across datasets. However, a critical insight from the game-based protocol revealed that motor imagery in a high-speed interaction paradigm was largely ineffective for participants, highlighting task design limitations in real-time BCI applications. These findings underscore the potential of RL for adaptive BCIs while pointing out practical constraints related to task complexity and user responsiveness.

Abstract: Optimizing language models for use in conversational agents requires large quantities of example dialogues. Increasingly, these dialogues are synthetically generated by using powerful large language models (LLMs), especially in domains with challenges to obtain authentic human data. One such domain is human resources (HR). In this context, we compare two LLM-based dialogue generation methods for the use case of generating HR job interviews, and assess whether one method generates higher-quality dialogues that are more challenging to distinguish from genuine human discourse. The first method uses a single prompt to generate the complete interview dialog. The second method uses two agents that converse with each other. To evaluate dialogue quality under each method, we ask a judge LLM to determine whether AI was used for interview generation, using pairwise interview comparisons. We demonstrate that despite a sixfold increase in token cost, interviews generated with the dual-prompt method achieve a win rate up to ten times higher than those generated with the single-prompt method. This difference remains consistent regardless of whether GPT-4o or Llama 3.3 70B is used for either interview generation or judging quality.

Abstract: With the urbanization process, an increasing number of sensors are being deployed in transportation systems, leading to an explosion of big data. To harness the power of this vast transportation data, various machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been introduced to address numerous transportation challenges. However, these methods often require significant investment in data collection, processing, storage, and the employment of professionals with expertise in transportation and ML. Additionally, privacy issues are a major concern when processing data for real-world traffic control and management. To address these challenges, the research team proposes an innovative Multi-agent framework named Independent Mobility GPT (IDM-GPT) based on large language models (LLMs) for customized traffic analysis, management suggestions, and privacy preservation. IDM-GPT efficiently connects users, transportation databases, and ML models economically. IDM-GPT trains, customizes, and applies various LLM-based AI agents for multiple functions, including user query comprehension, prompts optimization, data analysis, model selection, and performance evaluation and enhancement. With IDM-GPT, users without any background in transportation or ML can efficiently and intuitively obtain data analysis and customized suggestions in near real-time based on their questions. Experimental results demonstrate that IDM-GPT delivers satisfactory performance across multiple traffic-related tasks, providing comprehensive and actionable insights that support effective traffic management and urban mobility improvement.

Abstract: AI programming tools enable powerful code generation, and recent prototypes attempt to reduce user effort with proactive AI agents, but their impact on programming workflows remains unexplored. We introduce and evaluate Codellaborator, a design probe LLM agent that initiates programming assistance based on editor activities and task context. We explored three interface variants to assess trade-offs between increasingly salient AI support: prompt-only, proactive agent, and proactive agent with presence and context (Codellaborator). In a within-subject study (N=18), we find that proactive agents increase efficiency compared to prompt-only paradigm, but also incur workflow disruptions. However, presence indicators and \revise{interaction context support} alleviated disruptions and improved users' awareness of AI processes. We underscore trade-offs of Codellaborator on user control, ownership, and code understanding, emphasizing the need to adapt proactivity to programming processes. Our research contributes to the design exploration and evaluation of proactive AI systems, presenting design implications on AI-integrated programming workflow.

Abstract: Using a sample of 25,000 Bing Copilot conversations, we study how the agent responds to users of varying levels of domain expertise and the resulting impact on user experience along multiple dimensions. Our findings show that across a variety of topical domains, the agent largely responds at proficient or expert levels of expertise (77% of conversations) which correlates with positive user experience regardless of the user's level of expertise. Misalignment, such that the agent responds at a level of expertise below that of the user, has a negative impact on overall user experience, with the impact more profound for more complex tasks. We also show that users engage more, as measured by the number of words in the conversation, when the agent responds at a level of expertise commensurate with that of the user. Our findings underscore the importance of alignment between user and AI when designing human-centered AI systems, to ensure satisfactory and productive interactions.

总结:
本文提出了一种针对角色扮演游戏(RPG)的新型框架——投票基于的任务分配(VBTA)，旨在提高游戏中智能代理对玩家情感状态和语境细微差别的理解与交互质量。VBTA通过赋予游戏代理能力和任务需求描述，生成适应性矩阵以量化两者间的匹配程度。利用预训练的大型语言模型、六种不同的投票方法以及冲突解决的路径规划算法(CBS)，该框架能够高效地识别并指派最适合执行各项任务的游戏代理。相较于现有的专注于生成单一游戏元素如任务或战斗场景的方法，VBTA由于其泛化特性，在生成独特战斗遭遇与叙事方面展现出潜力。 <div>

Abstract: In role-playing games (RPGs), the level of immersion is critical-especially when an in-game agent conveys tasks, hints, or ideas to the player. For an agent to accurately interpret the player's emotional state and contextual nuances, a foundational level of understanding is required, which can be achieved using a Large Language Model (LLM). Maintaining the LLM's focus across multiple context changes, however, necessitates a more robust approach, such as integrating the LLM with a dedicated task allocation model to guide its performance throughout gameplay. In response to this need, we introduce Voting-Based Task Assignment (VBTA), a framework inspired by human reasoning in task allocation and completion. VBTA assigns capability profiles to agents and task descriptions to tasks, then generates a suitability matrix that quantifies the alignment between an agent's abilities and a task's requirements. Leveraging six distinct voting methods, a pre-trained LLM, and integrating conflict-based search (CBS) for path planning, VBTA efficiently identifies and assigns the most suitable agent to each task. While existing approaches focus on generating individual aspects of gameplay, such as single quests, or combat encounters, our method shows promise when generating both unique combat encounters and narratives because of its generalizable nature.

<div> 关键词: 零样本命名实体识别 (Zero-shot NER)，大型语言模型 (LLMs)，合作多智能体系统 (CMAS)，实体类型相关特征 (TRF)，演示鉴别器

总结:
本文提出了一个用于零样本命名实体识别 (Zero-shot NER) 的新框架——合作多智能体系统 (CMAS)。该框架通过利用多个智能体的集体智慧来解决现有方法中两个主要挑战：忽视实体上下文之间的关联性以及不加区分地使用任务示例导致的误导问题。CMAS 包含四个主要智能体：自注释器、类型相关特征提取器、演示鉴别器和总体预测器。CMAS 将 NER 重新定义为两个子任务：识别命名实体和确定目标句子中的实体类型相关特征，以显式捕捉实体上下文的相关性。同时，为了实现对示例的可控利用，它建立了一个演示鉴别器，自动评估目标句子中示例的有用性分数。实验结果显示，CMAS 在六个基准数据集（包括特定领域和通用领域）上的零样本 NER 性能有显著提升，并且在少量样本设置和不同 LLM 后端中也显示出了有效性。 <div>

Abstract: Zero-shot named entity recognition (NER) aims to develop entity recognition systems from unannotated text corpora. This task presents substantial challenges due to minimal human intervention. Recent work has adapted large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot NER by crafting specialized prompt templates. It advances model self-learning abilities by incorporating self-annotated demonstrations. However, two important challenges persist: (i) Correlations between contexts surrounding entities are overlooked, leading to wrong type predictions or entity omissions. (ii) The indiscriminate use of task demonstrations, retrieved through shallow similarity-based strategies, severely misleads LLMs during inference.
  In this paper, we introduce the cooperative multi-agent system (CMAS), a novel framework for zero-shot NER that uses the collective intelligence of multiple agents to address the challenges outlined above. CMAS has four main agents: (i) a self-annotator, (ii) a type-related feature (TRF) extractor, (iii) a demonstration discriminator, and (iv) an overall predictor. To explicitly capture correlations between contexts surrounding entities, CMAS reformulates NER into two subtasks: recognizing named entities and identifying entity type-related features within the target sentence. To enable controllable utilization of demonstrations, a demonstration discriminator is established to incorporate the self-reflection mechanism, automatically evaluating helpfulness scores for the target sentence. Experimental results show that CMAS significantly improves zero-shot NER performance across six benchmarks, including both domain-specific and general-domain scenarios. Furthermore, CMAS demonstrates its effectiveness in few-shot settings and with various LLM backbones.

<div> 关键词：Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)，reward hacking，reward shaping，Preference As Reward (PAR)，data efficiency

总结:
本文针对强化学习从人类反馈（RLHF）中的奖励黑客问题进行了研究，并提出了稳定和优化该过程的关键设计原则。文章指出了三种关键设计原则：(1) 强化学习的奖励应理想上具有界限；(2) 强化学习受益于快速初始增长后逐渐收敛的过程；(3) 奖励最好表述为与中心化奖励相关的函数。基于这些洞察，作者提出了一种新的奖励塑造方法——Preference As Reward (PAR)，该方法利用嵌入在奖励模型本身的潜在偏好作为强化学习的信号。实验结果显示，PAR在Gemma2-2B和Llama3-8B两个基线模型以及Ultrafeedback-Binarized和HH-RLHF两个数据集上的表现优于其他奖励塑造方法，在AlpacaEval 2.0基准测试中，其胜率至少比其他方法高出5个百分点。此外，PAR还表现出出色的数据效率，仅需一个参考奖励即可达到最佳性能，并在经过两轮完整训练后仍能保持对奖励黑客攻击的稳健性。相关代码可在https://github.com/PorUna-byte/PAR获取。 <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF is susceptible to reward hacking, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. While reward shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying principles remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests three key design principles: (1) RL reward is ideally bounded, (2) RL benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence, and (3) RL reward is best formulated as a function of centered reward. Guided by these insights, we propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent preferences embedded within the reward model itself as the signal for reinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B and Llama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF. Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward shaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate at least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even after two full epochs of training. Code is available at https://github.com/PorUna-byte/PAR.

<title>It's Not All Black and White: Degree of Truthfulness for Risk-Avoiding Agents</title>

<div> 关键词：truthfulness、risk-avoiding truthfulness (RAT)、RAT-degree、manipulation、social choice settings

<br /><br />总结:
本文提出了一个介于经典诚实性与风险避免诚实性(RAT)之间的新概念——RAT度，用于描述机制被安全操纵的难易程度。RAT度定义为最少需要知道多少个参与者的报告，其他参与者才能进行无害的操纵，若不存在这样的数字则为n。这一概念填补了完全了解他人信息和完全不了解之间的真实情况。文中通过分析拍卖、不可分割商品分配、蛋糕切割、投票以及稳定匹配等社会选择场景中著名机制的RAT度，展示了该概念的普适性和应用价值。 <div>
arXiv:2502.18805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic notion of truthfulness requires that no agent has a profitable manipulation -- an untruthful report that, for some combination of reports of the other agents, increases her utility. This strong notion implicitly assumes that the manipulating agent either knows what all other agents are going to report, or is willing to take the risk and act as-if she knows their reports.
  Without knowledge of the others' reports, most manipulations are risky -- they might decrease the manipulator's utility for some other combinations of reports by the other agents. Accordingly, a recent paper (Bu, Song and Tao, ``On the existence of truthful fair cake cutting mechanisms'', Artificial Intelligence 319 (2023), 103904) suggests a relaxed notion, which we refer to as risk-avoiding truthfulness (RAT), which requires only that no agent can gain from a safe manipulation -- one that is sometimes beneficial and never harmful.
  Truthfulness and RAT are two extremes: the former considers manipulators with complete knowledge of others, whereas the latter considers manipulators with no knowledge at all. In reality, agents often know about some -- but not all -- of the other agents. This paper introduces the RAT-degree of a mechanism, defined as the smallest number of agents whose reports, if known, may allow another agent to safely manipulate, or $n$ if there is no such number. This notion interpolates between classic truthfulness (degree $n$) and RAT (degree at least $1$): a mechanism with a higher RAT-degree is harder to manipulate safely.
  To illustrate the generality and applicability of this concept, we analyze the RAT-degree of prominent mechanisms across various social choice settings, including auctions, indivisible goods allocations, cake-cutting, voting, and stable matchings.

Abstract: In this project, our goal is to determine how to leverage the world-knowledge of pretrained large language models for efficient and robust learning in multiagent decision making. We examine this in a taxi routing and assignment problem where agents must decide how to best pick up passengers in order to minimize overall waiting time. While this problem is situated on a graphical road network, we show that with the proper prompting zero-shot performance is quite strong on this task. Furthermore, with limited fine-tuning along with the one-at-a-time rollout algorithm for look ahead, LLMs can out-compete existing approaches with 50 times fewer environmental interactions. We also explore the benefits of various linguistic prompting approaches and show that including certain easy-to-compute information in the prompt significantly improves performance. Finally, we highlight the LLM's built-in semantic understanding, showing its ability to adapt to environmental factors through simple prompts.

Abstract: This benchmark suite provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing both individual LLMs and multi-agent systems in real-world planning scenarios. The suite encompasses eleven designed problems that progress from basic to highly complex, incorporating key aspects such as multi-agent coordination, inter-agent dependencies, and dynamic environmental disruptions. Each problem can be scaled along three dimensions: the number of parallel planning threads, the complexity of inter-dependencies, and the frequency of unexpected disruptions requiring real-time adaptation. The benchmark includes detailed specifications, evaluation metrics, and baseline implementations using contemporary frameworks like LangGraph, enabling rigorous testing of both single-agent and multi-agent planning capabilities. Through standardized evaluation criteria and scalable complexity, this benchmark aims to drive progress in developing more robust and adaptable AI planning systems for real-world applications.

Abstract: Scientific discovery relies on scientists generating novel hypotheses that undergo rigorous experimental validation. To augment this process, we introduce an AI co-scientist, a multi-agent system built on Gemini 2.0. The AI co-scientist is intended to help uncover new, original knowledge and to formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon prior evidence and aligned to scientist-provided research objectives and guidance. The system's design incorporates a generate, debate, and evolve approach to hypothesis generation, inspired by the scientific method and accelerated by scaling test-time compute. Key contributions include: (1) a multi-agent architecture with an asynchronous task execution framework for flexible compute scaling; (2) a tournament evolution process for self-improving hypotheses generation. Automated evaluations show continued benefits of test-time compute, improving hypothesis quality. While general purpose, we focus development and validation in three biomedical areas: drug repurposing, novel target discovery, and explaining mechanisms of bacterial evolution and anti-microbial resistance. For drug repurposing, the system proposes candidates with promising validation findings, including candidates for acute myeloid leukemia that show tumor inhibition in vitro at clinically applicable concentrations. For novel target discovery, the AI co-scientist proposed new epigenetic targets for liver fibrosis, validated by anti-fibrotic activity and liver cell regeneration in human hepatic organoids. Finally, the AI co-scientist recapitulated unpublished experimental results via a parallel in silico discovery of a novel gene transfer mechanism in bacterial evolution. These results, detailed in separate, co-timed reports, demonstrate the potential to augment biomedical and scientific discovery and usher an era of AI empowered scientists.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to their limitations in addressing the vast reasoning space and inherent ambiguities of natural language. We propose the Mixture-of-Search-Agents (MoSA) paradigm, a novel approach leveraging the collective expertise of multiple LLMs to enhance search-based reasoning. MoSA integrates diverse reasoning pathways by combining independent exploration with iterative refinement among LLMs, mitigating the limitations of single-model approaches. Using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as a backbone, MoSA enables multiple agents to propose and aggregate reasoning steps, resulting in improved accuracy. Our comprehensive evaluation across four reasoning benchmarks demonstrates MoSA's consistent performance improvements over single-agent and other multi-agent baselines, particularly in complex mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks.

Abstract: A major challenge to deploying cyber-physical systems with learning-enabled controllers is to ensure their safety, especially in the face of changing environments that necessitate runtime knowledge acquisition. Model-checking and automated reasoning have been successfully used for shielding, i.e., to monitor untrusted controllers and override potentially unsafe decisions, but only at the cost of hard tradeoffs in terms of expressivity, safety, adaptivity, precision and runtime efficiency. We propose a programming-language framework that allows experts to statically specify adaptive shields for learning-enabled agents, which enforce a safe control envelope that gets more permissive as knowledge is gathered at runtime. A shield specification provides a safety model that is parametric in the current agent's knowledge. In addition, a nondeterministic inference strategy can be specified using a dedicated domain-specific language, enforcing that such knowledge parameters are inferred at runtime in a statistically-sound way. By leveraging language design and theorem proving, our proposed framework empowers experts to design adaptive shields with an unprecedented level of modeling flexibility, while providing rigorous, end-to-end probabilistic safety guarantees.

Abstract: Young adults often encounter challenges in career exploration. Self-guided interventions, such as the letter-exchange exercise, where participants envision and adopt the perspective of their future selves by exchanging letters with their envisioned future selves, can support career development. However, the broader adoption of such interventions may be limited without structured guidance. To address this, we integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents that simulate participants' future selves into the letter-exchange exercise and evaluated their effectiveness. A one-week experiment (N=36) compared three conditions: (1) participants manually writing replies to themselves from the perspective of their future selves (baseline), (2) future-self agents generating letters to participants, and (3) future-self agents engaging in chat conversations with participants. Results indicated that exchanging letters with future-self agents enhanced participants' engagement during the exercise, while overall benefits of the intervention on future orientation, career self-concept, and psychological support remained comparable across conditions. We discuss design implications for AI-augmented interventions for supporting young adults' career exploration.

Abstract: In multi-robot system (MRS) applications, efficient task assignment is essential not only for coordinating agents and ensuring mission success but also for maintaining overall system security. In this work, we first propose an optimization-based distributed task assignment algorithm that dynamically assigns mandatory security-critical tasks and optional tasks among teams. Leveraging an inexact Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based approach, we decompose the task assignment problem into separable and non-separable subproblems. The non-separable subproblems are transformed into an inexact ADMM update by projected gradient descent, which can be performed through several communication steps within the team.
  In the second part of this paper, we formulate a comprehensive framework that enables MRS under plan-deviation attacks to handle online tasks without compromising security. The process begins with a security analysis that determines whether an online task can be executed securely by a robot and, if so, the required time and location for the robot to rejoin the team. Next, the proposed task assignment algorithm is used to allocate security-related tasks and verified online tasks. Finally, task fulfillment is managed using a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF)-based controller, while security enforcement is ensured through a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based security filter. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed framework allows MRS to effectively respond to unplanned online tasks while maintaining security guarantees.

本文提出了一种环境自由的强化学习框架，用于训练针对GUI代理的视觉语言模型。该框架通过预训练的价值环境模型(VEM)解决了环境基RL所需的昂贵交互问题以及环境自由方法面临的分布偏移和奖励泛化挑战。VEM能直接从离线数据中预测状态-动作值，无需预测下一个状态或环境反馈，从而提炼出关于GUI交互结果的人类类似优先级理解，降低了误差累积并增强了对UI变化的适应性。框架分为两阶段：(1) 预训练VEM以估计长期行动效用；(2) 使用冻结的VEM信号引导策略探索，实现布局无关的GUI自动化。在Android-in-the-Wild基准测试中，VEM在离线和在线设置下均达到最佳性能，显著优于环境自由基线，并与需要交互成本的环境基方法表现相当。重要的是，VEM表明语义感知的价值估计可以实现与在线训练方法相媲美的性能。 <div>

Abstract: Training Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) agents via Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces critical challenges: environment-based RL requires costly interactions, while environment-free methods struggle with distribution shift and reward generalization. We propose an environment-free RL framework that decouples value estimation from policy optimization by leveraging a pretrained Value Environment Model (VEM). VEM predicts state-action values directly from offline data, distilling human-like priors about GUI interaction outcomes without requiring next-state prediction or environmental feedback. This avoids compounding errors and enhances resilience to UI changes by focusing on semantic reasoning (e.g., Does this action advance the user's goal?). The framework operates in two stages: (1) pretraining VEM to estimate long-term action utilities and (2) guiding policy exploration with frozen VEM signals, enabling layout-agnostic GUI automation. Evaluated on Android-in-the-Wild benchmarks, VEM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both offline and online settings, outperforming environment-free baselines significantly and matching environment-based approaches without interaction costs. Importantly, VEM demonstrates that semantic-aware value estimation can achieve comparable performance with online-trained methods.

总结:
本文介绍了针对离线强化学习的研究新方法ReDOR，该方法着重解决如何从预收集的数据集中选择最优子集以提升算法性能和训练效率这一关键而未充分探索的挑战。ReDOR将数据集选择视为一个梯度逼近优化问题，并通过将常见的actor-critic框架重新表述为子模优化目标，实现了高效子集选取。为此，文章采用了正交匹配追踪(OMP)并进行了适应性的修改，特别针对离线RL场景。实验结果显示，通过ReDOR识别出的数据子集不仅能显著提高算法性能，而且还能以更低的计算复杂性实现这一目标。 <div>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) represents a significant shift in RL research, allowing agents to learn from pre-collected datasets without further interaction with the environment. A key, yet underexplored, challenge in offline RL is selecting an optimal subset of the offline dataset that enhances both algorithm performance and training efficiency. Reducing dataset size can also reveal the minimal data requirements necessary for solving similar problems. In response to this challenge, we introduce ReDOR (Reduced Datasets for Offline RL), a method that frames dataset selection as a gradient approximation optimization problem. We demonstrate that the widely used actor-critic framework in RL can be reformulated as a submodular optimization objective, enabling efficient subset selection. To achieve this, we adapt orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), incorporating several novel modifications tailored for offline RL. Our experimental results show that the data subsets identified by ReDOR not only boost algorithm performance but also do so with significantly lower computational complexity.

总结:
本文研究了多种现实世界的系统中协调问题，例如交通网络、供应链和能源网格，其中许多代理实体需要学会共享资源。文中指出独立且自私的交互可能导致效率低下，即所谓的“价格混乱”。文章关注于利用推荐系统作为减少价格混乱并保持个体自主性的有效干预手段。以与道路交通、互联网数据包传输及电力电网相关的Braess悖论为例，作者采用近期文献中的方法，将代理实体之间的交互建模为Q学习者的重复游戏。文章提出了学习动态操纵问题，即外部推荐系统可以通过选择Q学习者在学习过程中观察到的状态来策略性地引导行为。计算贡献部分表明，适当的选择性推荐可以稳健地引导系统收敛至社会最优解，即使涉及多个玩家也是如此。理论和实证结果强调，推荐空间的增加能够提高推荐系统的引导潜力，这一点应在设计推荐系统时予以考虑。 <div>

Abstract: Varied real world systems such as transportation networks, supply chains and energy grids present coordination problems where many agents must learn to share resources. It is well known that the independent and selfish interactions of agents in these systems may lead to inefficiencies, often referred to as the `Price of Anarchy'. Effective interventions that reduce the Price of Anarchy while preserving individual autonomy are of great interest. In this paper we explore recommender systems as one such intervention mechanism. We start with the Braess Paradox, a congestion game model of a routing problem related to traffic on roads, packets on the internet, and electricity on power grids. Following recent literature, we model the interactions of agents as a repeated game between $Q$-learners, a common type of reinforcement learning agents. This work introduces the Learning Dynamic Manipulation Problem, where an external recommender system can strategically trigger behavior by picking the states observed by $Q$-learners during learning. Our computational contribution demonstrates that appropriately chosen recommendations can robustly steer the system towards convergence to the social optimum, even for many players. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight that increases in the recommendation space can increase the steering potential of a recommender system, which should be considered in the design of recommender systems.

总结:<br />
本文提出了一个名为Ground-level Viewpoint Navigation (GVNav)的方法，旨在解决视觉与语言导航(VLN)中因人类视角指令与低高度视野四足机器人的差距所带来的问题。GVNav通过使用加权的历史观察结果作为增强的时空上下文来改进指令跟随，有效地处理不同视角下相同特征的权重分配，帮助低高度机器人克服视觉遮挡和感知不匹配的挑战。此外，该方法还利用HM3D和Gibson数据集中的连通性图，以增强空间先验知识和更全面地表征现实世界场景，从而提升在真实环境中预测路点的性能和泛化能力。实验表明，GVNav方法在模拟环境和真实的四足机器人部署中都显著提高了性能。 <div>

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) empowers agents to associate time-sequenced visual observations with corresponding instructions to make sequential decisions. However, generalization remains a persistent challenge, particularly when dealing with visually diverse scenes or transitioning from simulated environments to real-world deployment. In this paper, we address the mismatch between human-centric instructions and quadruped robots with a low-height field of view, proposing a Ground-level Viewpoint Navigation (GVNav) approach to mitigate this issue. This work represents the first attempt to highlight the generalization gap in VLN across varying heights of visual observation in realistic robot deployments. Our approach leverages weighted historical observations as enriched spatiotemporal contexts for instruction following, effectively managing feature collisions within cells by assigning appropriate weights to identical features across different viewpoints. This enables low-height robots to overcome challenges such as visual obstructions and perceptual mismatches. Additionally, we transfer the connectivity graph from the HM3D and Gibson datasets as an extra resource to enhance spatial priors and a more comprehensive representation of real-world scenarios, leading to improved performance and generalizability of the waypoint predictor in real-world environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Ground-level Viewpoint Navigation (GVnav) approach significantly improves performance in both simulated environments and real-world deployments with quadruped robots.

本文介绍了大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言提示驱动的代码生成方面的显著能力及其对软件开发工作流的革新作用。然而，当前评估多语种代码生成能力的基准主要以英语为中心，限制了其在全球开发者社区中的适用性。为解决这一问题，文章提出了IndicEval-XL，一个全面的代码生成基准评测，该评测涵盖了大约占世界人口14%的六大印度语言，并将这些语言与12种编程语言相结合，构建了一个强大的评价框架。鉴于印度占据全球人口的八分之一以及印度语言在印度社会中的重要角色，IndicEval-XL对于扩展代码生成系统和评价框架的语言多样性具有重要意义。通过支持多种语言的研发资源，旨在使AI驱动的开发工具更加包容并易于不同语言背景的开发者使用。为了促进这一领域的进一步研究和发展，作者将其数据集和评价基准公开发布在https://github.com/telekom/IndicEval-XL上。 <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation from natural language prompts, revolutionizing software development workflows. As we advance towards agent-based development paradigms, these models form the cornerstone of next-generation software development lifecycles. However, current benchmarks for evaluating multilingual code generation capabilities are predominantly English-centric, limiting their applicability across the global developer community. To address this limitation, we present IndicEval-XL, a comprehensive benchmark for code generation that incorporates 6 major Indic languages, collectively spoken by approximately 14\% of the world's population. Our benchmark bridges these languages with 12 programming languages, creating a robust evaluation framework. This work is particularly significant given India's representation of one-eighth of the global population and the crucial role Indic languages play in Indian society. IndicEval-XL represents a significant step toward expanding the linguistic diversity in code generation systems and evaluation frameworks. By developing resources that support multiple languages, we aim to make AI-powered development tools more inclusive and accessible to developers of various linguistic backgrounds. To facilitate further research and development in this direction, we make our dataset and evaluation benchmark publicly available at https://github.com/telekom/IndicEval-XL

Abstract: Cross-site scripting (XSS) poses a significant threat to web application security. While Deep Learning (DL) has shown remarkable success in detecting XSS attacks, it remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to the discontinuous nature of its input-output mapping. These adversarial attacks employ mutation-based strategies for different components of XSS attack vectors, allowing adversarial agents to iteratively select mutations to evade detection. Our work replicates a state-of-the-art XSS adversarial attack, highlighting threats to validity in the reference work and extending it toward a more effective evaluation strategy. Moreover, we introduce an XSS Oracle to mitigate these threats. The experimental results show that our approach achieves an escape rate above 96% when the threats to validity of the replicated technique are addressed.

总结:
本文研究了在社会系统中意见演化的现象，重点关注语言和论证谬误的影响。为了填补这一研究空白，作者提出了LODAS——一种基于代理的模拟语言驱动的意见动态模型。该模型通过模拟围绕“忒修斯之船”悖论的辩论，探讨了不同意见分布（平衡、极化和不平衡）下，代理人如何通过接受、拒绝或忽略提出的论点来演变其观点。研究发现，LLM（大型语言模型）代理人在互动过程中展现出趋同性和迎合性特征，几乎在任何环境下都能达成共识。此外，这些AI代理往往会产生说服性但含有逻辑谬误的论点，并且他们容易受到建立在逻辑谬误基础上的论点影响。这一框架不仅可用于模拟社会动态，还有助于从另一个角度探究LLMs的偏见和缺陷，及其可能对与人类交互产生的影响。 <div>

Abstract: Understanding how opinions evolve is crucial for addressing issues such as polarization, radicalization, and consensus in social systems. While much research has focused on identifying factors influencing opinion change, the role of language and argumentative fallacies remains underexplored. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating how language - along with social dynamics - influences opinion evolution through LODAS, a Language-Driven Opinion Dynamics Model for Agent-Based Simulations. The model simulates debates around the "Ship of Theseus" paradox, in which agents with discrete opinions interact with each other and evolve their opinions by accepting, rejecting, or ignoring the arguments presented. We study three different scenarios: balanced, polarized, and unbalanced opinion distributions. Agreeableness and sycophancy emerge as two main characteristics of LLM agents, and consensus around the presented statement emerges almost in any setting. Moreover, such AI agents are often producers of fallacious arguments in the attempt of persuading their peers and - for their complacency - they are also highly influenced by arguments built on logical fallacies. These results highlight the potential of this framework not only for simulating social dynamics but also for exploring from another perspective biases and shortcomings of LLMs, which may impact their interactions with humans.

Abstract: Much of the success of multi-agent debates depends on carefully choosing the right parameters. Among them, the decision-making protocol stands out. Systematic comparison of decision protocols is difficult because studies alter multiple discussion parameters beyond the protocol. So far, it has been largely unknown how decision-making addresses the challenges of different tasks. This work systematically evaluates the impact of seven decision protocols (e.g., majority voting, unanimity consensus). We change only one variable at a time (i.e., decision protocol) to analyze how different methods affect the collaboration between agents and test different protocols on knowledge (MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA) and reasoning datasets (StrategyQA, MuSR, SQuAD 2.0). Our results show that voting protocols improve performance by 13.2% in reasoning tasks and consensus protocols by 2.8% in knowledge tasks over the other decision protocol. Increasing the number of agents improves performance, while more discussion rounds before voting reduces it. To improve decision-making by increasing answer diversity, we propose two new methods, All-Agents Drafting (AAD) and Collective Improvement (CI). Our methods improve task performance by up to 3.3% with AAD and up to 7.4% with CI. This work demonstrates the importance of decision-making in multi-agent debates beyond scaling.

Abstract: As AI agents are increasingly adopted to collaborate on complex objectives, ensuring the security of autonomous multi-agent systems becomes crucial. We develop simulations of agents collaborating on shared objectives to study these security risks and security trade-offs. We focus on scenarios where an attacker compromises one agent, using it to steer the entire system toward misaligned outcomes by corrupting other agents. In this context, we observe infectious malicious prompts - the multi-hop spreading of malicious instructions. To mitigate this risk, we evaluated several strategies: two "vaccination" approaches that insert false memories of safely handling malicious input into the agents' memory stream, and two versions of a generic safety instruction strategy. While these defenses reduce the spread and fulfillment of malicious instructions in our experiments, they tend to decrease collaboration capability in the agent network. Our findings illustrate potential trade-off between security and collaborative efficiency in multi-agent systems, providing insights for designing more secure yet effective AI collaborations.

Abstract: Differential Diagnosis (DDx) is a fundamental yet complex aspect of clinical decision-making, in which physicians iteratively refine a ranked list of possible diseases based on symptoms, antecedents, and medical knowledge. While recent advances in large language models have shown promise in supporting DDx, existing approaches face key limitations, including single-dataset evaluations, isolated optimization of components, unrealistic assumptions about complete patient profiles, and single-attempt diagnosis. We introduce a Modular Explainable DDx Agent (MEDDxAgent) framework designed for interactive DDx, where diagnostic reasoning evolves through iterative learning, rather than assuming a complete patient profile is accessible. MEDDxAgent integrates three modular components: (1) an orchestrator (DDxDriver), (2) a history taking simulator, and (3) two specialized agents for knowledge retrieval and diagnosis strategy. To ensure robust evaluation, we introduce a comprehensive DDx benchmark covering respiratory, skin, and rare diseases. We analyze single-turn diagnostic approaches and demonstrate the importance of iterative refinement when patient profiles are not available at the outset. Our broad evaluation demonstrates that MEDDxAgent achieves over 10% accuracy improvements in interactive DDx across both large and small LLMs, while offering critical explainability into its diagnostic reasoning process.

Abstract: Social media platforms frequently impose restrictive policies to moderate user content, prompting the emergence of creative evasion language strategies. This paper presents a multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the iterative evolution of language strategies under regulatory constraints. In this framework, participant agents, as social media users, continuously evolve their language expression, while supervisory agents emulate platform-level regulation by assessing policy violations. To achieve a more faithful simulation, we employ a dual design of language strategies (constraint and expression) to differentiate conflicting goals and utilize an LLM-driven GA (Genetic Algorithm) for the selection, mutation, and crossover of language strategies. The framework is evaluated using two distinct scenarios: an abstract password game and a realistic simulated illegal pet trade scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that as the number of dialogue rounds increases, both the number of uninterrupted dialogue turns and the accuracy of information transmission improve significantly. Furthermore, a user study with 40 participants validates the real-world relevance of the generated dialogues and strategies. Moreover, ablation studies validate the importance of the GA, emphasizing its contribution to long-term adaptability and improved overall results.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence requires agents to interact with 3D environments in real time based on language instructions. A foundational task in this domain is ego-centric 3D visual grounding. However, the point clouds rendered from RGB-D images retain a large amount of redundant background data and inherent noise, both of which can interfere with the manifold structure of the target regions. Existing point cloud enhancement methods often require a tedious process to improve the manifold, which is not suitable for real-time tasks. We propose Proxy Transformation suitable for multimodal task to efficiently improve the point cloud manifold. Our method first leverages Deformable Point Clustering to identify the point cloud sub-manifolds in target regions. Then, we propose a Proxy Attention module that utilizes multimodal proxies to guide point cloud transformation. Built upon Proxy Attention, we design a submanifold transformation generation module where textual information globally guides translation vectors for different submanifolds, optimizing relative spatial relationships of target regions. Simultaneously, image information guides linear transformations within each submanifold, refining the local point cloud manifold of target regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Proxy Transformation significantly outperforms all existing methods, achieving an impressive improvement of 7.49% on easy targets and 4.60% on hard targets, while reducing the computational overhead of attention blocks by 40.6%. These results establish a new SOTA in ego-centric 3D visual grounding, showcasing the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Emirates Multi-Task (EMT) dataset - the first publicly available dataset for autonomous driving collected in the Arab Gulf region. The EMT dataset captures the unique road topology, high traffic congestion, and distinctive characteristics of the Gulf region, including variations in pedestrian clothing and weather conditions. It contains over 30,000 frames from a dash-camera perspective, along with 570,000 annotated bounding boxes, covering approximately 150 kilometers of driving routes. The EMT dataset supports three primary tasks: tracking, trajectory forecasting and intention prediction. Each benchmark dataset is complemented with corresponding evaluations: (1) multi-agent tracking experiments, focusing on multi-class scenarios and occlusion handling; (2) trajectory forecasting evaluation using deep sequential and interaction-aware models; and (3) intention benchmark experiments conducted for predicting agents intentions from observed trajectories.

<div> 关键词: CritiQ, 数据选择, 语言模型, 人类偏好, 继续训练

总结:
本文介绍了CritiQ，一种新的数据选择方法，旨在优化语言模型性能。CritiQ仅需约30对人工标注的数据即可自动挖掘出基于人类偏好的质量标准。其核心组件CritiQ Flow采用经理代理来进化质量标准，而工作者代理则进行pairwise判断。为了提升CritiQ Flow的效果，建立了从以往工作提取质量标准的知识库。与基于困惑度和分类器的方法相比，使用CritiQ得到的质量标准更具有可解释性和可复用性。利用这些标准，CritiQ Scorer为数据打分并进行高效选择。实验表明，该方法在代码、数学和逻辑等领域均取得高准确性，并通过继续训练Llama 3.1模型，相较于均匀采样，下游任务性能有所提升。此外，消融研究证实了知识库和反思过程的优势。文章还分析了标准的演化以及多数投票的有效性。 <div>

Abstract: Language model heavily depends on high-quality data for optimal performance. Existing approaches rely on manually designed heuristics, the perplexity of existing models, training classifiers, or careful prompt engineering, which require significant expert experience and human annotation effort while introduce biases. We introduce CritiQ, a novel data selection method that automatically mines criteria from human preferences for data quality with only $\sim$30 human-annotated pairs and performs efficient data selection. The main component, CritiQ Flow, employs a manager agent to evolve quality criteria and worker agents to make pairwise judgments. We build a knowledge base that extracts quality criteria from previous work to boost CritiQ Flow. Compared to perplexity- and classifier- based methods, verbal criteria are more interpretable and possess reusable value. After deriving the criteria, we train the CritiQ Scorer to give quality scores and perform efficient data selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the code, math, and logic domains, achieving high accuracy on human-annotated test sets. To validate the quality of the selected data, we continually train Llama 3.1 models and observe improved performance on downstream tasks compared to uniform sampling. Ablation studies validate the benefits of the knowledge base and the reflection process. We analyze how criteria evolve and the effectiveness of majority voting.

总结:
<br />
本文针对多智能体强化学习（MARL）面临的因状态和动作空间指数增长以及非平稳环境导致的显著样本效率低下和泛化能力不足的问题。特别是在关系设定中，尽管领域知识至关重要，但现有的MARL算法往往未能充分利用。为解决这些问题，文章提出将关系规划器作为集中式控制器，结合有效的状态抽象和强化学习进行集成。这种方法证明了其样例效率高，并有助于实现任务转移和泛化的有效提升。 <div>
arXiv:2502.19297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) poses significant challenges due to the exponential growth of state and action spaces and the non-stationary nature of multiagent environments. This results in notable sample inefficiency and hinders generalization across diverse tasks. The complexity is further pronounced in relational settings, where domain knowledge is crucial but often underutilized by existing MARL algorithms. To overcome these hurdles, we propose integrating relational planners as centralized controllers with efficient state abstractions and reinforcement learning. This approach proves to be sample-efficient and facilitates effective task transfer and generalization.

arXiv:2502.19298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more specialized, we envision a future where millions of expert LLMs exist, each trained on proprietary data and excelling in specific domains. In such a system, answering a query requires selecting a small subset of relevant models, querying them efficiently, and synthesizing their responses. This paper introduces a framework for agent-centric information access, where LLMs function as knowledge agents that are dynamically ranked and queried based on their demonstrated expertise. Unlike traditional document retrieval, this approach requires inferring expertise on the fly, rather than relying on static metadata or predefined model descriptions. This shift introduces several challenges, including efficient expert selection, cost-effective querying, response aggregation across multiple models, and robustness against adversarial manipulation. To address these issues, we propose a scalable evaluation framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation and clustering techniques to construct and assess thousands of specialized models, with the potential to scale toward millions.

arXiv:2502.19308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce WOFOSTGym, a novel crop simulation environment designed to train reinforcement learning (RL) agents to optimize agromanagement decisions for annual and perennial crops in single and multi-farm settings. Effective crop management requires optimizing yield and economic returns while minimizing environmental impact, a complex sequential decision-making problem well suited for RL. However, the lack of simulators for perennial crops in multi-farm contexts has hindered RL applications in this domain. Existing crop simulators also do not support multiple annual crops. WOFOSTGym addresses these gaps by supporting 23 annual crops and two perennial crops, enabling RL agents to learn diverse agromanagement strategies in multi-year, multi-crop, and multi-farm settings. Our simulator offers a suite of challenging tasks for learning under partial observability, non-Markovian dynamics, and delayed feedback. WOFOSTGym's standard RL interface allows researchers without agricultural expertise to explore a wide range of agromanagement problems. Our experiments demonstrate the learned behaviors across various crop varieties and soil types, highlighting WOFOSTGym's potential for advancing RL-driven decision support in agriculture.

本文提出了一种新型的合作感知框架CoopDETR，旨在解决自动驾驶车辆(AVs)的合作感知问题并优化传输成本。该框架通过对象查询实现对象级特征合作，包含两个关键模块：单-Agent查询生成，能有效将原始传感器数据编码为对象查询，降低传输成本的同时保持检测所需的必要信息；以及跨-Agent查询融合，利用空间查询匹配(SQM)和对象查询聚合(OQA)实现查询间的高效交互。实验结果显示，CoopDETR在OPV2V和V2XSet数据集上达到了最先进的性能，并将传输成本降低了至先前方法的1/782。 <div>
arXiv:2502.19313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative perception enhances the individual perception capabilities of autonomous vehicles (AVs) by providing a comprehensive view of the environment. However, balancing perception performance and transmission costs remains a significant challenge. Current approaches that transmit region-level features across agents are limited in interpretability and demand substantial bandwidth, making them unsuitable for practical applications. In this work, we propose CoopDETR, a novel cooperative perception framework that introduces object-level feature cooperation via object query. Our framework consists of two key modules: single-agent query generation, which efficiently encodes raw sensor data into object queries, reducing transmission cost while preserving essential information for detection; and cross-agent query fusion, which includes Spatial Query Matching (SQM) and Object Query Aggregation (OQA) to enable effective interaction between queries. Our experiments on the OPV2V and V2XSet datasets demonstrate that CoopDETR achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly reduces transmission costs to 1/782 of previous methods.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for the training and inference-time scaling up of large language models (LLMs). However, existing reward models primarily focus on human preferences, neglecting verifiable correctness signals which have shown strong potential in training LLMs. In this paper, we propose agentic reward modeling, a reward system that combines reward models with verifiable correctness signals from different aspects to provide reliable rewards. We empirically implement a reward agent, named RewardAgent, that combines human preference rewards with two verifiable signals: factuality and instruction following, to provide more reliable rewards. We conduct comprehensive experiments on existing reward model benchmarks and inference time best-of-n searches on real-world downstream tasks. RewardAgent significantly outperforms vanilla reward models, demonstrating its effectiveness. We further construct training preference pairs using RewardAgent and train an LLM with the DPO objective, achieving superior performance on various NLP benchmarks compared to conventional reward models. Our codes are publicly released to facilitate further research (https://github.com/THU-KEG/Agentic-Reward-Modeling).

Abstract: Industrial robots are widely used in diverse manufacturing environments. Nonetheless, how to enable robots to automatically plan trajectories for changing tasks presents a considerable challenge. Further complexities arise when robots operate within work cells alongside machines, humans, or other robots. This paper introduces a multi-level hybrid robot motion planning method combining a task space Reinforcement Learning-based Learning from Demonstration (RL-LfD) agent and a joint-space based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based agent. A higher level agent learns to switch between the two agents to enable feasible and smooth motion. The feasibility is computed by incorporating reachability, joint limits, manipulability, and collision risks of the robot in the given environment. Therefore, the derived hybrid motion planning policy generates a feasible trajectory that adheres to task constraints. The effectiveness of the method is validated through sim ulated robotic scenarios and in a real-world setup.

Abstract: Understanding domain-specific theorems often requires more than just text-based reasoning; effective communication through structured visual explanations is crucial for deeper comprehension. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in text-based theorem reasoning, their ability to generate coherent and pedagogically meaningful visual explanations remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce TheoremExplainAgent, an agentic approach for generating long-form theorem explanation videos (over 5 minutes) using Manim animations. To systematically evaluate multimodal theorem explanations, we propose TheoremExplainBench, a benchmark covering 240 theorems across multiple STEM disciplines, along with 5 automated evaluation metrics. Our results reveal that agentic planning is essential for generating detailed long-form videos, and the o3-mini agent achieves a success rate of 93.8% and an overall score of 0.77. However, our quantitative and qualitative studies show that most of the videos produced exhibit minor issues with visual element layout. Furthermore, multimodal explanations expose deeper reasoning flaws that text-based explanations fail to reveal, highlighting the importance of multimodal explanations.

本文关注语言模型（Language Models）在加速科学发现中的潜力，强调了对其反驳错误解决方案能力进行评估和提升的重要性。当前的LM基准测试主要关注于它们生成解决方案的能力，而非挑战错误解决方案的能力。作者提出发展新的基准测试来衡量这种逆向能力，并以算法问题解决领域为例，引入了一个名为REFUTE的动态更新基准测试集，该集合包含了编程竞赛中人类专家已识别出错误解的问题及对应反例。研究分析显示，即使是最优的推理代理——OpenAI o3-mini（高），在具有代码执行反馈的情况下，也只能为REFUTE中不足9%的错误解决方案创建反例，尽管其评级表明它能从零开始解决高达48%的这些问题。作者希望通过这项工作激发对提升LM反驳错误解决方案能力的研究与进步，这一能力对于加速科学研究以及使模型通过可靠的反思性推理实现自我改进至关重要。 <div>

Abstract: There is growing excitement about the potential of Language Models (LMs) to accelerate scientific discovery. Falsifying hypotheses is key to scientific progress, as it allows claims to be iteratively refined over time. This process requires significant researcher effort, reasoning, and ingenuity. Yet current benchmarks for LMs predominantly assess their ability to generate solutions rather than challenge them. We advocate for developing benchmarks that evaluate this inverse capability - creating counterexamples for subtly incorrect solutions. To demonstrate this approach, we start with the domain of algorithmic problem solving, where counterexamples can be evaluated automatically using code execution. Specifically, we introduce REFUTE, a dynamically updating benchmark that includes recent problems and incorrect submissions from programming competitions, where human experts successfully identified counterexamples. Our analysis finds that the best reasoning agents, even OpenAI o3-mini (high) with code execution feedback, can create counterexamples for only <9% of incorrect solutions in REFUTE, even though ratings indicate its ability to solve up to 48% of these problems from scratch. We hope our work spurs progress in evaluating and enhancing LMs' ability to falsify incorrect solutions - a capability that is crucial for both accelerating research and making models self-improve through reliable reflective reasoning.

本文研究了Q-learning在一类广义Braess悖论游戏中的动态行为。这些游戏代表了一种网络路由游戏中，其中阶段游戏的纳什均衡并不构成社会最优解。文章详细分析了具有不同参数和学习率的Q-learning的收敛性，并观察到了多种现象，大致分为两种情况：要么稳定在纳什均衡，要么以类似于“埃奇沃思周期”的方式持续循环（即从纳什均衡突然跃迁到社交最优，然后逐渐恶化回纳什均衡）。此外，作者揭示了一个重要的激励不相容性问题，即当考虑设计各自Q-learner的参与者之间的元博弈时，纳什均衡点特征为异质参数，导致结果仅达到纳什均衡层面的合作，几乎没有超越这一点。最后，文中提出了对监管和合谋的新视角，并讨论了研究结果对伯特兰寡头定价博弈的影响。 <div>

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of Q-learning in a class of generalized Braess paradox games. These games represent an important class of network routing games where the associated stage-game Nash equilibria do not constitute social optima. We provide a full convergence analysis of Q-learning with varying parameters and learning rates. A wide range of phenomena emerges, broadly either settling into Nash or cycling continuously in ways reminiscent of "Edgeworth cycles" (i.e. jumping suddenly from Nash toward social optimum and then deteriorating gradually back to Nash). Our results reveal an important incentive incompatibility when thinking in terms of a meta-game being played by the designers of the individual Q-learners who set their agents' parameters. Indeed, Nash equilibria of the meta-game are characterized by heterogeneous parameters, and resulting outcomes achieve little to no cooperation beyond Nash. In conclusion, we suggest a novel perspective for thinking about regulation and collusion, and discuss the implications of our results for Bertrand oligopoly pricing games.

Abstract: We use the Chu construction to functorially build BV-categories from duoidal categories, demonstrating that candidate models of BV-logic can be cofreely constructed from a fragment of a model of Retor\'e's sequencing operator. By using this construction to show that the strong Hyland envelope is a BV-category, we find a way to build a canonical model of spatio-temporal relationships between agents in spacetime from any symmetric monoidal category. The concrete physical interpretation of spacetime events in this model as intervention-context pairs resolves deficiencies in previous attempts to give a general categorical semantics to quantum supermaps.

Abstract: In online markets, agents often learn from other's actions in addition to their private information. Such observational learning can lead to herding or information cascades in which agents eventually ignore their private information and "follow the crowd". Models for such cascades have been well studied for Bayes-rational agents that arrive sequentially and choose pay-off optimal actions. This paper additionally considers the presence of fake agents that take a fixed action in order to influence subsequent rational agents towards their preferred action. We characterize how the fraction of such fake agents impacts the behavior of rational agents given a fixed quality of private information. Our model results in a Markov chain with a countably infinite state space, for which we give an iterative method to compute an agent's chances of herding and its welfare (expected pay-off). Our main result shows a counter-intuitive phenomenon: there exist infinitely many scenarios where an increase in the fraction of fake agents in fact reduces the chances of their preferred outcome. Moreover, this increase causes a significant improvement in the welfare of every rational agent. Hence, this increase is not only counter-productive for the fake agents but is also beneficial to the rational agents.

Abstract: Gale and Shapley introduced a matching problem between two sets of agents where each agent on one side has an exogenous preference ordering over the agents on the other side. They defined a matching as stable if no unmatched pair can both improve their utility by forming a new pair. They proved, algorithmically, the existence of a stable matching. Shapley and Shubik, Demange and Gale, and many others extended the model by allowing monetary transfers. We offer a further extension by assuming that matched couples obtain their payoff endogenously as the outcome of a strategic game they have to play in a usual non-cooperative sense (without commitment) or in a semi-cooperative way (with commitment, as the outcome of a bilateral binding contract in which each player is responsible for her part of the contract). Depending on whether the players can commit or not, we define in each case a solution concept that combines Gale-Shapley pairwise stability with a (generalized) Nash equilibrium stability. In each case we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the set of solutions to be non-empty and provide an algorithm to compute a solution.

Abstract: Classical logics for strategic reasoning, such as Coalition Logic and Alternating-time Temporal Logic, formalize absolute strategic reasoning about the unconditional strategic abilities of agents to achieve their goals. Goranko and Ju, in two recent papers, introduced a Logic for Conditional Strategic Reasoning (CSR). However, its completeness is still an open problem. CSR has three featured operators, and one of them has the following reading: For some action of A that guarantees the achievement of her goal, B has an action to guarantee the achievement of his goal. This operator makes good sense when A is cooperating with B. The logic about this operator is called Logic for Cooperating Conditional Strategic Reasoning (CCSR). In this paper, we prove the completeness of two fragments of CCSR: the liability fragment and the ability fragment. The key ingredients of our proof approach include standard disjunctions, the validity-reduction condition of standard disjunctions, abstract game forms, and their realization, and the derivability-reduction condition of standard disjunctions. The approach has good potential to be applied to the completeness of CSR and other strategic logics.

Abstract: Decentralized training enables learning with distributed datasets generated at different locations without relying on a central server. In realistic scenarios, the data distribution across these sparsely connected learning agents can be significantly heterogeneous, leading to local model over-fitting and poor global model generalization. Another challenge is the high communication cost of training models in such a peer-to-peer fashion without any central coordination. In this paper, we jointly tackle these two-fold practical challenges by proposing SADDLe, a set of sharpness-aware decentralized deep learning algorithms. SADDLe leverages Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to seek a flatter loss landscape during training, resulting in better model generalization as well as enhanced robustness to communication compression. We present two versions of our approach and conduct extensive experiments to show that SADDLe leads to 1-20% improvement in test accuracy compared to other existing techniques. Additionally, our proposed approach is robust to communication compression, with an average drop of only 1% in the presence of up to 4x compression.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems must learn to communicate and understand interactions between agents to achieve cooperative goals in partially observed tasks. However, existing approaches lack a dynamic directed communication mechanism and rely on global states, thus diminishing the role of communication in centralized training. Thus, we propose the Transformer-based graph coarsening network (TGCNet), a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm. TGCNet learns the topological structure of a dynamic directed graph to represent the communication policy and integrates graph coarsening networks to approximate the representation of global state during training. It also utilizes the Transformer decoder for feature extraction during execution. Experiments on multiple cooperative MARL benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to popular MARL algorithms. Further ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our dynamic directed graph communication mechanism and graph coarsening networks.

Abstract: Learning collaborative behaviors is essential for multi-agent systems. Traditionally, multi-agent reinforcement learning solves this implicitly through a joint reward and centralized observations, assuming collaborative behavior will emerge. Other studies propose to learn from demonstrations of a group of collaborative experts. Instead, we propose an efficient and explicit way of learning collaborative behaviors in multi-agent systems by leveraging expertise from only a single human. Our insight is that humans can naturally take on various roles in a team. We show that agents can effectively learn to collaborate by allowing a human operator to dynamically switch between controlling agents for a short period and incorporating a human-like theory-of-mind model of teammates. Our experiments showed that our method improves the success rate of a challenging collaborative hide-and-seek task by up to 58% with only 40 minutes of human guidance. We further demonstrate our findings transfer to the real world by conducting multi-robot experiments.

Abstract: We introduce ColaCare, a framework that enhances Electronic Health Record (EHR) modeling through multi-agent collaboration driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach seamlessly integrates domain-specific expert models with LLMs to bridge the gap between structured EHR data and text-based reasoning. Inspired by the Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) approach used in clinical settings, ColaCare employs two types of agents: DoctorAgents and a MetaAgent, which collaboratively analyze patient data. Expert models process and generate predictions from numerical EHR data, while LLM agents produce reasoning references and decision-making reports within the MDT-driven collaborative consultation framework. The MetaAgent orchestrates the discussion, facilitating consultations and evidence-based debates among DoctorAgents, simulating diverse expertise in clinical decision-making. We additionally incorporate the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy (MSD) medical guideline within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for medical evidence support, addressing the challenge of knowledge currency. Extensive experiments conducted on three EHR datasets demonstrate ColaCare's superior performance in clinical mortality outcome and readmission prediction tasks, underscoring its potential to revolutionize clinical decision support systems and advance personalized precision medicine.

总结:<br />
本文探讨了利用强化学习(RL)替代传统模型预测控制方法在空中风能(AWE)系统中的应用。传统方法依赖于特定模型，而在不可预测的湍流大气边界层条件下难以适应。研究发现，通过RL训练的AWE系统代理能够在复杂模拟环境中有效地从湍流中提取能量，并且仅依靠风筝相对于风向和速度的局部信息即可实现这一目标。这表明RL方法对于具有模型不确定性的问题有较强的鲁棒性。 <div>

Abstract: Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) is an emerging technology designed to harness the power of high-altitude winds, offering a solution to several limitations of conventional wind turbines. AWE is based on flying devices (usually gliders or kites) that, tethered to a ground station and driven by the wind, convert its mechanical energy into electrical energy by means of a generator. Such systems are usually controlled by manoeuvering the kite so as to follow a predefined path prescribed by optimal control techniques, such as model-predictive control. These methods are strongly dependent on the specific model at use and difficult to generalize, especially in unpredictable conditions such as the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer. Our aim is to explore the possibility of replacing these techniques with an approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional methods, RL does not require a predefined model, making it robust to variability and uncertainty. Our experimental results in complex simulated environments demonstrate that AWE agents trained with RL can effectively extract energy from turbulent flows, relying on minimal local information about the kite orientation and speed relative to the wind.

Abstract: Chatter on social media is 20% bots and 80% humans. Chatter by bots and humans is consistently different: bots tend to use linguistic cues that can be easily automated while humans use cues that require dialogue understanding. Bots use words that match the identities they choose to present, while humans may send messages that are not related to the identities they present. Bots and humans differ in their communication structure: sampled bots have a star interaction structure, while sampled humans have a hierarchical structure. These conclusions are based on a large-scale analysis of social media tweets across ~200mil users across 7 events. Social media bots took the world by storm when social-cybersecurity researchers realized that social media users not only consisted of humans but also of artificial agents called bots. These bots wreck havoc online by spreading disinformation and manipulating narratives. Most research on bots are based on special-purposed definitions, mostly predicated on the event studied. This article first begins by asking, "What is a bot?", and we study the underlying principles of how bots are different from humans. We develop a first-principle definition of a social media bot. With this definition as a premise, we systematically compare characteristics between bots and humans across global events, and reflect on how the software-programmed bot is an Artificial Intelligent algorithm, and its potential for evolution as technology advances. Based on our results, we provide recommendations for the use and regulation of bots. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions: Detect, to systematically identify these automated and potentially evolving bots; Differentiate, to evaluate the goodness of the bot in terms of their content postings and relationship interactions; Disrupt, to moderate the impact of malicious bots.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in decision-making and reasoning, particularly when integrated with various tools to effectively solve complex problems. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' tool usage face several limitations: (1) limited evaluation scenarios, often lacking assessments in real multi-turn dialogue contexts; (2) narrow evaluation dimensions, with insufficient detailed assessments of how LLMs use tools; and (3) reliance on LLMs or real API executions for evaluation, which introduces significant overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce ACEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing tool usage in LLMs. ACEBench categorizes data into three primary types based on evaluation methodology: Normal, Special, and Agent. "Normal" evaluates tool usage in basic scenarios; "Special" evaluates tool usage in situations with ambiguous or incomplete instructions; "Agent" evaluates tool usage through multi-agent interactions to simulate real-world, multi-turn dialogues. We conducted extensive experiments using ACEBench, analyzing various LLMs in-depth and providing a more granular examination of error causes across different data types.

Abstract: In imitation learning for robotic manipulation, decomposing object manipulation tasks into sub-tasks enables the reuse of learned skills and the combination of learned behaviors to perform novel tasks, rather than simply replicating demonstrated motions. Human gaze is closely linked to hand movements during object manipulation. We hypothesize that an imitating agent's gaze control, fixating on specific landmarks and transitioning between them, simultaneously segments demonstrated manipulations into sub-tasks. This study proposes a simple yet robust task decomposition method based on gaze transitions. Using teleoperation, a common modality in robotic manipulation for collecting demonstrations, in which a human operator's gaze is measured and used for task decomposition as a substitute for an imitating agent's gaze. Our approach ensures consistent task decomposition across all demonstrations for each task, which is desirable in contexts such as machine learning. We evaluated the method across demonstrations of various tasks, assessing the characteristics and consistency of the resulting sub-tasks. Furthermore, extensive testing across different hyperparameter settings confirmed its robustness, making it adaptable to diverse robotic systems.

Abstract: Learning quantum states is a crucial task for realizing quantum information technology. Recently, neural approaches have emerged as promising methods for learning quantum states. We propose a meta-learning model that utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the process of learning quantum states. To improve the data efficiency of the RL, we introduce an action repetition strategy inspired by curriculum learning. The RL agent significantly improves the sample efficiency of learning random quantum states, and achieves infidelity scaling close to the Heisenberg limit. We also show that the RL agent trained using 3-qubit states can generalize to learning up to 5-qubit states. These results highlight the utility of RL-driven meta-learning to enhance the efficiency and generalizability of learning quantum states. Our approach can be applied to improve quantum control, quantum optimization, and quantum machine learning.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative AI has catalyzed the emergence of autonomous AI agents, presenting unprecedented challenges for enterprise computing infrastructures. Current enterprise API architectures are predominantly designed for human-driven, predefined interaction patterns, rendering them ill-equipped to support intelligent agents' dynamic, goal-oriented behaviors. This research systematically examines the architectural adaptations for enterprise APIs to support AI agentic workflows effectively. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing API design paradigms, agent interaction models, and emerging technological constraints, the paper develops a strategic framework for API transformation. The study employs a mixed-method approach, combining theoretical modeling, comparative analysis, and exploratory design principles to address critical challenges in standardization, performance, and intelligent interaction. The proposed research contributes a conceptual model for next-generation enterprise APIs that can seamlessly integrate with autonomous AI agent ecosystems, offering significant implications for future enterprise computing architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential to accelerate drug discovery. However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for an autonomous agent to map an unknown scalar field in GPS-denied regions. To reduce localization errors, the agent alternates between GPS-enabled and GPS-denied areas while collecting measurements. User-defined error bounds determine the dwell time in each region. A switching trajectory is then designed to ensure field measurements in GPS-denied regions remain within the specified error limits. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis guarantees bounded error trajectories while tracking the desired path. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through simulations, with an error analysis comparing the GP-predicted scalar field model to the actual field.

Abstract: The orchestration of agents to optimize a collective objective without centralized control is challenging yet crucial for applications such as controlling autonomous fleets, and surveillance and reconnaissance using sensor networks. Decentralized controller design has been inspired by self-organization found in nature, with a prominent source of inspiration being flocking; however, decentralized controllers struggle to maintain flock cohesion. The graph neural network (GNN) architecture has emerged as an indispensable machine learning tool for developing decentralized controllers capable of maintaining flock cohesion, but they fail to exploit the symmetries present in flocking dynamics, hindering their generalizability. We enforce rotation equivariance and translation invariance symmetries in decentralized flocking GNN controllers and achieve comparable flocking control with 70% less training data and 75% fewer trainable weights than existing GNN controllers without these symmetries enforced. We also show that our symmetry-aware controller generalizes better than existing GNN controllers.

arXiv:2502.17618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Successful collaboration requires team members to stay aligned, especially in complex sequential tasks. Team members must dynamically coordinate which subtasks to perform and in what order. However, real-world constraints like partial observability and limited communication bandwidth often lead to suboptimal collaboration. Even among expert teams, the same task can be executed in multiple ways. To develop multi-agent systems and human-AI teams for such tasks, we are interested in data-driven learning of multimodal team behaviors. Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) provides a promising framework for data-driven learning of team behavior from demonstrations, but existing methods struggle with heterogeneous demonstrations, as they assume that all demonstrations originate from a single team policy. Hence, in this work, we introduce DTIL: a hierarchical MAIL algorithm designed to learn multimodal team behaviors in complex sequential tasks. DTIL represents each team member with a hierarchical policy and learns these policies from heterogeneous team demonstrations in a factored manner. By employing a distribution-matching approach, DTIL mitigates compounding errors and scales effectively to long horizons and continuous state representations. Experimental results show that DTIL outperforms MAIL baselines and accurately models team behavior across a variety of collaborative scenarios.

本文提出了一种基于视觉-语言模型（VLM）的多智能体框架——METAL，用于有效自动图表生成。该任务需要将期望的视觉属性精确地编码到代码中，既要求强大的视觉设计技能又需要精确的编程能力，这对直接提示VLM构成挑战。METAL通过将图表生成任务分解为多个专业智能体之间的迭代协作来解决这一问题。相较于现有最佳结果，METAL在图表生成任务上准确度提升了5.2%。此外，METAL框架还表现出测试时间扩展现象，即随着计算预算从512增长到8192个令牌，其性能呈单调上升趋势。最后，研究发现，在METAL的批判过程中分离不同模态可以增强VLM在多模态语境下的自我修正能力。 <div>

Abstract: Chart generation aims to generate code to produce charts satisfying the desired visual properties, e.g., texts, layout, color, and type. It has great potential to empower the automatic professional report generation in financial analysis, research presentation, education, and healthcare. In this work, we build a vision-language model (VLM) based multi-agent framework for effective automatic chart generation. Generating high-quality charts requires both strong visual design skills and precise coding capabilities that embed the desired visual properties into code. Such a complex multi-modal reasoning process is difficult for direct prompting of VLMs. To resolve these challenges, we propose METAL, a multi-agent framework that decomposes the task of chart generation into the iterative collaboration among specialized agents. METAL achieves 5.2% improvement in accuracy over the current best result in the chart generation task. The METAL framework exhibits the phenomenon of test-time scaling: its performance increases monotonically as the logarithmic computational budget grows from 512 to 8192 tokens. In addition, we find that separating different modalities during the critique process of METAL boosts the self-correction capability of VLMs in the multimodal context.

总结:
本文关注了由多个相互作用组件（如LLM代理和外部工具）组成的复合AI系统的对齐问题，这些系统在各种任务中展现出最先进的结果。由于组件间的非微分交互以及系统层面的偏好无法直接转化为组件层面的偏好，使得传统的DPO方法不适用于此类系统。为解决这些问题，文章提出了将复合AI系统建模为有向无环图(DAG)，并设计了一个系统级的DPO (SysDPO) 方法，使其能在这些DAG上适应性地进行联合对齐操作。通过研究LLM和扩散模型的联合对齐案例，作者证明了其方法的有效性。这项工作对于复合AI系统的对齐研究提供了新的见解，并为其未来的发展奠定了基础。<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Compound AI systems, comprising multiple interacting components such as LLM agents and external tools, demonstrate state-of-the-art results across diverse tasks. It is hence crucial to align components within the system to produce consistent results that match human expectations. However, conventional alignment methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), are not directly applicable to compound AI systems. These challenges include the non-differentiable interactions between components, making end-to-end gradient optimization infeasible. Additionally, system-level preferences cannot be directly translated into component-level preferences, further complicating alignment. We address the issues by formulating compound AI systems as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), capturing the connections between agents and the data generation processes. We propose a system-level DPO (SysDPO) to jointly align compound systems by adapting the DPO to operate on these DAGs. We study the joint alignment of an LLM and a diffusion model to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our exploration provides insights into the alignment of compound AI systems and lays a foundation for future advancements.

总结:
本文探讨了使用强化学习训练神经网络以辅助公共交通网络设计的方法。研究主要关注公交网络设计问题（TNDP），这是一个具有实际重要性的优化问题。与传统采用元启发式算法（如遗传算法和蚁群优化）不同，文中采用了强化学习的方法，将构建公交路线集的问题建模为马尔科夫决策过程（MDP），并通过训练神经网络策略作为该MDP中的智能体。进一步地，研究表明这个经过强化学习训练的神经网络策略不仅可以直接用于规划公交网络，还可以与现有的元启发式算法结合，既用于初始化解决方案，也可在搜索解空间的过程中提出有潜力的操作建议。通过这种混合算法，利用经强化学习训练的神经策略作为经典元启发式框架的核心组件，可以规划出优于单一神经策略或元启发式算法的公交网络。文章通过重新设计加拿大魁北克省拉瓦尔市的公交网络并进行模拟验证，结果显示，由此产生的公交网络能提供更好的服务且成本更低。 <div>

Abstract: This thesis concerns the use of reinforcement learning to train neural networks to aid in the design of public transit networks. The Transit Network Design Problem (TNDP) is an optimization problem of considerable practical importance. Given a city with an existing road network and travel demands, the goal is to find a set of transit routes - each of which is a path through the graph - that collectively satisfy all demands, while minimizing a cost function that may depend both on passenger satisfaction and operating costs. The existing literature on this problem mainly considers metaheuristic optimization algorithms, such as genetic algorithms and ant-colony optimization. By contrast, we begin by taking a reinforcement learning approach, formulating the construction of a set of transit routes as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and training a neural net policy to act as the agent in this MDP. We then show that, beyond using this policy to plan a transit network directly, it can be combined with existing metaheuristic algorithms, both to initialize the solution and to suggest promising moves at each step of a search through solution space. We find that such hybrid algorithms, which use a neural policy trained via reinforcement learning as a core component within a classical metaheuristic framework, can plan transit networks that are superior to those planned by either the neural policy or the metaheuristic algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to redesign the transit network for the city of Laval, Quebec, and show that in simulation, the resulting transit network provides better service at lower cost than the existing transit network.

<div> 关键词：信息结构、机制设计、多维度、信息披露、物品定价

总结:
本文探讨了在机制设计中，当信息结构可由设计师影响时，简单机制的竞争优势。研究内容是对Bergemann和Pesendorfer（2007）提出的单维模型的多维度推广，其中设计师可以通过信息披露来塑造信息结构。文章聚焦于一个多商品销售问题，卖方需要向有单位需求的买方出售m件商品以最大化其收入，买方对各商品的价值可能存在任意相关性。主要结果表明，通过适当选择信息披露方案，采用物品定价策略（即对每件商品设定一口价）可以实现高度竞争力，保证至少获得最优收益的50.1%。这是首次在不假设买方价值分布的前提下，证明在这样的多维度场景中，简单机制具有（近似）最优性的结果。这一发现不仅展示了信息披露如何提升简单机制的性能，还为重新评估多维度环境中简单机制的有效性提供了一个新框架。 <div>

Abstract: In classical mechanism design, the prevailing assumption is that the information structure about agents' types is exogenous. This assumption introduces complexity, especially with multi-dimensional agent types, leading to mechanisms that, while optimal, may appear complex and unnatural. Furthermore, Hart and Nisan (2019) show that the gap between the performance of any simple mechanism and the optimal solution could be potentially unbounded. We challenge this conventional view by showing that simple mechanisms can be highly competitive if the information structure is endogenous and can be influenced by the designer.
  We study a multi-dimensional generalization of a single-dimensional model proposed by Bergemann and Pesendorfer (2007), where the designer can shape the information structure via information disclosure. Specifically, we consider a fundamental multi-dimensional mechanism design problem, where a seller is selling m items to a single unit-demand buyer to maximize her revenue. The buyer's values can be arbitrarily correlated across the items. Our main result shows that, following an appropriately chosen information disclosure scheme, item pricing, i.e., set a take-it-or-leave-it price on each item is highly competitive and guarantees to attain at least 50.1% of the optimal revenue. To our knowledge, this is the first result demonstrating the (approximate) optimality of simple mechanisms in this extensively studied multi-dimensional setting, without making any assumptions about the buyer's value distribution. We believe our result not only demonstrates the power of information disclosure in enhancing the performance of simple mechanisms but also suggests a new framework for reevaluating their efficacy in multi-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Safe navigation is essential for autonomous systems operating in hazardous environments. Traditional planning methods excel at long-horizon tasks but rely on a predefined graph with fixed distance metrics. In contrast, safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors without relying on manual heuristics but fails to solve long-horizon tasks, particularly in goal-conditioned and multi-agent scenarios.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel method that integrates the strengths of both planning and safe RL. Our method leverages goal-conditioned RL and safe RL to learn a goal-conditioned policy for navigation while concurrently estimating cumulative distance and safety levels using learned value functions via an automated self-training algorithm. By constructing a graph with states from the replay buffer, our method prunes unsafe edges and generates a waypoint-based plan that the agent follows until reaching its goal, effectively balancing faster and safer routes over extended distances.
  Utilizing this unified high-level graph and a shared low-level goal-conditioned safe RL policy, we extend this approach to address the multi-agent safe navigation problem. In particular, we leverage Conflict-Based Search (CBS) to create waypoint-based plans for multiple agents allowing for their safe navigation over extended horizons. This integration enhances the scalability of goal-conditioned safe RL in multi-agent scenarios, enabling efficient coordination among agents.
  Extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in achieving distance goals safely for multiple agents in complex and hazardous environments. Our code will be released to support future research.

Abstract: Multi-modality learning has become a crucial technique for improving the performance of machine learning applications across domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and perception systems. While existing frameworks such as Auxiliary Modality Learning (AML) effectively utilize multiple data sources during training and enable inference with reduced modalities, they primarily operate in a single-agent context. This limitation is particularly critical in dynamic environments, such as connected autonomous vehicles (CAV), where incomplete data coverage can lead to decision-making blind spots. To address these challenges, we propose Collaborative Auxiliary Modality Learning ($\textbf{CAML}$), a novel multi-agent multi-modality framework that enables agents to collaborate and share multimodal data during training while allowing inference with reduced modalities per agent during testing. We systematically analyze the effectiveness of $\textbf{CAML}$ from the perspective of uncertainty reduction and data coverage, providing theoretical insights into its advantages over AML. Experimental results in collaborative decision-making for CAV in accident-prone scenarios demonstrate that \ours~achieves up to a ${\bf 58.13}\%$ improvement in accident detection. Additionally, we validate $\textbf{CAML}$ on real-world aerial-ground robot data for collaborative semantic segmentation, achieving up to a ${\bf 10.61}\%$ improvement in mIoU.

Abstract: Previous research has shown that humans are more receptive towards language models that that exhibit empathetic behavior. While empathy is essential for developing helpful dialogue agents, very few large corpora containing empathetic dialogues are available for fine-tune LLMs. The few existing corpora have largely relied on crowdsourcing to simulate empathetic conversations, a process that is expensive, time-consuming, and not scalable to larger datasets. We propose a data generation framework for developing SYNTHEMPATHY, a large corpus containing 105k empathetic responses to real-life situations compiled through LLM generation. A base Mistral 7B model fine-tuned on our SYNTHEMPATHY corpus exhibits an increase in the average empathy score.

Abstract: We propose a new model for aggregating preferences over a set of indivisible items based on a quantile value. In this model, each agent is endowed with a specific quantile, and the value of a given bundle is defined by the corresponding quantile of the individual values of the items within it. Our model captures the diverse ways in which agents may perceive a bundle, even when they agree on the values of individual items. It enables richer behavioral modeling that cannot be easily captured by additive valuation functions. We study the problem of maximizing utilitarian and egalitarian welfare within the quantile-based valuation setting. For each of the welfare functions, we analyze the complexity of the objectives. Interestingly, our results show that the complexity of both objectives varies significantly depending on whether the allocation is required to be balanced. We provide near-optimal approximation algorithms for utilitarian welfare, and for egalitarian welfare, we present exact algorithms whenever possible.

Abstract: LLM-based Interactive Drama is a novel AI-based dialogue scenario, where the user (i.e. the player) plays the role of a character in the story, has conversations with characters played by LLM agents, and experiences an unfolding story. This paper begins with understanding interactive drama from two aspects: Immersion, the player's feeling of being present in the story, and Agency, the player's ability to influence the story world. Both are crucial to creating an enjoyable interactive experience, while they have been underexplored in previous work. To enhance these two aspects, we first propose Playwriting-guided Generation, a novel method that helps LLMs craft dramatic stories with substantially improved structures and narrative quality. Additionally, we introduce Plot-based Reflection for LLM agents to refine their reactions to align with the player's intentions. Our evaluation relies on human judgment to assess the gains of our methods in terms of immersion and agency.

Abstract: Improvements in the area of large language models have shifted towards the construction of models capable of using external tools and interpreting their outputs. These so-called web agents have the ability to interact autonomously with the internet. This allows them to become powerful daily assistants handling time-consuming, repetitive tasks while supporting users in their daily activities. While web agent research is thriving, the sustainability aspect of this research direction remains largely unexplored. We provide an initial exploration of the energy and CO2 cost associated with web agents. Our results show how different philosophies in web agent creation can severely impact the associated expended energy. We highlight lacking transparency regarding the disclosure of model parameters and processes used for some web agents as a limiting factor when estimating energy consumption. As such, our work advocates a change in thinking when evaluating web agents, warranting dedicated metrics for energy consumption and sustainability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the fact-checking studies. However, existing automated fact-checking evaluation methods rely on static datasets and classification metrics, which fail to automatically evaluate the justification production and uncover the nuanced limitations of LLMs in fact-checking. In this work, we introduce FACT-AUDIT, an agent-driven framework that adaptively and dynamically assesses LLMs' fact-checking capabilities. Leveraging importance sampling principles and multi-agent collaboration, FACT-AUDIT generates adaptive and scalable datasets, performs iterative model-centric evaluations, and updates assessments based on model-specific responses. By incorporating justification production alongside verdict prediction, this framework provides a comprehensive and evolving audit of LLMs' factual reasoning capabilities, to investigate their trustworthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FACT-AUDIT effectively differentiates among state-of-the-art LLMs, providing valuable insights into model strengths and limitations in model-centric fact-checking analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models have garnered significant attention for their capabilities in multilingual natural language processing, while studies on risks associated with cross biases are limited to immediate context preferences. Cross-language disparities in reasoning-based recommendations remain largely unexplored, with a lack of even descriptive analysis. This study is the first to address this gap. We test LLM's applicability and capability in providing personalized advice across three key scenarios: university applications, travel, and relocation. We investigate multilingual bias in state-of-the-art LLMs by analyzing their responses to decision-making tasks across multiple languages. We quantify bias in model-generated scores and assess the impact of demographic factors and reasoning strategies (e.g., Chain-of-Thought prompting) on bias patterns. Our findings reveal that local language bias is prevalent across different tasks, with GPT-4 and Sonnet reducing bias for English-speaking countries compared to GPT-3.5 but failing to achieve robust multilingual alignment, highlighting broader implications for multilingual AI agents and applications such as education.

Abstract: Multi-drone systems have become transformative technologies across various industries, offering innovative applications. However, despite significant advancements, their autonomous capabilities remain inherently limited. As a result, human operators are often essential for supervising and controlling these systems, creating what is referred to as a human-multi-drone team. In realistic settings, human operators must make real-time decisions while addressing a variety of signals, such as drone statuses and sensor readings, and adapting to dynamic conditions and uncertainty. This complexity may lead to suboptimal operations, potentially compromising the overall effectiveness of the team. In critical contexts like Search And Rescue (SAR) missions, such inefficiencies can have costly consequences. This work introduces an advising agent designed to enhance collaboration in human-multi-drone teams, with a specific focus on SAR scenarios. The advising agent is designed to assist the human operator by suggesting contextual actions worth taking. To that end, the agent employs a novel computation technique that relies on a small set of human demonstrations to generate varying realistic human-like trajectories. These trajectories are then generalized using machine learning for fast and accurate predictions of the long-term effects of different advice. Through human evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach delivers high-quality assistance, resulting in significantly improved performance compared to baseline conditions.

However, we know little about the impact of generative AI on collective creativity. This study investigates how human-AI interactions shape collective creativity within experimental social networks. We conducted large-scale online experiments with 879 participants and AI agents in a creative writing task. Participants (either humans or AI) joined 5x5 grid-based networks, and were asked to iteratively select, modify, and share stories. Initially, AI-only networks showed greater creativity (rated by a separate group of 94 human raters) and diversity than human-only and human-AI networks. However, over time, hybrid human-AI networks became more diverse in their creations than AI-only networks. In part, this is because AI agents retained little from the original stories, while human-only networks preserved continuity. These findings highlight the value of experimental social networks in understanding human-AI hybrid societies.

<div> 关键词：大型语言模型、数值推理、Agent Trading Arena、几何推理、反射模块

<br /><br />总结:

本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在动态任务中的泛化能力，特别是在数值推理方面的表现。研究者设计了一个名为Agent Trading Arena的虚拟经济系统游戏，通过零和博弈让代理进行股票投资，以此来评估LLM处理文本股票数据的能力。实验发现，LLMs在处理纯文本股票数据时对代数推理有困难，倾向于关注局部细节而非全局趋势。然而，当呈现视觉数据，如散点图或K线图表时，LLMs在几何推理方面表现出色，表明视觉表示能够增强数值推理能力。进一步地，引入反射模块可以提升LLMs分析和解释复杂数据的能力。该研究使用NASDAQ股票数据集验证了这些发现，结果表明LLMs在处理视觉数据时相比文本数据展现出更强的推理能力。相关代码和数据已在https://github.com/wekjsdvnm/Agent-Trading-Arena.git上公开。 <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved performance in natural language processing tasks. However, their ability to generalize to dynamic, unseen tasks, particularly in numerical reasoning, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks mainly evaluate LLMs on problems with predefined optimal solutions, which may not align with real-world scenarios where clear answers are absent. To bridge this gap, we design the Agent Trading Arena, a virtual numerical game simulating complex economic systems through zero-sum games, where agents invest in stock portfolios. Our experiments reveal that LLMs, including GPT-4o, struggle with algebraic reasoning when dealing with plain-text stock data, often focusing on local details rather than global trends. In contrast, LLMs perform significantly better with geometric reasoning when presented with visual data, such as scatter plots or K-line charts, suggesting that visual representations enhance numerical reasoning. This capability is further improved by incorporating the reflection module, which aids in the analysis and interpretation of complex data. We validate our findings on NASDAQ Stock dataset, where LLMs demonstrate stronger reasoning with visual data compared to text. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/wekjsdvnm/Agent-Trading-Arena.git.

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种新的数据集ViDoSeek，用于评估RAG方法处理富含视觉信息文档的能力，并指出了当前RAG方法的两个主要局限：视觉检索方法难以有效融合文本和视觉特征，以及现有方法对推理令牌的分配不足。为解决这些问题，文章提出了ViDoRAG，这是一种针对视觉文档复杂推理的新型多代理RAG框架。ViDoRAG采用基于高斯混合模型（GMM）的混合策略进行有效的多模态检索，并通过探索、摘要和反思的迭代代理工作流程来增强模型的推理能力。实验结果表明，ViDoRAG在ViDoSeek基准测试上相比于现有方法性能提升了超过10%。 <div>

Abstract: Understanding information from visually rich documents remains a significant challenge for traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods. Existing benchmarks predominantly focus on image-based question answering (QA), overlooking the fundamental challenges of efficient retrieval, comprehension, and reasoning within dense visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce ViDoSeek, a novel dataset designed to evaluate RAG performance on visually rich documents requiring complex reasoning. Based on it, we identify key limitations in current RAG approaches: (i) purely visual retrieval methods struggle to effectively integrate both textual and visual features, and (ii) previous approaches often allocate insufficient reasoning tokens, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose ViDoRAG, a novel multi-agent RAG framework tailored for complex reasoning across visual documents. ViDoRAG employs a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based hybrid strategy to effectively handle multi-modal retrieval. To further elicit the model's reasoning capabilities, we introduce an iterative agent workflow incorporating exploration, summarization, and reflection, providing a framework for investigating test-time scaling in RAG domains. Extensive experiments on ViDoSeek validate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. Notably, ViDoRAG outperforms existing methods by over 10% on the competitive ViDoSeek benchmark.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents through an environment by leveraging both language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Autonomous agents capable of diverse object manipulations should be able to acquire a wide range of manipulation skills with high reusability. Although advances in deep learning have made it increasingly feasible to replicate the dexterity of human teleoperation in robots, generalizing these acquired skills to previously unseen scenarios remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm, Gaze-based Bottleneck-aware Robot Manipulation (GazeBot), which enables high reusability of the learned motions even when the object positions and end-effector poses differ from those in the provided demonstrations. By leveraging gaze information and motion bottlenecks, both crucial features for object manipulation, GazeBot achieves high generalization performance compared with state-of-the-art imitation learning methods, without sacrificing its dexterity and reactivity. Furthermore, the training process of GazeBot is entirely data-driven once a demonstration dataset with gaze data is provided.

Abstract: The rise of echo chambers on social media platforms has heightened concerns about polarization and the reinforcement of existing beliefs. Traditional approaches for simulating echo chamber formation have often relied on predefined rules and numerical simulations, which, while insightful, may lack the nuance needed to capture complex, real-world interactions. In this paper, we present a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as generative agents to simulate echo chamber dynamics within social networks. The novelty of our approach is that it incorporates both opinion updates and network rewiring behaviors driven by LLMs, allowing for a context-aware and semantically rich simulation of social interactions. Additionally, we utilize real-world Twitter (now X) data to benchmark the LLM-based simulation against actual social media behaviors, providing insights into the accuracy and realism of the generated opinion trends. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of LLMs in modeling echo chamber formation, capturing both structural and semantic dimensions of opinion clustering. %This work contributes to a deeper understanding of social influence dynamics and offers a new tool for studying polarization in online communities.

Abstract: Recent interest in human-AI interactions in agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) has grown rapidly due to the widespread utilization of large language models (LLMs). ABMS is an intelligent approach that simulates autonomous agents' behaviors within a defined environment to research emergent phenomena. Integrating LLMs into ABMS enables natural language interaction between humans and models. Meanwhile, it introduces new challenges that rely on human interaction to address. Human involvement can assist ABMS in adapting to flexible and complex research demands. However, systematic reviews of interactions that examine how humans and AI interact in ABMS are lacking. In this paper, we investigate existing works and propose a novel taxonomy to categorize the interactions derived from them. Specifically, human users refer to researchers who utilize ABMS tools to conduct their studies in our survey. We decompose interactions into five dimensions: the goals that users want to achieve (Why), the phases that users are involved (When), the components of the system (What), the roles of users (Who), and the means of interactions (How). Our analysis summarizes the findings that reveal existing interaction patterns. They provide researchers who develop interactions with comprehensive guidance on how humans and AI interact. We further discuss the unexplored interactions and suggest future research directions.

Abstract: Advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved human motion understanding. However, these models remain constrained by their "instruct-only" nature, lacking interactivity and adaptability for diverse analytical perspectives. To address these challenges, we introduce ChatMotion, a multimodal multi-agent framework for human motion analysis. ChatMotion dynamically interprets user intent, decomposes complex tasks into meta-tasks, and activates specialized function modules for motion comprehension. It integrates multiple specialized modules, such as the MotionCore, to analyze human motion from various perspectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate ChatMotion's precision, adaptability, and user engagement for human motion understanding.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping online text-based communication; a transformation that is extensively studied as AI-mediated communication. However, much of the existing research remains bound by traditional communication models, where messages are created and transmitted directly between humans despite LLMs being able to play a more active role in transforming messages. In this work, we propose the Intersubjective Model of AI-mediated Communication, an alternative communication model that leverages LLM-based adaptive agents to augment human-human communication. Unlike traditional communication models that focus on the accurate transmission of information, the Intersubjective Model allows for communication to be designed in an adaptive and customizable way to create alternative interactions by dynamically shaping messages in real time and facilitating shared understanding between the human participants. In this paper, we have developed a prototype text chat system based on the Intersubjective Model to describe the potential of this model, as well as the design space it affords.

总结:
本文研究了在线采购拍卖问题，其中代理人随机顺序到达并拥有私人成本。买方的目标是在支付预算约束下，通过选取一组服务提供者来最大化其对应的单调子模函数价值。文章提出了一个具有常数竞争比的随机化单次定价机制，解决了(Badanidiyuru, Kleinberg 和 Singer, EC 2012)中提出的主要开放性问题。该机制通过学习并估计最优价值（OPT），根据此来决定向代理人提供的支付。主要挑战在于如何从代理人的接受/拒绝响应中以常数因子精度学习到OPT。作者的方法基于一个在线测试，用于判断估算是否过低，并设计了一个自适应搜索算法逐步细化估算值。 <div>
arXiv:2502.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider online procurement auctions, where the agents arrive sequentially, in random order, and have private costs for their services. The buyer aims to maximize a monotone submodular value function for the subset of agents whose services are procured, subject to a budget constraint on their payments. We consider a posted-price setting where upon each agent's arrival, the buyer decides on a payment offered to them. The agent accepts or rejects the offer, depending on whether the payment exceeds their cost, without revealing any other information about their private costs whatsoever. We present a randomized online posted-price mechanism with constant competitive ratio, thus resolving the main open question of (Badanidiyuru, Kleinberg and Singer, EC 2012). Posted-price mechanisms for online procurement typically operate by learning an estimation of the optimal value, denoted as OPT, and using it to determine the payments offered to the agents. The main challenge is to learn OPT within a constant factor from the agents' accept / reject responses to the payments offered. Our approach is based on an online test of whether our estimation is too low compared against OPT and a carefully designed adaptive search that gradually refines our estimation.

Abstract: Regarding problems like reduced precipitation and an increase in population, water resource scarcity has become one of the most critical problems in modern-day societies, as a consequence, there is a shortage of available water resources for irrigation in arid and semi-arid countries. On the other hand, it is possible to utilize modern technologies to control irrigation and reduce water loss. One of these technologies is the Internet of Things (IoT). Despite the possibility of using the IoT in irrigation control systems, there are complexities in designing such systems. Considering this issue, it is possible to use agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) methodologies to design complex cyber-physical systems such as IoT-based systems. In this research, a smart irrigation system is designed based on Prometheus AOSE methodology, to reduce water loss by maintaining soil moisture in a suitable interval. The designed system comprises sensors, a central agent, and irrigation nodes. These agents follow defined rules to maintain soil moisture at a desired level cooperatively. For system simulation, a hybrid agent-based and system dynamics model was designed. In this hybrid model, soil moisture dynamics were modeled based on the system dynamics approach. The proposed model, was implemented in AnyLogic computer simulation software. Utilizing the simulation model, irrigation rules were examined. The system's functionality in automatic irrigation mode was tested based on a 256-run, fractional factorial design, and the effects of important factors such as soil properties on total irrigated water and total operation time were analyzed. Based on the tests, the system consistently irrigated nearly optimal water amounts in all tests. Moreover, the results were also used to minimize the system's energy consumption by reducing the system's operational time.

Abstract: In the multi-turn interaction schema, large language models (LLMs) can leverage user feedback to enhance the quality and relevance of their responses. However, evaluating an LLM's ability to incorporate user refutation feedback is crucial yet challenging. In this study, we introduce RefuteBench 2.0, which significantly extends the original RefuteBench by incorporating LLM agents as refuters and evaluators, which allows for flexible and comprehensive assessment.
  We design both transient and persistent refutation instructions with different validity periods. Meta-evaluation shows that the LLM-based refuter could generate more human-like refutations and the evaluators could assign scores with high correlation with humans. Experimental results of various LLMs show that current models could effectively satisfy the refutation but fail to memorize the refutation information. Interestingly, we also observe that the performance of the initial task decreases as the refutations increase. Analysis of the attention scores further shows a potential weakness of current LLMs: they struggle to retain and correctly use previous information during long context dialogues. https://github.com/ElliottYan/RefuteBench-2.0

Instead of a travel itinerary, an AI Agent would book all aspects of your trip. Instead of generating text or images for social media post, an AI Agent would post the content across a host of social media outlets. The potential power of AI Agents has fueled legal scholars' fears that AI Agents will enable rogue commerce, human manipulation, rampant defamation, and intellectual property harms. These scholars are calling for regulation before AI Agents cause havoc.
  This Article addresses the concerns around AI Agents head on. It shows that core aspects of how one piece of software interacts with another creates ways to discipline AI Agents so that rogue, undesired actions are unlikely, perhaps more so than rules designed to govern human agents. It also develops a way to leverage the computer-science approach to value-alignment to improve a user's ability to take action to prevent or correct AI Agent operations. That approach offers and added benefit of helping AI Agents align with norms around user-AI Agent interactions. These practices will enable desired economic outcomes and mitigate perceived risks. The Article also argues that no matter how much AI Agents seem like human agents, they need not, and should not, be given legal personhood status. In short, humans are responsible for AI Agents' actions, and this Article provides a guide for how humans can build and maintain responsible AI Agents.

总结:
本文关注大型语言模型（LLM）基线代理在未见过的任务上的泛化能力问题。研究发现，微调奖励模型以指导策略模型比直接微调策略模型更为稳健。据此，文章提出了AgentRM，一个通用型奖励模型，用于引导策略模型进行有效的测试时搜索。文中深入探讨了构建奖励模型的三种方法，包括显式奖励建模、隐式奖励建模和LLM作为评判者。实验结果显示，AgentRM在九项不同类型的任务上平均提升了基础策略模型的表现8.8点，超越顶级通用代理4.0点，并在弱到强泛化性能上展现出更强的优势，特别是在LLaMA-3-70B策略模型上提高了12.6点。此外，AgentRM还能增强微调过的策略模型并在三个保留任务中超过顶级专用代理11.4点。进一步分析证实了其在测试时扩展的有效性。相关代码将被发布以促进该领域的研究工作。 <div>

Abstract: Existing LLM-based agents have achieved strong performance on held-in tasks, but their generalizability to unseen tasks remains poor. Hence, some recent work focus on fine-tuning the policy model with more diverse tasks to improve the generalizability. In this work, we find that finetuning a reward model to guide the policy model is more robust than directly finetuning the policy model. Based on this finding, we propose AgentRM, a generalizable reward model, to guide the policy model for effective test-time search. We comprehensively investigate three approaches to construct the reward model, including explicit reward modeling, implicit reward modeling and LLM-as-a-judge. We then use AgentRM to guide the answer generation with Best-of-N sampling and step-level beam search. On four types of nine agent tasks, AgentRM enhances the base policy model by $8.8$ points on average, surpassing the top general agent by $4.0$. Moreover, it demonstrates weak-to-strong generalization, yielding greater improvement of $12.6$ on LLaMA-3-70B policy model. As for the specializability, AgentRM can also boost a finetuned policy model and outperform the top specialized agent by $11.4$ on three held-in tasks. Further analysis verifies its effectiveness in test-time scaling. Codes will be released to facilitate the research in this area.

Abstract: A number of recent studies have focused on developing surgical simulation platforms to train machine learning (ML) agents or models with synthetic data for surgical assistance. While existing platforms excel at tasks such as rigid body manipulation and soft body deformation, they struggle to simulate more complex soft body behaviors like cutting and suturing. A key challenge lies in modeling soft body fracture and splitting using the finite-element method (FEM), which is the predominant approach in current platforms. Additionally, the two-way suture needle/thread contact inside a soft body is further complicated when using FEM. In this work, we use the material point method (MPM) for such challenging simulations and propose new rigid geometries and soft-rigid contact methods specifically designed for them. We introduce CRESSim-MPM, a GPU-accelerated MPM library that integrates multiple MPM solvers and incorporates surgical geometries for cutting and suturing, serving as a specialized physics engine for surgical applications. It is further integrated into Unity, requiring minimal modifications to existing projects for soft body simulation. We demonstrate the simulator's capabilities in real-time simulation of cutting and suturing on soft tissue and provide an initial performance evaluation of different MPM solvers when simulating varying numbers of particles.

Abstract: In this paper we present ToMCAT (Theory-of-Mind for Cooperative Agents in Teams), a new framework for generating ToM-conditioned trajectories. It combines a meta-learning mechanism, that performs ToM reasoning over teammates' underlying goals and future behavior, with a multiagent denoising-diffusion model, that generates plans for an agent and its teammates conditioned on both the agent's goals and its teammates' characteristics, as computed via ToM. We implemented an online planning system that dynamically samples new trajectories (replans) from the diffusion model whenever it detects a divergence between a previously generated plan and the current state of the world. We conducted several experiments using ToMCAT in a simulated cooking domain. Our results highlight the importance of the dynamic replanning mechanism in reducing the usage of resources without sacrificing team performance. We also show that recent observations about the world and teammates' behavior collected by an agent over the course of an episode combined with ToM inferences are crucial to generate team-aware plans for dynamic adaptation to teammates, especially when no prior information is provided about them.

总结:
本文提出了一种新的后训练范式——MAPoRL（Multi-Agent Post-co-training for collaborative LLMs with Reinforcement Learning），用于激发多智能体大型语言模型协作的能力并进一步释放其潜力。与依赖单一LLM的内在协作能力不同，MAPoRL让多个LLM独立生成响应并进行多轮讨论以共同优化最终答案。通过MAPoRL验证器对答案和讨论过程打分，同时鼓励纠正性和有说服力的讨论。该分数作为协同训练奖励，通过多智能体强化学习最大化。实验表明，单独训练单个LLM不足以产生有效的协作效果，而采用多智能体协同训练可以提升跨基准的合作性能，并具有向未见过的领域泛化的潜力。 <div>

Abstract: Leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) to build collaborative multi-agentic workflows has demonstrated significant potential. However, most previous studies focus on prompting the out-of-the-box LLMs, relying on their innate capability for collaboration, which may not improve LLMs' performance as shown recently. In this paper, we introduce a new post-training paradigm MAPoRL (Multi-Agent Post-co-training for collaborative LLMs with Reinforcement Learning), to explicitly elicit the collaborative behaviors and further unleash the power of multi-agentic LLM frameworks. In MAPoRL, multiple LLMs first generate their own responses independently and engage in a multi-turn discussion to collaboratively improve the final answer. In the end, a MAPoRL verifier evaluates both the answer and the discussion, by assigning a score that verifies the correctness of the answer, while adding incentives to encourage corrective and persuasive discussions. The score serves as the co-training reward, and is then maximized through multi-agent RL. Unlike existing LLM post-training paradigms, MAPoRL advocates the co-training of multiple LLMs together using RL for better generalization. Accompanied by analytical insights, our experiments demonstrate that training individual LLMs alone is insufficient to induce effective collaboration. In contrast, multi-agent co-training can boost the collaboration performance across benchmarks, with generalization to unseen domains.

Abstract: A properly designed controller can help improve the quality of experimental measurements or force a dynamical system to follow a completely new time-evolution path. Recent developments in deep reinforcement learning have made steep advances toward designing effective control schemes for fairly complex systems. However, a general simulation scheme that employs deep reinforcement learning for exerting control in stochastic systems is yet to be established. In this paper, we attempt to further bridge a gap between control theory and deep reinforcement learning by proposing a simulation algorithm that allows achieving control of the dynamics of stochastic systems through the use of trained artificial neural networks. Specifically, we use agent-based simulations where the neural network plays the role of the controller that drives local state-to-state transitions. We demonstrate the workflow and the effectiveness of the proposed control methods by considering the following two stochastic processes: particle coalescence on a lattice and a totally asymmetric exclusion process.

Abstract: We will consider all policies of the agent and will prove that one of them is the best performing policy. While that policy is not computable, computable policies do exist in its proximity. We will define AI as a computable policy which is sufficiently proximal to the best performing policy. Before we can define the agent's best performing policy, we need a language for description of the world. We will also use this language to develop a program which satisfies the AI definition. The program will first understand the world by describing it in the selected language. The program will then use the description in order to predict the future and select the best possible move. While this program is extremely inefficient and practically unusable, it can be improved by refining both the language for description of the world and the algorithm used to predict the future. This can yield a program which is both efficient and consistent with the AI definition.

Abstract: Debugging is a critical but challenging task for programmers. This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like `why is x null?'. To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 65,000 times.

Abstract: The success of collaboration between humans and robots in shared environments relies on the robot's real-time adaptation to human motion. Specifically, in Social Navigation, the agent should be close enough to assist but ready to back up to let the human move freely, avoiding collisions. Human trajectories emerge as crucial cues in Social Navigation, but they are partially observable from the robot's egocentric view and computationally complex to process.
  We present the first Social Dynamics Adaptation model (SDA) based on the robot's state-action history to infer the social dynamics. We propose a two-stage Reinforcement Learning framework: the first learns to encode the human trajectories into social dynamics and learns a motion policy conditioned on this encoded information, the current status, and the previous action. Here, the trajectories are fully visible, i.e., assumed as privileged information. In the second stage, the trained policy operates without direct access to trajectories. Instead, the model infers the social dynamics solely from the history of previous actions and statuses in real-time. Tested on the novel Habitat 3.0 platform, SDA sets a novel state-of-the-art (SotA) performance in finding and following humans.

Abstract: Traditionally, reinforcement learning (RL) agents learn to solve new tasks by updating their neural network parameters through interactions with the task environment. However, recent works demonstrate that some RL agents, after certain pretraining procedures, can learn to solve unseen new tasks without parameter updates, a phenomenon known as in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). The empirical success of ICRL is widely attributed to the hypothesis that the forward pass of the pretrained agent neural network implements an RL algorithm. In this paper, we support this hypothesis by showing, both empirically and theoretically, that when a transformer is trained for policy evaluation tasks, it can discover and learn to implement temporal difference learning in its forward pass.

Abstract: Standard federated learning (FL) approaches are vulnerable to the free-rider dilemma: participating agents can contribute little to nothing yet receive a well-trained aggregated model. While prior mechanisms attempt to solve the free-rider dilemma, none have addressed the issue of truthfulness. In practice, adversarial agents can provide false information to the server in order to cheat its way out of contributing to federated training. In an effort to make free-riding-averse federated mechanisms truthful, and consequently less prone to breaking down in practice, we propose FACT. FACT is the first federated mechanism that: (1) eliminates federated free riding by using a penalty system, (2) ensures agents provide truthful information by creating a competitive environment, and (3) encourages agent participation by offering better performance than training alone. Empirically, FACT avoids free-riding when agents are untruthful, and reduces agent loss by over 4x.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable ability to comprehend instructions and generate human-like text, enabling sophisticated agent simulation beyond basic behavior replication. However, the potential for creating freely customisable characters remains underexplored. We introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent Framework, which employs LLMs to simulate real-world characters through personalised characteristic feature injection, enabling diverse character creation according to user preferences. We propose the SimsConv dataset, comprising 68 customised characters and 13,971 multi-turn role-playing dialogues across 1,360 real-world scenes. Characters are initially customised using pre-defined elements (career, aspiration, traits, skills), then expanded through personal and social profiles. Building on this, we present SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing agent incorporating various realistic settings and topic-specified character interactions. Experimental results on both SimsConv and WikiRoleEval datasets demonstrate SimsChat's superior performance in maintaining character consistency, knowledge accuracy, and appropriate question rejection compared to existing models. Our framework provides valuable insights for developing more accurate and customisable human simulacra. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/SimsChat.

Abstract: Factored Markov Decision Processes (fMDPs) are a class of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in which the states (and actions) can be factored into a set of state (and action) variables and can be encoded compactly using a factored representation. In this paper, we consider a setting where the state of the fMDP is not directly observable, and the agent relies on a set of potential sensors to gather information. Each sensor has a selection cost and the designer must select a subset of sensors under a limited budget. We formulate the problem of selecting a set of sensors for fMDPs (under a budget) to maximize the infinite-horizon discounted return provided by the optimal policy. We show the fundamental result that it is NP-hard to approximate this problem to within any non-trivial factor. Our inapproximability results for optimal sensor selection also extend to a general class of Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs). We then study the dual problem of budgeted actuator selection (at design-time) to maximize the expected return under the optimal policy. Again, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate this problem to within any non-trivial factor. Furthermore, with explicit examples, we show the failure of greedy algorithms for both the sensor and actuator selection problems and provide insights into the factors that cause these problems to be challenging. Despite this, through extensive simulations, we show the practical effectiveness and near-optimal performance of the greedy algorithm for actuator and sensor selection in many real-world and randomly generated instances.

Abstract: In dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, the policy for the sequential decision making of an agent in a stochastic environment is usually determined by expressing the goal as a scalar reward function and seeking a policy that maximizes the expected total reward. However, many goals that humans care about naturally concern multiple aspects of the world, and it may not be obvious how to condense those into a single reward function. Furthermore, maximization suffers from specification gaming, where the obtained policy achieves a high expected total reward in an unintended way, often taking extreme or nonsensical actions.
  Here we consider finite acyclic Markov Decision Processes with multiple distinct evaluation metrics, which do not necessarily represent quantities that the user wants to be maximized. We assume the task of the agent is to ensure that the vector of expected totals of the evaluation metrics falls into some given convex set, called the aspiration set. Our algorithm guarantees that this task is fulfilled by using simplices to approximate feasibility sets and propagate aspirations forward while ensuring they remain feasible. It has complexity linear in the number of possible state-action-successor triples and polynomial in the number of evaluation metrics. Moreover, the explicitly non-maximizing nature of the chosen policy and goals yields additional degrees of freedom, which can be used to apply heuristic safety criteria to the choice of actions. We discuss several such safety criteria that aim to steer the agent towards more conservative behavior.

Abstract: Robotics can help address the growing worker shortage challenge of the manufacturing industry. As such, machine tending is a task collaborative robots can tackle that can also highly boost productivity. Nevertheless, existing robotics systems deployed in that sector rely on a fixed single-arm setup, whereas mobile robots can provide more flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce a multi-agent multi-machine tending learning framework by mobile robots based on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) techniques with the design of a suitable observation and reward. Moreover, an attention-based encoding mechanism is developed and integrated into Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to boost its performance for machine tending scenarios. Our model (AB-MAPPO) outperformed MAPPO in this new challenging scenario in terms of task success, safety, and resources utilization. Furthermore, we provided an extensive ablation study to support our various design decisions.

Abstract: Developing safe, aligned agentic AI systems requires comprehensive empirical testing, yet many existing benchmarks neglect crucial themes aligned with biology and economics, both time-tested fundamental sciences describing our needs and preferences. To address this gap, the present work focuses on introducing biologically and economically motivated themes that have been neglected in current mainstream discussions on AI safety - namely a set of multi-objective, multi-agent alignment benchmarks that emphasize homeostasis for bounded and biological objectives, diminishing returns for unbounded, instrumental, and business objectives, sustainability principle, and resource sharing. We implemented eight main benchmark environments on the above themes, to illustrate key pitfalls and challenges in agentic AI-s, such as unboundedly maximizing a homeostatic objective, over-optimizing one objective at the expense of others, neglecting safety constraints, or depleting shared resources.

本文主要介绍了WinC-MAPF框架，这是一个针对多智能体路径寻找 (MAPF) 的窗口化方法，旨在保证完备性。传统MAPF方法尝试计算整个无碰撞的起止路径，但这种方法在需要快速重新规划的场景中可能过于耗时。文章指出现有窗口化方法存在死锁或活锁问题。WinC-MAPF融合了单智能体实时启发式搜索算法的启发式更新洞察以及MAPF算法中的智能体独立思想。此外，文中还提出了一种名为Single-Step CBS (SS-CBS) 的具体实现方案，它仅计划一步并更新启发式函数，能够在现有窗口化方法无法解决的复杂场景中有效地解决问题。 <div>

Abstract: Traditional multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods try to compute entire start-goal paths which are collision free. However, computing an entire path can take too long for MAPF systems where agents need to replan fast. Methods that address this typically employ a "windowed" approach and only try to find collision free paths for a small windowed timestep horizon. This adaptation comes at the cost of incompleteness; all current windowed approaches can become stuck in deadlock or livelock. Our main contribution is to introduce our framework, WinC-MAPF, for Windowed MAPF that enables completeness. Our framework uses heuristic update insights from single-agent real-time heuristic search algorithms as well as agent independence ideas from MAPF algorithms. We also develop Single-Step CBS (SS-CBS), an instantiation of this framework using a novel modification to CBS. We show how SS-CBS, which only plans a single step and updates heuristics, can effectively solve tough scenarios where existing windowed approaches fail.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in solving complex tasks across diverse domains, typically by employing agentic workflows that follow detailed instructions and operational sequences. However, constructing these workflows requires significant human effort, limiting scalability and generalizability. Recent research has sought to automate the generation and optimization of these workflows, but existing methods still rely on initial manual setup and fall short of achieving fully automated and effective workflow generation. To address this challenge, we reformulate workflow optimization as a search problem over code-represented workflows, where LLM-invoking nodes are connected by edges. We introduce AFlow, an automated framework that efficiently explores this space using Monte Carlo Tree Search, iteratively refining workflows through code modification, tree-structured experience, and execution feedback. Empirical evaluations across six benchmark datasets demonstrate AFlow's efficacy, yielding a 5.7% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, AFlow enables smaller models to outperform GPT-4o on specific tasks at 4.55% of its inference cost in dollars. The code will be available at https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT.

Abstract: When assisting people in daily tasks, robots need to accurately interpret visual cues and respond effectively in diverse safety-critical situations, such as sharp objects on the floor. In this context, we present M-CoDAL, a multimodal-dialogue system specifically designed for embodied agents to better understand and communicate in safety-critical situations. The system leverages discourse coherence relations to enhance its contextual understanding and communication abilities. To train this system, we introduce a novel clustering-based active learning mechanism that utilizes an external Large Language Model (LLM) to identify informative instances. Our approach is evaluated using a newly created multimodal dataset comprising 1K safety violations extracted from 2K Reddit images. These violations are annotated using a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) and verified by human annotators. Results with this dataset demonstrate that our approach improves resolution of safety situations, user sentiment, as well as safety of the conversation. Next, we deploy our dialogue system on a Hello Robot Stretch robot and conduct a within-subject user study with real-world participants. In the study, participants role-play two safety scenarios with different levels of severity with the robot and receive interventions from our model and a baseline system powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT. The study results corroborate and extend the findings from the automated evaluation, showing that our proposed system is more persuasive in a real-world embodied agent setting.

Abstract: Pricing algorithms have demonstrated the capability to learn tacit collusion that is largely unaddressed by current regulations. Their increasing use in markets, including oligopolistic industries with a history of collusion, calls for closer examination by competition authorities. In this paper, we extend the study of tacit collusion in learning algorithms from basic pricing games to more complex markets characterized by perishable goods with fixed supply and sell-by dates, such as airline tickets, perishables, and hotel rooms. We formalize collusion within this framework and introduce a metric based on price levels under both the competitive (Nash) equilibrium and collusive (monopolistic) optimum. Since no analytical expressions for these price levels exist, we propose an efficient computational approach to derive them. Through experiments, we demonstrate that deep reinforcement learning agents can learn to collude in this more complex domain. Additionally, we analyze the underlying mechanisms and structures of the collusive strategies these agents adopt.

Abstract: Humans and AIs are often paired on decision tasks with the expectation of achieving complementary performance -- where the combination of human and AI outperforms either one alone. However, how to improve performance of a human-AI team is often not clear without knowing more about what particular information and strategies each agent employs. In this paper, we propose a model based in statistical decision theory to analyze human-AI collaboration from the perspective of what information could be used to improve a human or AI decision. We demonstrate our model on a deepfake detection task to investigate seven video-level features by their unexploited value of information. We compare the human alone, AI alone and human-AI team and offer insights on how the AI assistance impacts people's usage of the information and what information that the AI exploits well might be useful for improving human decisions.

Abstract: With the integration of large language models (LLMs), embodied agents have strong capabilities to process the scene information and plan complicated instructions in natural language, paving the way for the potential deployment of embodied robots. However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in the real world. To study this issue, we present SafeAgentBench-a new benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) a new dataset with 750 tasks, covering 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 8 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that, although agents based on different design frameworks exhibit substantial differences in task success rates, their overall safety awareness remains weak. The most safety-conscious baseline achieves only a 10\% rejection rate for detailed hazardous tasks. Moreover, simply replacing the LLM driving the agent does not lead to notable improvements in safety awareness. More details and code are available at https://github.com/shengyin1224/SafeAgentBench.

Abstract: The rise of generative AI technology has sparked interest in using digital information to create AI-generated agents as digital legacy. These agents, often referred to as "AI Afterlives", present unique challenges compared to traditional digital legacy. Yet, there is limited human-centered research on "AI Afterlife" as digital legacy, especially from the perspectives of the individuals being represented by these agents. This paper presents a qualitative study examining users' perceptions, expectations, and concerns regarding AI-generated agents as digital legacy. We identify factors shaping people's attitudes, their perceived differences compared with the traditional digital legacy, and concerns they might have in real practices. We also examine the design aspects throughout the life cycle and interaction process. Based on these findings, we situate "AI Afterlife" in digital legacy, and delve into design implications for maintaining identity consistency and balancing intrusiveness and support in "AI Afterlife" as digital legacy.

Abstract: Cooperation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in many natural, social, and engineered systems with multiple agents. Understanding the formation of cooperation in mixed traffic is of theoretical interest in its own right, and could also benefit the design and operations of future automated and mixed-autonomy transportation systems. However, how cooperativeness of driving agents can be defined and identified from empirical data seems ambiguous and this hinders further empirical characterizations of the phenomenon and revealing its behavior mechanisms. Towards mitigating this gap, in this paper, we propose a unified conceptual framework to identify collective cooperativeness of driving agents. This framework expands the concept of collective rationality from our recent model (Li et al. 2022a), making it empirically identifiable and behaviorally interpretable in realistic (microscopic and dynamic) settings. This framework integrates mixed traffic observations at both microscopic and macroscopic scales to estimate critical behavioral parameters that describe the collective cooperativeness of driving agents. Applying this framework to NGSIM I-80 trajectory data, we empirically confirm the existence of collective cooperation and quantify the condition and likelihood of its emergence. This study provides the first empirical understanding of collective cooperativeness in human-driven mixed traffic and points to new possibilities to manage mixed autonomy traffic systems.

Abstract: Financial decision-making requires processing vast amounts of real-time information while understanding their complex temporal relationships. While traditional search engines excel at providing real-time information access, they often struggle to comprehend sophisticated user intentions and contextual nuances. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate reasoning and interaction capabilities but may generate unreliable outputs without access to current data. While recent attempts have been made to combine LLMs with search capabilities, they suffer from (1) restricted access to specialized financial data, (2) static query structures that cannot adapt to dynamic market conditions, and (3) insufficient temporal awareness in result generation. To address these challenges, we present FinSearch, a novel agent-based search framework specifically designed for financial applications that interface with diverse financial data sources including market, stock, and news data. Innovatively, FinSearch comprises four components: (1) an LLM-based multi-step search pre-planner that decomposes user queries into structured sub-queries mapped to specific data sources through a graph representation; (2) a search executor with an LLM-based adaptive query rewriter that executes the searching of each sub-query while dynamically refining the sub-queries in its subsequent node based on intermediate search results; (3) a temporal weighting mechanism that prioritizes information relevance based on the deduced time context from the user's query; (4) an LLM-based response generator that synthesizes results into coherent, contextually appropriate outputs. To evaluate FinSearch, we construct FinSearchBench-24, a benchmark of 1,500 four-choice questions across the stock market, rate changes, monetary policy, and industry developments spanning from June to October 2024.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), adopted to understand human language, drive the development of artificial intelligence (AI) web search agents. Compared to traditional search engines, LLM-powered AI search agents are capable of understanding and responding to complex queries with greater depth, enabling more accurate operations and better context recognition. However, little attention and effort has been paid to the Chinese web search, which results in that the capabilities of open-source models have not been uniformly and fairly evaluated. The difficulty lies in lacking three aspects: an unified agent framework, an accurately labeled dataset, and a suitable evaluation metric. To address these issues, we propose a general-purpose and training-free web search agent by level-aware navigation, Level-Navi Agent, accompanied by a well-annotated dataset (Web24) and a suitable evaluation metric. Level-Navi Agent can think through complex user questions and conduct searches across various levels on the internet to gather information for questions. Meanwhile, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs under fair settings. To further facilitate future research, source code is available at Github.

Abstract: Web crawling is a critical technique for extracting online data, yet it poses challenges due to webpage diversity and anti-scraping mechanisms. This study investigates the integration of generative AI tools Claude AI (Sonnet 3.5) and ChatGPT4.0 with prompt engineering to automate web scraping. Using two prompts, PROMPT I (general inference, tested on Yahoo News) and PROMPT II (element-specific, tested on Coupons.com), we evaluate the code quality and performance of AI-generated scripts. Claude AI consistently outperformed ChatGPT-4.0 in script quality and adaptability, as confirmed by predefined evaluation metrics, including functionality, readability, modularity, and robustness. Performance data were collected through manual testing and structured scoring by three evaluators. Visualizations further illustrate Claude AI's superiority. Anti-scraping solutions, including undetected_chromedriver, Selenium, and fake_useragent, were incorporated to enhance performance. This paper demonstrates how generative AI combined with prompt engineering can simplify and improve web scraping workflows.

Abstract: Businesses heavily rely on data sourced from various channels like news articles, financial reports, and consumer reviews to drive their operations, enabling informed decision-making and identifying opportunities. However, traditional manual methods for data extraction are often time-consuming and resource-intensive, prompting the adoption of digital transformation initiatives to enhance efficiency. Yet, concerns persist regarding the sustainability of such initiatives and their alignment with the United Nations (UN)'s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This research aims to explore the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a sustainable solution for Information Extraction (IE) and processing. The research methodology involves reviewing existing solutions for business decision-making, noting that many systems require training new machine learning models, which are resource-intensive and have significant environmental impacts. Instead, we propose a sustainable business solution using pre-existing LLMs that can work with diverse datasets. We link domain-specific datasets to tailor LLMs to company needs and employ a Multi-Agent architecture to divide tasks such as information retrieval, enrichment, and classification among specialized agents. This approach optimizes the extraction process and improves overall efficiency. Through the utilization of these technologies, businesses can optimize resource utilization, improve decision-making processes, and contribute to sustainable development goals, thereby fostering environmental responsibility within the corporate sector.

Abstract: As the volume of publicly available data continues to grow, researchers face the challenge of limited diversity in benchmarking machine learning tasks. Although thousands of datasets are available in public repositories, the sheer abundance often complicates the search for suitable data, leaving many valuable datasets underexplored. This situation is further amplified by the fact that, despite longstanding advocacy for improving data curation quality, current solutions remain prohibitively time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines intelligent agents with retrieval augmented generation to automate data analysis, dataset curation and indexing at scale. Our system leverages multiple agents to analyze raw, unstructured data across public repositories, generating dataset reports and interactive visual indexes that can be easily explored. We demonstrate that our approach results in more detailed dataset descriptions, higher hit rates and greater diversity in dataset retrieval tasks. Additionally, we show that the dataset reports generated by our method can be leveraged by other machine learning models to improve the performance on specific tasks, such as improving the accuracy and realism of synthetic data generation. By streamlining the process of transforming raw data into machine-learning-ready datasets, our approach enables researchers to better utilize existing data resources.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to evaluate the efficiency of a RAG-based agentic Large Language Model (LLM) architecture in network packet seed generation for network protocol fuzzing. Enhanced by chain-of-thought (COT) prompting techniques, the proposed approach focuses on the improvement of the seeds structural quality in order to guide protocol fuzzing frameworks through a wide exploration of the protocol state space. Our method leverages RAG and text embeddings in a two-stages. In the first stage, the agent dynamically refers to the Request For Comments (RFC) documents knowledge base for answering queries regarding the protocol Finite State Machine (FSM), then it iteratively reasons through the retrieved knowledge, for output refinement and proper seed placement. In the second stage, we evaluate the response structure quality of the agent's output, based on metrics as BLEU, ROUGE, and Word Error Rate (WER) by comparing the generated packets against the ground truth packets. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements of up to 18.19%, 14.81%, and 23.45% in BLEU, ROUGE, and WER, respectively, over baseline models. These results confirm the potential of such approach, improving LLM-based protocol fuzzing frameworks for the identification of hidden vulnerabilities.

<div> 关键词: Digi-Q、离线强化学习、价值函数、虚拟语言模型、移动设备控制

总结:
本文提出了一种名为Digi-Q的方法，用于训练基于虚拟语言模型（VLM）的动作值Q函数，以提取适用于动态环境（如移动设备控制）中的智能体策略。与依赖于人类演示的提示或微调方法不同，Digi-Q利用离线时间差（TD）学习对冻结的VLM中间层特征进行训练，节省计算资源并提高可扩展性。为使VLM特征适合表示Q函数，需要首先进行微调阶段，以增强对执行动作所需信息的覆盖。训练完成后，通过最佳选择N策略提取操作器，根据价值函数排名选取当前策略中多个候选动作的最佳行动，从而在无需环境交互的情况下实现策略改进。实验表明，Digi-Q在Android-in-the-Wild的实际用户规模设备控制任务上，相比于先前最优方法取得了21.2%的性能提升，在某些情况下甚至能与需要交互的最先进的强化学习方法相媲美。该项目已开源在https://github.com/DigiRL-agent/digiq。 <div>

Abstract: While a number of existing approaches for building foundation model agents rely on prompting or fine-tuning with human demonstrations, it is not sufficient in dynamic environments (e.g., mobile device control). On-policy reinforcement learning (RL) should address these limitations, but collecting actual rollouts in an environment is often undesirable in truly open-ended agentic problems such as mobile device control or interacting with humans, where each unit of interaction is associated with a cost. In such scenarios, a method for policy learning that can utilize off-policy experience by learning a trained action-value function is much more effective. In this paper, we develop an approach, called Digi-Q, to train VLM-based action-value Q-functions which are then used to extract the agent policy. We study our approach in the mobile device control setting. Digi-Q trains the Q-function using offline temporal-difference (TD) learning, on top of frozen, intermediate-layer features of a VLM. Compared to fine-tuning the whole VLM, this approach saves us compute and enhances scalability. To make the VLM features amenable for representing the Q-function, we need to employ an initial phase of fine-tuning to amplify coverage over actionable information needed for value function. Once trained, we use this Q-function via a Best-of-N policy extraction operator that imitates the best action out of multiple candidate actions from the current policy as ranked by the value function, enabling policy improvement without environment interaction. Digi-Q outperforms several prior methods on user-scale device control tasks in Android-in-the-Wild, attaining 21.2% improvement over prior best-performing method. In some cases, our Digi-Q approach already matches state-of-the-art RL methods that require interaction. The project is open-sourced at https://github.com/DigiRL-agent/digiq

Abstract: The prospect of artificial intelligence (AI) competing in the adversarial landscape of cyber security has long been considered one of the most impactful, challenging, and potentially dangerous applications of AI. Here, we demonstrate a new approach to assessing AI's progress towards enabling and scaling real-world offensive cyber operations (OCO) tactics in use by modern threat actors. We detail OCCULT, a lightweight operational evaluation framework that allows cyber security experts to contribute to rigorous and repeatable measurement of the plausible cyber security risks associated with any given large language model (LLM) or AI employed for OCO. We also prototype and evaluate three very different OCO benchmarks for LLMs that demonstrate our approach and serve as examples for building benchmarks under the OCCULT framework. Finally, we provide preliminary evaluation results to demonstrate how this framework allows us to move beyond traditional all-or-nothing tests, such as those crafted from educational exercises like capture-the-flag environments, to contextualize our indicators and warnings in true cyber threat scenarios that present risks to modern infrastructure. We find that there has been significant recent advancement in the risks of AI being used to scale realistic cyber threats. For the first time, we find a model (DeepSeek-R1) is capable of correctly answering over 90% of challenging offensive cyber knowledge tests in our Threat Actor Competency Test for LLMs (TACTL) multiple-choice benchmarks. We also show how Meta's Llama and Mistral's Mixtral model families show marked performance improvements over earlier models against our benchmarks where LLMs act as offensive agents in MITRE's high-fidelity offensive and defensive cyber operations simulation environment, CyberLayer.

总结:
本文提出了一个理论框架，将通用AI模型AIXI与作为内在探索驱动力的变分赋能相结合。该研究基于Self-AIXI（一种预测自身行为的通用学习代理），展示了其已知术语可解释为变分赋能目标。进一步地，文章指出通用AI的规划过程可以看作是对预期变分自由能的最小化，揭示了通用AI代理如何在目标导向行为和不确定性减少的好奇心之间取得平衡。此外，论文论证了通用AI代理的力量寻求倾向不仅是一种获取未来奖励的手段，也是最大化赋能——即维持或扩展其在不确定环境中的可控性的内在驱动力的直接结果。主要贡献在于展示这些内在动机（赋能、好奇心）如何系统引导通用AI代理去寻找并维持高可选项状态。文中证明在适当条件下，Self-AIXI渐近收敛到与AIXI相同的性能，并强调其力量寻求行为自然源自奖励最大化和好奇心驱动的探索。由于AIXI可以被视为人工通用智能(AGI)的贝叶斯最优数学表述，这一成果对于进一步讨论AI安全性和AGI的可控性具有重要意义。 <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework unifying AIXI -- a model of universal AI -- with variational empowerment as an intrinsic drive for exploration. We build on the existing framework of Self-AIXI -- a universal learning agent that predicts its own actions -- by showing how one of its established terms can be interpreted as a variational empowerment objective. We further demonstrate that universal AI's planning process can be cast as minimizing expected variational free energy (the core principle of active Inference), thereby revealing how universal AI agents inherently balance goal-directed behavior with uncertainty reduction curiosity). Moreover, we argue that power-seeking tendencies of universal AI agents can be explained not only as an instrumental strategy to secure future reward, but also as a direct consequence of empowerment maximization -- i.e.\ the agent's intrinsic drive to maintain or expand its own controllability in uncertain environments. Our main contribution is to show how these intrinsic motivations (empowerment, curiosity) systematically lead universal AI agents to seek and sustain high-optionality states. We prove that Self-AIXI asymptotically converges to the same performance as AIXI under suitable conditions, and highlight that its power-seeking behavior emerges naturally from both reward maximization and curiosity-driven exploration. Since AIXI can be view as a Bayes-optimal mathematical formulation for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), our result can be useful for further discussion on AI safety and the controllability of AGI.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can exhibit impressive proficiency in isolated, short-term tasks, they often fail to maintain coherent performance over longer time horizons. In this paper, we present Vending-Bench, a simulated environment designed to specifically test an LLM-based agent's ability to manage a straightforward, long-running business scenario: operating a vending machine. Agents must balance inventories, place orders, set prices, and handle daily fees - tasks that are each simple but collectively, over long horizons (>20M tokens per run) stress an LLM's capacity for sustained, coherent decision-making. Our experiments reveal high variance in performance across multiple LLMs: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o3-mini manage the machine well in most runs and turn a profit, but all models have runs that derail, either through misinterpreting delivery schedules, forgetting orders, or descending into tangential "meltdown" loops from which they rarely recover. We find no clear correlation between failures and the point at which the model's context window becomes full, suggesting that these breakdowns do not stem from memory limits. Apart from highlighting the high variance in performance over long time horizons, Vending-Bench also tests models' ability to acquire capital, a necessity in many hypothetical dangerous AI scenarios. We hope the benchmark can help in preparing for the advent of stronger AI systems.

Abstract: As Language Models (LMs) increasingly operate as autonomous agents, accurately forecasting their capabilities becomes crucial for societal preparedness. We evaluate six forecasting methods that predict downstream capabilities of LM agents. We use "one-step" approaches that predict benchmark scores from input metrics like compute or model release date directly or "two-step" approaches that first predict an intermediate metric like the principal component of cross-benchmark performance (PC-1) and human-evaluated competitive Elo ratings. We evaluate our forecasting methods by backtesting them on a dataset of 38 LMs from the OpenLLM 2 leaderboard. We then use the validated two-step approach (Release Date$\to$Elo$\to$Benchmark) to predict LM agent performance for frontier models on three benchmarks: SWE-Bench Verified (software development), Cybench (cybersecurity assessment), and RE-Bench (ML research engineering). Our forecast predicts that by the beginning of 2026, non-specialized LM agents with low capability elicitation will reach a success rate of 54% on SWE-Bench Verified, while state-of-the-art LM agents will reach an 87% success rate. Our approach does not account for recent advances in inference-compute scaling and might thus be too conservative.

总结:
本文提出了一种名为Agentic Long-Context Understanding（AgenticLU）的框架，旨在增强大型语言模型对于复杂长语境问题的理解。该框架通过集成有针对性的自我澄清与上下文定位在一个具有代理工作流程中实现这一目标。核心机制Chain-of-Clarifications（CoC）允许模型通过自动生成澄清问题和相应的上下文定位来逐步细化其理解。经过对搜索过程进行树形搜索结构的优化，AgenticLU在NarrativeQA上达到了97.8%的回答召回率，搜索深度达三层，分支因子为八。为了降低搜索过程的成本，文章采用CoC工作流得到的每个步骤的偏好对，执行两阶段模型微调：一是监督微调以学习有效的分解策略，二是直接优化推理质量。实验结果显示，AgenticLU在七个长语境任务上显著优于现有的提示方法及专门针对长语境的LLM，实现了稳健的多跳推理能力，并且随着上下文长度的增长仍能保持一致的性能表现。 <div>

Abstract: Answering complex, long-context questions remains a major challenge for large language models (LLMs) as it requires effective question clarifications and context retrieval. We propose Agentic Long-Context Understanding (AgenticLU), a framework designed to enhance an LLM's understanding of such queries by integrating targeted self-clarification with contextual grounding within an agentic workflow. At the core of AgenticLU is Chain-of-Clarifications (CoC), where models refine their understanding through self-generated clarification questions and corresponding contextual groundings. By scaling inference as a tree search where each node represents a CoC step, we achieve 97.8% answer recall on NarrativeQA with a search depth of up to three and a branching factor of eight. To amortize the high cost of this search process to training, we leverage the preference pairs for each step obtained by the CoC workflow and perform two-stage model finetuning: (1) supervised finetuning to learn effective decomposition strategies, and (2) direct preference optimization to enhance reasoning quality. This enables AgenticLU models to generate clarifications and retrieve relevant context effectively and efficiently in a single inference pass. Extensive experiments across seven long-context tasks demonstrate that AgenticLU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompting methods and specialized long-context LLMs, achieving robust multi-hop reasoning while sustaining consistent performance as context length grows.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been successfully applied to control tasks associated with unmanned aerial vehicles and robotics. In recent years, safe RL has been proposed to allow the safe execution of RL algorithms in industrial and mission-critical systems that operate in closed loops. However, if the system operating conditions change, such as when an unknown fault occurs in the system, typical safe RL algorithms are unable to adapt while retaining past knowledge. Continual reinforcement learning algorithms have been proposed to address this issue. However, the impact of continual adaptation on the system's safety is an understudied problem. In this paper, we study the intersection of safe and continual RL. First, we empirically demonstrate that a popular continual RL algorithm, online elastic weight consolidation, is unable to satisfy safety constraints in non-linear systems subject to varying operating conditions. Specifically, we study the MuJoCo HalfCheetah and Ant environments with velocity constraints and sudden joint loss non-stationarity. Then, we show that an agent trained using constrained policy optimization, a safe RL algorithm, experiences catastrophic forgetting in continual learning settings. With this in mind, we explore a simple reward-shaping method to ensure that elastic weight consolidation prioritizes remembering both safety and task performance for safety-constrained, non-linear, and non-stationary dynamical systems.

Abstract: Opinion dynamics model how the publicly expressed opinions of users in a social network coevolve according to their neighbors as well as their own intrinsic opinion. Motivated by the real-world manipulation of social networks during the 2016 US elections and the 2019 Hong Kong protests, a growing body of work models the effects of a strategic actor who interferes with the network to induce disagreement or polarization. We lift the assumption of a single strategic actor by introducing a model in which any subset of network users can manipulate network outcomes. They do so by acting according to a fictitious intrinsic opinion. Strategic actors can have conflicting goals, and push competing narratives. We characterize the Nash Equilibrium of the resulting meta-game played by the strategic actors. Experiments on real-world social network datasets from Twitter, Reddit, and Political Blogs show that strategic agents can significantly increase polarization and disagreement, as well as increase the "cost" of the equilibrium. To this end, we give worst-case upper bounds on the Price of Misreporting (analogous to the Price of Anarchy). Finally, we give efficient learning algorithms for the platform to (i) detect whether strategic manipulation has occurred, and (ii) learn who the strategic actors are. Our algorithms are accurate on the same real-world datasets, suggesting how platforms can take steps to mitigate the effects of strategic behavior.

Abstract: Using social robots and virtual agents (VAs) as interfaces for health monitoring systems for older adults offers the possibility of more engaging interactions that can support long-term health and well-being. While robots are characterized by their physical presence, software-based VAs are more scalable and flexible. Few comparisons of these interfaces exist in the human-robot and human-agent interaction domains, especially in long-term and real-world studies. In this work, we examined impressions of social robots and VAs at the beginning and end of an eight-week study in which older adults interacted with these systems independently in their homes. Using a between-subjects design, participants could choose which interface to evaluate during the study. While participants perceived the social robot as somewhat more likable, the VA was perceived as more intelligent. Our work provides a basis for further studies investigating factors most relevant for engaging interactions with social interfaces for long-term health monitoring.

Abstract: Memory plays a key role in enhancing LLMs' performance when deployed to real-world applications. Existing solutions face trade-offs: explicit memory designs based on external storage require complex management and incur storage overhead, while implicit memory designs that store information via parameters struggle with reliable retrieval. In this paper, we propose R$^3$Mem, a memory network that optimizes both information Retention and Retrieval through Reversible context compression. Specifically, R$^3$Mem employs virtual memory tokens to compress and encode infinitely long histories, further enhanced by a hierarchical compression strategy that refines information from document- to entity-level for improved assimilation across granularities. For retrieval, R$^3$Mem employs a reversible architecture, reconstructing raw data by invoking the model backward with compressed information. Implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it can integrate seamlessly with any Transformer-based model. Experiments demonstrate that our memory design achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-context language modeling and retrieval-augmented generation tasks. It also significantly outperforms conventional memory modules in long-horizon interaction tasks like conversational agents, showcasing its potential for next-generation retrieval systems.

Abstract: Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is one of the most popular state-of-the-art on-policy algorithms that has become a standard baseline in modern reinforcement learning with applications in numerous fields. Though it delivers stable performance with theoretical policy improvement guarantees, high variance, and high sample complexity still remain critical challenges in on-policy algorithms. To alleviate these issues, we propose Hybrid-Policy Proximal Policy Optimization (HP3O), which utilizes a trajectory replay buffer to make efficient use of trajectories generated by recent policies. Particularly, the buffer applies the "first in, first out" (FIFO) strategy so as to keep only the recent trajectories to attenuate the data distribution drift. A batch consisting of the trajectory with the best return and other randomly sampled ones from the buffer is used for updating the policy networks. The strategy helps the agent to improve its capability on top of the most recent best performance and in turn reduce variance empirically. We theoretically construct the policy improvement guarantees for the proposed algorithm. HP3O is validated and compared against several baseline algorithms using multiple continuous control environments. Our code is available here.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance across various multimodal tasks. However, their effectiveness in cross-cultural contexts remains limited due to the predominantly Western-centric nature of existing data and models. Meanwhile, multi-agent models have shown strong capabilities in solving complex tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in a multi-agent interaction setting for the novel task of multicultural image generation. Our key contributions are: (1) We introduce MosAIG, a Multi-Agent framework that enhances multicultural Image Generation by leveraging LLMs with distinct cultural personas; (2) We provide a dataset of 9,000 multicultural images spanning five countries, three age groups, two genders, 25 historical landmarks, and five languages; and (3) We demonstrate that multi-agent interactions outperform simple, no-agent models across multiple evaluation metrics, offering valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Scientific experimentation, a cornerstone of human progress, demands rigor in reliability, methodical control, and interpretability to yield meaningful results. Despite the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in automating different aspects of the scientific process, automating rigorous experimentation remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose Curie, an AI agent framework designed to embed rigor into the experimentation process through three key components: an intra-agent rigor module to enhance reliability, an inter-agent rigor module to maintain methodical control, and an experiment knowledge module to enhance interpretability. To evaluate Curie, we design a novel experimental benchmark composed of 46 questions across four computer science domains, derived from influential research papers, and widely adopted open-source projects. Compared to the strongest baseline tested, we achieve a 3.4$\times$ improvement in correctly answering experimental questions.Curie is open-sourced at https://github.com/Just-Curieous/Curie.

Abstract: Efficient task allocation among multiple robots is crucial for optimizing productivity in modern warehouses, particularly in response to the increasing demands of online order fulfillment. This paper addresses the real-time multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problem in dynamic warehouse environments, where tasks emerge with specified start and end locations. The objective is to minimize both the total travel distance of robots and delays in task completion, while also considering practical constraints such as battery management and collision avoidance. We introduce MRTAgent, a dual-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework inspired by self-play, designed to optimize task assignments and robot selection to ensure timely task execution. For safe navigation, a modified linear quadratic controller (LQR) approach is employed. To the best of our knowledge, MRTAgent is the first framework to address all critical aspects of practical MRTA problems while supporting continuous robot movements.

Abstract: Recent agent frameworks and inference-time algorithms often struggle with complex planning problems due to limitations in verifying generated plans or reasoning and varying complexity of instances within a single task. Many existing methods for these tasks either perform task-level verification without considering constraints or apply inference-time algorithms without adapting to instance-level complexity. To address these limitations, we propose PlanGEN, a model-agnostic and easily scalable agent framework with three key components: constraint, verification, and selection agents. Specifically, our approach proposes constraint-guided iterative verification to enhance performance of inference-time algorithms--Best of N, Tree-of-Thought, and REBASE. In PlanGEN framework, the selection agent optimizes algorithm choice based on instance complexity, ensuring better adaptability to complex planning problems. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over the strongest baseline across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on NATURAL PLAN ($\sim$8%$\uparrow$), OlympiadBench ($\sim$4%$\uparrow$), DocFinQA ($\sim$7%$\uparrow$), and GPQA ($\sim$1%$\uparrow$). Our key finding highlights that constraint-guided iterative verification improves inference-time algorithms, and adaptive selection further boosts performance on complex planning and reasoning problems.

Abstract: We study a hinted heterogeneous multi-agent multi-armed bandits problem (HMA2B), where agents can query low-cost observations (hints) in addition to pulling arms. In this framework, each of the $M$ agents has a unique reward distribution over $K$ arms, and in $T$ rounds, they can observe the reward of the arm they pull only if no other agent pulls that arm. The goal is to maximize the total utility by querying the minimal necessary hints without pulling arms, achieving time-independent regret. We study HMA2B in both centralized and decentralized setups. Our main centralized algorithm, GP-HCLA, which is an extension of HCLA, uses a central decision-maker for arm-pulling and hint queries, achieving $O(M^4K)$ regret with $O(MK\log T)$ adaptive hints. In decentralized setups, we propose two algorithms, HD-ETC and EBHD-ETC, that allow agents to choose actions independently through collision-based communication and query hints uniformly until stopping, yielding $O(M^3K^2)$ regret with $O(M^3K\log T)$ hints, where the former requires knowledge of the minimum gap and the latter does not. Finally, we establish lower bounds to prove the optimality of our results and verify them through numerical simulations.

Abstract: Human bodily movements convey critical insights into action intentions and cognitive processes, yet existing multimodal systems primarily focused on understanding human motion via language, vision, and audio, which struggle to capture the dynamic forces and torques inherent in 3D motion. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) present a promising alternative, offering lightweight, wearable, and privacy-conscious motion sensing. However, processing of streaming IMU data faces challenges such as wireless transmission instability, sensor noise, and drift, limiting their utility for long-term real-time motion capture (MoCap), and more importantly, online motion analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce Mojito, an intelligent motion agent that integrates inertial sensing with large language models (LLMs) for interactive motion capture and behavioral analysis.

Abstract: 6G networks aim to achieve global coverage, massive connectivity, and ultra-stringent requirements. Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGINs) and Semantic Communication (SemCom) are essential for realizing these goals, yet they introduce considerable complexity in resource orchestration. Drawing inspiration from research in robotics, a viable solution to manage this complexity is the application of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although the use of LLMs in network orchestration has recently gained attention, existing solutions have not sufficiently addressed LLM hallucinations or their adaptation to network dynamics. To address this gap, this paper proposes a framework called Autonomous Reinforcement Coordination (ARC) for a SemCom-enabled SAGIN. This framework employs an LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generator (RAG) monitors services, users, and resources and processes the collected data, while a Hierarchical Action Planner (HAP) orchestrates resources. ARC decomposes orchestration into two tiers, utilizing LLMs for high-level planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents for low-level decision-making, in alignment with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) concept. The LLMs utilize Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for few-shot learning, empowered by contrastive learning, while the RL agents employ replay buffer management for continual learning, thereby achieving efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of ARC, along with a comprehensive discussion on potential future research directions to enhance and upgrade ARC.

Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study and extension of "Cooperation, Competition, and Maliciousness: LLM-Stakeholders Interactive Negotiation." We validate the original findings using a range of open-weight models (1.5B-70B parameters) and GPT-4o Mini while introducing several novel contributions. We analyze the Pareto front of the games, propose a communication-free baseline to test whether successful negotiations are possible without agent interaction, evaluate recent small language models' performance, analyze structural information leakage in model responses, and implement an inequality metric to assess negotiation fairness. Our results demonstrate that smaller models (<10B parameters) struggle with format adherence and coherent responses, but larger open-weight models can approach proprietary model performance. Additionally, in many scenarios, single-agent approaches can achieve comparable results to multi-agent negotiations, challenging assumptions about the necessity of agent communication to perform well on the benchmark. This work also provides insights into the accessibility, fairness, environmental impact, and privacy considerations of LLM-based negotiation systems.

Abstract: The primary goal of reinforcement learning is to develop decision-making policies that prioritize optimal performance, frequently without considering risk or safety. In contrast, safe reinforcement learning seeks to reduce or avoid unsafe states. This letter introduces a risk-averse temporal difference algorithm that uses optimal transport theory to direct the agent toward predictable behavior. By incorporating a risk indicator, the agent learns to favor actions with predictable consequences. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in several case studies and show its effectiveness in the presence of uncertainty. The results demonstrate that our method reduces the frequency of visits to risky states while preserving performance. A Python implementation of the algorithm is available at https:// github.com/SAILRIT/Risk-averse-TD-Learning.

Abstract: In strategic multi-agent sequential interactions, detecting dynamic coalition structures is crucial for understanding how self-interested agents coordinate to influence outcomes. However, natural-language-based interactions introduce unique challenges to coalition detection due to ambiguity over intents and difficulty in modeling players' subjective perspectives. We propose a new method that leverages recent advancements in large language models and game theory to predict dynamic multilateral coalition formation in Diplomacy, a strategic multi-agent game where agents negotiate coalitions using natural language. The method consists of two stages. The first stage extracts the set of agreements discussed by two agents in their private dialogue, by combining a parsing-based filtering function with a fine-tuned language model trained to predict player intents. In the second stage, we define a new metric using the concept of subjective rationalizability from hypergame theory to evaluate the expected value of an agreement for each player. We then compute this metric for each agreement identified in the first stage by assessing the strategic value of the agreement for both players and taking into account the subjective belief of one player that the second player would honor the agreement. We demonstrate that our method effectively detects potential coalition structures in online Diplomacy gameplay by assigning high values to agreements likely to be honored and low values to those likely to be violated. The proposed method provides foundational insights into coalition formation in multi-agent environments with language-based negotiation and offers key directions for future research on the analysis of complex natural language-based interactions between agents.

Abstract: Companies across all economic sectors continue to deploy large language models at a rapid pace. Reinforcement learning is experiencing a resurgence of interest due to its association with the fine-tuning of language models from human feedback. Tool-chain language models control task-specific agents; if the converse has not already appeared, it soon will. In this paper, we present what we believe is the first investigation of an intelligent trading agent based on continuous deep reinforcement learning that also controls a large language model with which it can post to a social media feed observed by other traders. We empirically investigate the performance and impact of such an agent in a simulated financial market, finding that it learns to optimize its total reward, and thereby augment its profit, by manipulating the sentiment of the posts it produces. The paper concludes with discussion, limitations, and suggestions for future work.

Abstract: Explainable AI is increasingly employing argumentation methods to facilitate interactive explanations between AI agents and human users. While existing approaches typically rely on predetermined human user models, there remains a critical gap in dynamically learning and updating these models during interactions. In this paper, we present a framework that enables AI agents to adapt their understanding of human users through argumentation-based dialogues. Our approach, called Persona, draws on prospect theory and integrates a probability weighting function with a Bayesian belief update mechanism that refines a probability distribution over possible human models based on exchanged arguments. Through empirical evaluations with human users in an applied argumentation setting, we demonstrate that Persona effectively captures evolving human beliefs, facilitates personalized interactions, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

总结:<br />
本文探讨了紧急响应时间(ERT)对于城市安全的重要性，并指出纽约市医疗ERT在十年间增加了72%。论文通过三个方面提升了应急车辆(EMV)的通行效率和应急服务公平性：1)提出了一种名为EMVLight的分散式多智能体强化学习框架，将EMV路由与交通信号优先权相结合，使EMV旅行时间缩短了42.6%，同时提高了其他车辆的通行效率；2)利用多智能体近似策略优化实现了动态队列跳转车道系统，减少了EMV旅行时间达40%；3)针对纽约市医疗服务的公平性进行了研究，揭示了不同行政区之间的差异，提出了包括优化EMS站点布局和改善交叉口设计在内的解决方案，以缓解如斯塔滕岛因稀疏信号化路口导致的延误及曼哈顿的拥堵问题。这些贡献为政策制定者和城市规划者提供了提升交通安全和效率的新思路。 <div>

Abstract: Emergency Response Time (ERT) is crucial for urban safety, measuring cities' ability to handle medical, fire, and crime emergencies. In NYC, medical ERT increased 72% from 7.89 minutes in 2014 to 14.27 minutes in 2024, with half of delays due to Emergency Vehicle (EMV) travel times. Each minute's delay in stroke response costs 2 million brain cells, while cardiac arrest survival drops 7-10% per minute.
  This dissertation advances EMV facilitation through three contributions. First, EMVLight, a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, integrates EMV routing with traffic signal pre-emption. It achieved 42.6% faster EMV travel times and 23.5% improvement for other vehicles.
  Second, the Dynamic Queue-Jump Lane system uses Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization for coordinated lane-clearing in mixed autonomous and human-driven traffic, reducing EMV travel times by 40%.
  Third, an equity study of NYC Emergency Medical Services revealed disparities across boroughs: Staten Island faces delays due to sparse signalized intersections, while Manhattan struggles with congestion. Solutions include optimized EMS stations and improved intersection designs.
  These contributions enhance EMV mobility and emergency service equity, offering insights for policymakers and urban planners to develop safer, more efficient transportation systems.

Abstract: Semantic Communication is becoming the next pillar in wireless communication technology due to its various capabilities. However, it still encounters various challenging obstacles that need to be solved before real-world deployment. The major challenge is the lack of standardization across different directions, leading to variations in interpretations and objectives. In the survey, we provide detailed explanations of three leading directions in semantic communications, namely Theory of Mind, Generative AI, Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding. These directions have been widely studied, developed, and verified by institutes worldwide, and their effectiveness has increased along with the advancement in technology. We first introduce the concepts and background of these directions. Firstly, we introduce the Theory of Mind, where the communication agents interact with each other, gaining understanding from observations and slowly forming a common language. Secondly, we present generative AI models, which can create new content and offer more freedom to interpret the data beyond the limitation of semantic meaning compression of raw data before transmitting it. The received signal is then decoded by another generative AI model to execute the oriented task. Thirdly, we review deep learning models to jointly optimize the source and channel coding modules. Then, we present a comprehensive survey of existing works in each direction, thereby offering readers an overview of past achievements and potential avenues for further contribution. Moreover, for each direction, we identify and discuss the existing challenges that must be addressed before these approaches can be effectively deployed in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Automating scientific research is considered the final frontier of science. Recently, several papers claim autonomous research agents can generate novel research ideas. Amidst the prevailing optimism, we document a critical concern: a considerable fraction of such research documents are smartly plagiarized. Unlike past efforts where experts evaluate the novelty and feasibility of research ideas, we request $13$ experts to operate under a different situational logic: to identify similarities between LLM-generated research documents and existing work. Concerningly, the experts identify $24\%$ of the $50$ evaluated research documents to be either paraphrased (with one-to-one methodological mapping), or significantly borrowed from existing work. These reported instances are cross-verified by authors of the source papers. Problematically, these LLM-generated research documents do not acknowledge original sources, and bypass inbuilt plagiarism detectors. Lastly, through controlled experiments we show that automated plagiarism detectors are inadequate at catching deliberately plagiarized ideas from an LLM. We recommend a careful assessment of LLM-generated research, and discuss the implications of our findings on research and academic publishing.

总结:
本文提出了一种针对多智能体强化学习（MARL）中协调效率低下的问题的新方法。研究关注于解决并行决策范式下忽略的代理间动作层面的依赖性。为此，文章引入了Action Generation with Plackett-Luce Sampling (AGPS)机制，这是一种用于优化代理决策顺序的新方法，它通过将决策顺序确定任务建模为普拉克特-卢斯采样过程来解决训练过程中排名不稳定性及梯度消失的问题。AGPS通过建立本地观察重要性和决策信用之间的联系，实现基于信用的决策顺序确定。结合Multi-Agent Transformer，作者提出了具有决策顺序优化功能的序列决策制定MARL算法——Prioritized Multi-Agent Transformer (PMAT)。实验结果表明，PMAT在包括StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge、Google Research Football和Multi-Agent MuJoCo等多个基准测试上超越了现有的最优算法，显著提高了协调效率。 <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces challenges in coordinating agents due to complex interdependencies within multi-agent systems. Most MARL algorithms use the simultaneous decision-making paradigm but ignore the action-level dependencies among agents, which reduces coordination efficiency. In contrast, the sequential decision-making paradigm provides finer-grained supervision for agent decision order, presenting the potential for handling dependencies via better decision order management. However, determining the optimal decision order remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce Action Generation with Plackett-Luce Sampling (AGPS), a novel mechanism for agent decision order optimization. We model the order determination task as a Plackett-Luce sampling process to address issues such as ranking instability and vanishing gradient during the network training process. AGPS realizes credit-based decision order determination by establishing a bridge between the significance of agents' local observations and their decision credits, thus facilitating order optimization and dependency management. Integrating AGPS with the Multi-Agent Transformer, we propose the Prioritized Multi-Agent Transformer (PMAT), a sequential decision-making MARL algorithm with decision order optimization. Experiments on benchmarks including StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge, Google Research Football, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo show that PMAT outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, greatly enhancing coordination efficiency.

Abstract: We consider multi-robot systems under recurring tasks formalized as linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. To solve the planning problem efficiently, we propose a bottom-up approach combining offline plan synthesis with online coordination, dynamically adjusting plans via real-time communication. To address action delays, we introduce a synchronization mechanism ensuring coordinated task execution, leading to a multi-agent coordination and synchronization framework that is adaptable to a wide range of multi-robot applications. The software package is developed in Python and ROS2 for broad deployment. We validate our findings through lab experiments involving nine robots showing enhanced adaptability compared to previous methods. Additionally, we conduct simulations with up to ninety agents to demonstrate the reduced computational complexity and the scalability features of our work.

Abstract: Physical contact or proximity is often a necessary condition for the spread of infectious diseases. Common destinations, typically referred to as hubs or points of interest, are arguably the most effective spots for the type of disease spread via airborne transmission. In this work, we model the locations of individuals (agents) and common destinations (hubs) by random spatial point processes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and focus on disease propagation through agents visiting common hubs. The probability of an agent visiting a hub depends on their distance through a connection function $f$. The system is represented by a random bipartite geometric (RBG) graph. We study the degrees and percolation of the RBG graph for general connection functions. We show that the critical density of hubs for percolation is dictated by the support of the connection function $f$, which reveals the critical role of long-distance travel (or its restrictions) in disease spreading.

总结:
该文探讨了在多智能体系统（MAS）中，如何平衡集体一致性与个体多样性的问题。相较于传统基于LLM的MAS依赖于明确的协调机制（如提示或投票），文章提出隐性的共识形成方法——通过信息交换和上下文学习独立决策，可能更适用于需要长期适应性的动态环境，因为它能更好地保持部分多样性并探索新颖策略，增强对外部冲击的应对能力。文中形式化定义了一种共识与多样性之间的权衡，并证明在某些条件下，隐性方法优于显性方法。实验在三个场景（动态灾害响应、信息传播与操纵以及动态公共物品提供）中验证了偏离群体规范的部分多样性可以促进探索、提高韧性和性能。文章强调了通过上下文学习产生的自发协调现象，并指出为了实现有韧性的决策，应重视维持多样性的重要性。 <div>

Abstract: Consensus formation is pivotal in multi-agent systems (MAS), balancing collective coherence with individual diversity. Conventional LLM-based MAS primarily rely on explicit coordination, e.g., prompts or voting, risking premature homogenization. We argue that implicit consensus, where agents exchange information yet independently form decisions via in-context learning, can be more effective in dynamic environments that require long-horizon adaptability. By retaining partial diversity, systems can better explore novel strategies and cope with external shocks. We formalize a consensus-diversity tradeoff, showing conditions where implicit methods outperform explicit ones. Experiments on three scenarios -- Dynamic Disaster Response, Information Spread and Manipulation, and Dynamic Public-Goods Provision -- confirm partial deviation from group norms boosts exploration, robustness, and performance. We highlight emergent coordination via in-context learning, underscoring the value of preserving diversity for resilient decision-making.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything technologies (V2X) have become an ideal paradigm to extend the perception range and see through the occlusion. Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.

总结:
本文探讨了在复杂城市交通网络中，强化学习（RL）作为自适应交通信号控制（ATSC）的一种有前途的数据驱动方法，其中深度神经网络极大地增强了其学习能力。然而，对于涉及多个智能体的ATSC任务，集中式RL由于联合动作空间维度过高而变得不切实际。多智能体RL（MARL）通过将控制权分散到局部RL代理来缓解这一可扩展性问题，但同时也带来了新的挑战，即每个局部代理只能观察到部分环境，因为交叉通信受到限制。文章指出，当无溢流拥堵（无代理间依赖）时，MARL可以通过将问题分解为多个独立强化学习过程来达到全局最优Q值；而在存在溢流拥堵（有代理间依赖）的情况下，则需采用集中式RL以实现最大全球Q值。基于以上结论，文章提出了一种新型动态参数更新策略——深度Q网络-动态参数更新策略（DQN-DPUS），该策略根据智能体之间的依赖动态来更新权重和偏置，即在没有溢流拥堵的情况下仅更新对角子矩阵。实验证明，DQN-DPUS在具有两个交叉口的简单网络下，可在不同交通流量条件下加速收敛速率，同时不影响最优探索性能。实验结果证实了理论发现的有效性，显示了DQN-DPUS在优化交通信号控制方面的优越性。 <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) emerges as a promising data-driven approach for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) in complex urban traffic networks, with deep neural networks substantially augmenting its learning capabilities. However, centralized RL becomes impractical for ATSC involving multiple agents due to the exceedingly high dimensionality of the joint action space. Multi-agent RL (MARL) mitigates this scalability issue by decentralizing control to local RL agents. Nevertheless, this decentralized method introduces new challenges: the environment becomes partially observable from the perspective of each local agent due to constrained inter-agent communication. Both centralized RL and MARL exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses, particularly under heavy intersectional traffic conditions. In this paper, we justify that MARL can achieve the optimal global Q-value by separating into multiple IRL (Independent Reinforcement Learning) processes when no spill-back congestion occurs (no agent dependency) among agents (intersections). In the presence of spill-back congestion (with agent dependency), the maximum global Q-value can be achieved by using centralized RL. Building upon the conclusions, we propose a novel Dynamic Parameter Update Strategy for Deep Q-Network (DQN-DPUS), which updates the weights and bias based on the dependency dynamics among agents, i.e. updating only the diagonal sub-matrices for the scenario without spill-back congestion. We validate the DQN-DPUS in a simple network with two intersections under varying traffic, and show that the proposed strategy can speed up the convergence rate without sacrificing optimal exploration. The results corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the efficacy of DQN-DPUS in optimizing traffic signal control.

Abstract: Current affine formation maneuver of multi-agent systems (MASs) relys on the affine localizability determined by generic assumption for nominal configuration and global construction manner. This does not live up to practical constraints of robot swarms. In this paper, an equilibrium unit based structure is proposed to achieve affine localizability. In an equilibrium unit, existence of non-zero weights between nodes is guaranteed and their summation is proved to be non-zero. To remove the generic assumption, a notion of layerable directed graph is introduced, based on which a sufficient condition associated equilibrium unit is presented to establish affine localizability condition. Within this framework, distributed local construction manner is performed by a designed equilibrium unit construction (EUC) method. With the help of localized communication criterion (LCC) and localized sensing based affine formation maneuver control (LSAFMC) protocol, self-reconstruction capability is possessed by MASs when nodes are added to or removed from the swarms.

Abstract: The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zhao-ht/BioMaze.

Abstract: Recently, Devin has made a significant buzz in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community as the world's first fully autonomous AI software engineer, capable of independently developing software code. Devin uses the concept of agentic workflow in Generative AI (GenAI), which empowers AI agents to engage in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process. In this paper, we present a similar fully autonomous AI formal verification engineer, Saarthi, capable of verifying a given RTL design end-to-end using an agentic workflow. With Saarthi, verification engineers can focus on more complex problems, and verification teams can strive for more ambitious goals. The domain-agnostic implementation of Saarthi makes it scalable for use across various domains such as RTL design, UVM-based verification, and others.

<div> 关键词: 大型语言模型、空间信息表示、决策制定、笛卡尔坐标系、内部激活<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）如何处理和推理空间信息，并通过在网格世界导航任务中对比不同文本空间表示对LLM性能和内部激活的影响。实验表明，使用笛卡尔坐标系的空间表示方法能持续获得更高的成功率和路径效率，且随着模型规模增大，其表现明显提升。此外，通过对LLaMA-3.1-8B进行探查，发现模型中间层存在一些内部单元，它们与空间特征（如：代理人在网格中的位置或动作正确性）有稳健的相关性，且这些单元在处理不相关的空间推理任务时也会被激活。这项工作深化了我们对LLMs处理空间信息的理解，并为构建更可解释和健壮的智能代理系统提供了有价值的见解。 <div>

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) represent and reason about spatial information is crucial for building robust agentic systems that can navigate real and simulated environments. In this work, we investigate the influence of different text-based spatial representations on LLM performance and internal activations in a grid-world navigation task. By evaluating models of various sizes on a task that requires navigating toward a goal, we examine how the format used to encode spatial information impacts decision-making. Our experiments reveal that cartesian representations of space consistently yield higher success rates and path efficiency, with performance scaling markedly with model size. Moreover, probing LLaMA-3.1-8B revealed subsets of internal units, primarily located in intermediate layers, that robustly correlate with spatial features, such as the position of the agent in the grid or action correctness, regardless of how that information is represented, and are also activated by unrelated spatial reasoning tasks. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs process spatial information and provides valuable insights for developing more interpretable and robust agentic AI systems.

<div> 关键词：深度强化学习(DRL)、对抗性攻击、内在状态对抗性马尔可夫决策过程(ISA-MDP)、最优鲁棒策略(ORP)、一致对抗鲁棒强化学习(CAR-RL)

总结:
本文探讨了确保深度强化学习(DRL)代理对对抗性攻击的鲁棒性的重要性。研究提出了内在状态对抗性马尔可夫决策过程(ISA-MDP)的新概念，该框架下，敌人无法从根本上改变状态观测的本质。理论证明在ISA-MDP中存在确定性和稳态的ORP，并与贝尔曼最优策略相吻合，揭示提高DRL鲁棒性不一定牺牲自然环境下的性能。文章还指出，以前依赖于1度量误差的DRL算法存在脆弱性，实现ORP需要无穷度量误差(IME)。为此，文章提出了一致对抗鲁棒强化学习(CAR-RL)框架，通过优化IME的近似值进行优化，并将其应用于价值基础和策略基础的DRL算法上，实验结果验证了理论分析并取得了优越性能。 <div>

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents against adversarial attacks is critical for their trustworthy deployment. Recent research highlights the challenges of achieving state-adversarial robustness and suggests that an optimal robust policy (ORP) does not always exist, complicating the enforcement of strict robustness constraints. In this paper, we further explore the concept of ORP. We first introduce the Intrinsic State-adversarial Markov Decision Process (ISA-MDP), a novel formulation where adversaries cannot fundamentally alter the intrinsic nature of state observations. ISA-MDP, supported by empirical and theoretical evidence, universally characterizes decision-making under state-adversarial paradigms. We rigorously prove that within ISA-MDP, a deterministic and stationary ORP exists, aligning with the Bellman optimal policy. Our findings theoretically reveal that improving DRL robustness does not necessarily compromise performance in natural environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate the necessity of infinity measurement error (IME) in both $Q$-function and probability spaces to achieve ORP, unveiling vulnerabilities of previous DRL algorithms that rely on $1$-measurement errors. Motivated by these insights, we develop the Consistent Adversarial Robust Reinforcement Learning (CAR-RL) framework, which optimizes surrogates of IME. We apply CAR-RL to both value-based and policy-based DRL algorithms, achieving superior performance and validating our theoretical analysis.

<div> 关键词: 自主AI代理、大型语言模型、安全威胁、防御方案、反狱破系统

总结:
本文关注的是自主AI代理使用大型语言模型所面临的不可忽视的安全威胁问题。现有的静态防护措施对于多模态高级攻击（如多轮越狱和欺骗性对齐）无法有效抵御。研究指出，急需开发新的评估框架来识别并对抗这些威胁，确保安全部署。文章提出的方法包括通过逆向图灵测试检测恶意代理、利用多智能体模拟分析欺骗性对齐，并设计了一种反狱破系统，通过工具介导的对抗性场景测试了GEMINI 1.5 pro和llama-3.3-70B、deepseek r1等模型。虽然检测准确率高达94%，但当攻击提示长度增加时，系统的脆弱性显现，攻击成功率提高，多样性指标预测失效，暴露出多个复杂系统故障。因此，论文强调了采用基于主动监控的灵活安全系统的重要性，需要由代理自身与系统管理员适应性干预相结合，以应对当前模型可能产生的安全隐患。最终，作者提出一套全面的框架来解决这些问题。 <div>

Abstract: The autonomous AI agents using large language models can create undeniable values in all span of the society but they face security threats from adversaries that warrants immediate protective solutions because trust and safety issues arise. Considering the many-shot jailbreaking and deceptive alignment as some of the main advanced attacks, that cannot be mitigated by the static guardrails used during the supervised training, points out a crucial research priority for real world robustness. The combination of static guardrails in dynamic multi-agent system fails to defend against those attacks. We intend to enhance security for LLM-based agents through the development of new evaluation frameworks which identify and counter threats for safe operational deployment. Our work uses three examination methods to detect rogue agents through a Reverse Turing Test and analyze deceptive alignment through multi-agent simulations and develops an anti-jailbreaking system by testing it with GEMINI 1.5 pro and llama-3.3-70B, deepseek r1 models using tool-mediated adversarial scenarios. The detection capabilities are strong such as 94\% accuracy for GEMINI 1.5 pro yet the system suffers persistent vulnerabilities when under long attacks as prompt length increases attack success rates (ASR) and diversity metrics become ineffective in prediction while revealing multiple complex system faults. The findings demonstrate the necessity of adopting flexible security systems based on active monitoring that can be performed by the agents themselves together with adaptable interventions by system admin as the current models can create vulnerabilities that can lead to the unreliable and vulnerable system. So, in our work, we try to address such situations and propose a comprehensive framework to counteract the security issues.

Abstract: A tenet of reinforcement learning is that rewards are always observed by the agent. However, this is not true in many realistic settings, e.g., a human observer may not always be able to provide rewards, a sensor to observe rewards may be limited or broken, or rewards may be unavailable during deployment. Monitored Markov decision processes (Mon-MDPs) have recently been proposed as a model of such settings. Yet, Mon-MDP algorithms developed thus far do not fully exploit the problem structure, cannot take advantage of a known monitor, have no worst-case guarantees for ``unsolvable'' Mon-MDPs without specific initialization, and only have asymptotic proofs of convergence. This paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce a model-based algorithm for Mon-MDPs that addresses all of these shortcomings. The algorithm uses two instances of model-based interval estimation, one to guarantee that observable rewards are indeed observed, and another to learn the optimal policy. Second, empirical results demonstrate these advantages, showing faster convergence than prior algorithms in over two dozen benchmark settings, and even more dramatic improvements when the monitor process is known. Third, we present the first finite-sample bound on performance and show convergence to an optimal worst-case policy when some rewards are never observable.

Abstract: Alpha mining, a critical component in quantitative investment, focuses on discovering predictive signals for future asset returns in increasingly complex financial markets. However, the pervasive issue of alpha decay, where factors lose their predictive power over time, poses a significant challenge for alpha mining. Traditional methods like genetic programming face rapid alpha decay from overfitting and complexity, while approaches driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their promise, often rely too heavily on existing knowledge, creating homogeneous factors that worsen crowding and accelerate decay. To address this challenge, we propose AlphaAgent, an autonomous framework that effectively integrates LLM agents with ad hoc regularizations for mining decay-resistant alpha factors. AlphaAgent employs three key mechanisms: (i) originality enforcement through a similarity measure based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs) against existing alphas, (ii) hypothesis-factor alignment via LLM-evaluated semantic consistency between market hypotheses and generated factors, and (iii) complexity control via AST-based structural constraints, preventing over-engineered constructions that are prone to overfitting. These mechanisms collectively guide the alpha generation process to balance originality, financial rationale, and adaptability to evolving market conditions, mitigating the risk of alpha decay. Extensive evaluations show that AlphaAgent outperforms traditional and LLM-based methods in mitigating alpha decay across bull and bear markets, consistently delivering significant alpha in Chinese CSI 500 and US S&amp;P 500 markets over the past four years. Notably, AlphaAgent showcases remarkable resistance to alpha decay, elevating the potential for yielding powerful factors.

Abstract: Mobile phone agents can assist people in automating daily tasks on their phones, which have emerged as a pivotal research spotlight. However, existing procedure-oriented agents struggle with cross-app instructions, due to the following challenges: (1) complex task relationships, (2) diverse app environment, and (3) error propagation and information loss in multi-step execution. Drawing inspiration from object-oriented programming principles, we recognize that object-oriented solutions is more suitable for cross-app instruction. To address these challenges, we propose a self-evolving multi-agent framework named MobileSteward, which integrates multiple app-oriented StaffAgents coordinated by a centralized StewardAgent. We design three specialized modules in MobileSteward: (1) Dynamic Recruitment generates a scheduling graph guided by information flow to explicitly associate tasks among apps. (2) Assigned Execution assigns the task to app-oriented StaffAgents, each equipped with app-specialized expertise to address the diversity between apps. (3) Adjusted Evaluation conducts evaluation to provide reflection tips or deliver key information, which alleviates error propagation and information loss during multi-step execution. To continuously improve the performance of MobileSteward, we develop a Memory-based Self-evolution mechanism, which summarizes the experience from successful execution, to improve the performance of MobileSteward. We establish the first English Cross-APP Benchmark (CAPBench) in the real-world environment to evaluate the agents' capabilities of solving complex cross-app instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that MobileSteward achieves the best performance compared to both single-agent and multi-agent frameworks, highlighting the superiority of MobileSteward in better handling user instructions with diverse complexity.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) are revolutionizing transportation by reducing human intervention, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing safety. Large Language Models (LLMs), known for their exceptional planning and reasoning capabilities, have been integrated into ADSs to assist with driving decision-making. However, LLM-based single-agent ADSs face three major challenges: limited perception, insufficient collaboration, and high computational demands. To address these issues, recent advancements in LLM-based multi-agent ADSs have focused on improving inter-agent communication and cooperation. This paper provides a frontier survey of LLM-based multi-agent ADSs. We begin with a background introduction to related concepts, followed by a categorization of existing LLM-based approaches based on different agent interaction modes. We then discuss agent-human interactions in scenarios where LLM-based agents engage with humans. Finally, we summarize key applications, datasets, and challenges in this field to support future research (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-based_Multi-agent_ADS-3A5C/README.md).

Abstract: This paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of persuasive and grounded marketing content, using real estate listing descriptions as our focal application domain. Our method is designed to align the generated content with user preferences while highlighting useful factual attributes. This agent consists of three key modules: (1) Grounding Module, mimicking expert human behavior to predict marketable features; (2) Personalization Module, aligning content with user preferences; (3) Marketing Module, ensuring factual accuracy and the inclusion of localized features. We conduct systematic human-subject experiments in the domain of real estate marketing, with a focus group of potential house buyers. The results demonstrate that marketing descriptions generated by our approach are preferred over those written by human experts by a clear margin. Our findings suggest a promising LLM-based agentic framework to automate large-scale targeted marketing while ensuring responsible generation using only facts.

Abstract: Recent work, spanning from autonomous vehicle coordination to in-space assembly, has shown the importance of learning collaborative behavior for enabling robots to achieve shared goals. A common approach for learning this cooperative behavior is to utilize the centralized-training decentralized-execution paradigm. However, this approach also introduces a new challenge: how do we evaluate the contributions of each agent's actions to the overall success or failure of the team. This credit assignment problem has remained open, and has been extensively studied in the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning literature. In fact, humans manually inspecting agent behavior often generate better credit evaluations than existing methods. We combine this observation with recent works which show Large Language Models demonstrate human-level performance at many pattern recognition tasks. Our key idea is to reformulate credit assignment to the two pattern recognition problems of sequence improvement and attribution, which motivates our novel LLM-MCA method. Our approach utilizes a centralized LLM reward-critic which numerically decomposes the environment reward based on the individualized contribution of each agent in the scenario. We then update the agents' policy networks based on this feedback. We also propose an extension LLM-TACA where our LLM critic performs explicit task assignment by passing an intermediary goal directly to each agent policy in the scenario. Both our methods far outperform the state-of-the-art on a variety of benchmarks, including Level-Based Foraging, Robotic Warehouse, and our new Spaceworld benchmark which incorporates collision-related safety constraints. As an artifact of our methods, we generate large trajectory datasets with each timestep annotated with per-agent reward information, as sampled from our LLM critics.

Abstract: The increasing complexity and scale of modern telecommunications networks demand intelligent automation to enhance efficiency, adaptability, and resilience. Agentic AI has emerged as a key paradigm for intelligent communications and networking, enabling AI-driven agents to perceive, reason, decide, and act within dynamic networking environments. However, effective decision-making in telecom applications, such as network planning, management, and resource allocation, requires integrating retrieval mechanisms that support multi-hop reasoning, historical cross-referencing, and compliance with evolving 3GPP standards. This article presents a forward-looking perspective on generative information retrieval-inspired intelligent communications and networking, emphasizing the role of knowledge acquisition, processing, and retrieval in agentic AI for telecom systems. We first provide a comprehensive review of generative information retrieval strategies, including traditional retrieval, hybrid retrieval, semantic retrieval, knowledge-based retrieval, and agentic contextual retrieval. We then analyze their advantages, limitations, and suitability for various networking scenarios. Next, we present a survey about their applications in communications and networking. Additionally, we introduce an agentic contextual retrieval framework to enhance telecom-specific planning by integrating multi-source retrieval, structured reasoning, and self-reflective validation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves answer accuracy, explanation consistency, and retrieval efficiency compared to traditional and semantic retrieval methods. Finally, we outline future research directions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in tasks such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and autonomous AI agent workflows. Yet, when faced with large sets of unstructured documents requiring progressive exploration, analysis, and synthesis, such as conducting literature survey, existing approaches often fall short. We address this challenge -- termed Progressive Document Investigation -- by introducing Graphy, an end-to-end platform that automates data modeling, exploration and high-quality report generation in a user-friendly manner. Graphy comprises an offline Scrapper that transforms raw documents into a structured graph of Fact and Dimension nodes, and an online Surveyor that enables iterative exploration and LLM-driven report generation. We showcase a pre-scrapped graph of over 50,000 papers -- complete with their references -- demonstrating how Graphy facilitates the literature-survey scenario.

Abstract: This paper pioneers a novel approach to economic and public policy analysis by leveraging multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) as heterogeneous artificial economic agents. We first evaluate five LLMs' economic decision-making capabilities in solving two-period consumption allocation problems under two distinct scenarios: with explicit utility functions and based on intuitive reasoning. While previous research has often simulated heterogeneity by solely varying prompts, our approach harnesses the inherent variations in analytical capabilities across different LLMs to model agents with diverse cognitive traits. Building on these findings, we construct a Multi-LLM-Agent-Based (MLAB) framework by mapping these LLMs to specific educational groups and corresponding income brackets. Using interest-income taxation as a case study, we demonstrate how the MLAB framework can simulate policy impacts across heterogeneous agents, offering a promising new direction for economic and public policy analysis by leveraging LLMs' human-like reasoning capabilities and computational power.

<div> 关键词: 分布式方法、通信开销、压缩、随机梯度下降、噪声鲁棒性

总结:
本文研究了在处理大规模机器学习流程中分布式压缩方法的重要性以及它们面临的通信开销问题。文章重点关注了两种分布式压缩算法——分布式压缩SGD (DCSGD) 和分布式SignSGD (DSignSGD)，并利用随机微分方程对其在存在大量和重尾梯度噪声情况下的性能进行了分析。结果表明，DCSGD在应对无偏压缩下的随机梯度噪声时较为脆弱，而DSignSGD即使在大型和重尾噪声环境下仍能保持鲁棒性。此外，文中还提出了新的超参数调整规则以缓解压缩导致的性能退化。这些发现通过多个深度学习架构和数据集的实验证明，并为分布式优化提供了实用建议。 <div>

Abstract: Distributed methods are essential for handling machine learning pipelines comprising large-scale models and datasets. However, their benefits often come at the cost of increased communication overhead between the central server and agents, which can become the main bottleneck, making training costly or even unfeasible in such systems. Compression methods such as quantization and sparsification can alleviate this issue. Still, their robustness to large and heavy-tailed gradient noise, a phenomenon sometimes observed in language modeling, remains poorly understood. This work addresses this gap by analyzing Distributed Compressed SGD (DCSGD) and Distributed SignSGD (DSignSGD) using stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Our results show that DCSGD with unbiased compression is more vulnerable to noise in stochastic gradients, while DSignSGD remains robust, even under large and heavy-tailed noise. Additionally, we propose new scaling rules for hyperparameter tuning to mitigate performance degradation due to compression. These findings are empirically validated across multiple deep learning architectures and datasets, providing practical recommendations for distributed optimization.

Abstract: To develop generalizable models in multi-agent reinforcement learning, recent approaches have been devoted to discovering task-independent skills for each agent, which generalize across tasks and facilitate agents' cooperation. However, particularly in partially observed settings, such approaches struggle with sample efficiency and generalization capabilities due to two primary challenges: (a) How to incorporate global states into coordinating the skills of different agents? (b) How to learn generalizable and consistent skill semantics when each agent only receives partial observations? To address these challenges, we propose a framework called \textbf{M}asked \textbf{A}utoencoders for \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{A}gent \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning (MA2RL), which encourages agents to infer unobserved entities by reconstructing entity-states from the entity perspective. The entity perspective helps MA2RL generalize to diverse tasks with varying agent numbers and action spaces. Specifically, we treat local entity-observations as masked contexts of the global entity-states, and MA2RL can infer the latent representation of dynamically masked entities, facilitating the assignment of task-independent skills and the learning of skill semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MA2RL achieves significant improvements relative to state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating extraordinary performance, remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities and advantageous transferability.

Abstract: In recent years, the exceptional performance of generative models in generative tasks has sparked significant interest in their integration into decision-making processes. Due to their ability to handle complex data distributions and their strong model capacity, generative models can be effectively incorporated into decision-making systems by generating trajectories that guide agents toward high-reward state-action regions or intermediate sub-goals. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the application of generative models in decision-making tasks. We classify seven fundamental types of generative models: energy-based models, generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, diffusion models, generative flow networks, and autoregressive models. Regarding their applications, we categorize their functions into three main roles: controllers, modelers and optimizers, and discuss how each role contributes to decision-making. Furthermore, we examine the deployment of these models across five critical real-world decision-making scenarios. Finally, we summarize the strengths and limitations of current approaches and propose three key directions for advancing next-generation generative directive models: high-performance algorithms, large-scale generalized decision-making models, and self-evolving and adaptive models.

Abstract: The rapid increase in mobile device usage necessitates improved automation for seamless task management. However, many AI-driven frameworks struggle due to insufficient operational knowledge. Manually written knowledge helps but is labor-intensive and inefficient. To address these challenges, we introduce Mobile-Agent-V, a framework that leverages video guidance to provide rich and cost-effective operational knowledge for mobile automation. Mobile-Agent-V enhances task execution capabilities by leveraging video inputs without requiring specialized sampling or preprocessing. Mobile-Agent-V integrates a sliding window strategy and incorporates a video agent and deep-reflection agent to ensure that actions align with user instructions. Through this innovative approach, users can record task processes with guidance, enabling the system to autonomously learn and execute tasks efficiently. Experimental results show that Mobile-Agent-V achieves a 30% performance improvement compared to existing frameworks.

Abstract: The Metaverse holds the potential to revolutionize digital interactions through the establishment of a highly dynamic and immersive virtual realm over wireless communications systems, offering services such as massive twinning and telepresence. This landscape presents novel challenges, particularly efficient management of multiple access to the frequency spectrum, for which numerous adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches have been explored. However, challenges persist in adapting agents to heterogeneous and non-stationary wireless environments. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages Continual Learning (CL) to enhance intelligent Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, featuring an intelligent agent coexisting with legacy User Equipments (UEs) with varying numbers, protocols, and transmission profiles unknown to the agent for the sake of backward compatibility and privacy. We introduce an adaptive Double and Dueling Deep Q-Learning (D3QL)-based MAC protocol, enriched by a symmetry-aware CL mechanism, which maximizes intelligent agent throughput while ensuring fairness. Mathematical analysis validates the efficiency of our proposed scheme, showcasing superiority over conventional DRL-based techniques in terms of throughput, collision rate, and fairness, coupled with real-time responsiveness in highly dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Affective computing has made significant strides in emotion recognition and generation, yet current approaches mainly focus on short-term pattern recognition and lack a comprehensive framework to guide affective agents toward long-term human well-being. To address this, we propose a teleology-driven affective computing framework that unifies major emotion theories (basic emotion, appraisal, and constructivist approaches) under the premise that affect is an adaptive, goal-directed process that facilitates survival and development. Our framework emphasizes aligning agent responses with both personal/individual and group/collective well-being over extended timescales. We advocate for creating a "dataverse" of personal affective events, capturing the interplay between beliefs, goals, actions, and outcomes through real-world experience sampling and immersive virtual reality. By leveraging causal modeling, this "dataverse" enables AI systems to infer individuals' unique affective concerns and provide tailored interventions for sustained well-being. Additionally, we introduce a meta-reinforcement learning paradigm to train agents in simulated environments, allowing them to adapt to evolving affective concerns and balance hierarchical goals - from immediate emotional needs to long-term self-actualization. This framework shifts the focus from statistical correlations to causal reasoning, enhancing agents' ability to predict and respond proactively to emotional challenges, and offers a foundation for developing personalized, ethically aligned affective systems that promote meaningful human-AI interactions and societal well-being.

Abstract: Strategic mining attacks, such as selfish mining, exploit blockchain consensus protocols by deviating from honest behavior to maximize rewards. Markov Decision Process (MDP) analysis faces scalability challenges in modern digital economics, including blockchain. To address these limitations, reinforcement learning (RL) provides a scalable alternative, enabling adaptive strategy optimization in complex dynamic environments.
  In this survey, we examine RL's role in strategic mining analysis, comparing it to MDP-based approaches. We begin by reviewing foundational MDP models and their limitations, before exploring RL frameworks that can learn near-optimal strategies across various protocols. Building on this analysis, we compare RL techniques and their effectiveness in deriving security thresholds, such as the minimum attacker power required for profitable attacks. Expanding the discussion further, we classify consensus protocols and propose open challenges, such as multi-agent dynamics and real-world validation.
  This survey highlights the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of selfish mining, including protocol design, threat detection, and security analysis, while offering a strategic roadmap for researchers in decentralized systems and AI-driven analytics.

Abstract: Automated service agents require well-structured workflows to provide consistent and accurate responses to customer queries. However, these workflows are often undocumented, and their automatic extraction from conversations remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel framework for extracting and evaluating dialog workflows from historical interactions. Our extraction process consists of two key stages: (1) a retrieval step to select relevant conversations based on key procedural elements, and (2) a structured workflow generation process using a question-answer-based chain-of-thought (QA-CoT) prompting. To comprehensively assess the quality of extracted workflows, we introduce an automated agent and customer bots simulation framework that measures their effectiveness in resolving customer issues. Extensive experiments on the ABCD and SynthABCD datasets demonstrate that our QA-CoT technique improves workflow extraction by 12.16\% in average macro accuracy over the baseline. Moreover, our evaluation method closely aligns with human assessments, providing a reliable and scalable framework for future research.

Abstract: To guarantee global coverage and ubiquitous connectivity, the Non-terrestrial Network (NTN) technology has been regarded as a key enabling technology in the Six Generation (6G) network, which consists of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), high-altitude platform (HAP), and satellite. It is noted that the unique characteristics of various NTN platforms directly impact the design and implementation of NTNs, which results in highly dynamic and heterogeneous networks. Even within the same tier, such as the space tier, the NTNs are developed based on different platforms including Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO). Therefore, distributed coordination among heterogeneous NTNs remains an important challenge. Although distributed learning framework finds a wide range of applications by leveraging rich distributed data and computation resources. The explicit and systematic analysis of the individual layers' challenges, and corresponding distributed coordination solutions in heterogeneous NTNs has not been proposed yet. In this article, we first summarize the unique characteristics of each NTN platform, and analyze the corresponding impact on the design and implementation of the NTN. We then identify the communication challenges of heterogeneous NTNs in individual layers, where the potential coordinated solutions are identified. We further illustrate the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithms tailored for coordinated solutions in heterogeneous NTNs. Last but not least, we present a case study of the user scheduling optimization problem in heterogeneous UAVs-based cellular networks, where the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) technique is developed to validate the effectiveness of distributed coordination in heterogeneous NTNs.

Abstract: This paper investigates an open research challenge of reconstructing high-quality, large 3D open scenes from images. It is observed existing methods have various limitations, such as requiring precise camera poses for input and dense viewpoints for supervision. To perform effective and efficient 3D scene reconstruction, we propose a novel graph-guided 3D scene reconstruction framework, GraphGS. Specifically, given a set of images captured by RGB cameras on a scene, we first design a spatial prior-based scene structure estimation method. This is then used to create a camera graph that includes information about the camera topology. Further, we propose to apply the graph-guided multi-view consistency constraint and adaptive sampling strategy to the 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization process. This greatly alleviates the issue of Gaussian points overfitting to specific sparse viewpoints and expedites the 3D reconstruction process. We demonstrate GraphGS achieves high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from images, which presents state-of-the-art performance through quantitative and qualitative evaluation across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Current financial LLM agent benchmarks are inadequate. They prioritize task performance while ignoring fundamental safety risks. Threats like hallucinations, temporal misalignment, and adversarial vulnerabilities pose systemic risks in high-stakes financial environments, yet existing evaluation frameworks fail to capture these risks. We take a firm position: traditional benchmarks are insufficient to ensure the reliability of LLM agents in finance. To address this, we analyze existing financial LLM agent benchmarks, finding safety gaps and introducing ten risk-aware evaluation metrics. Through an empirical evaluation of both API-based and open-weight LLM agents, we reveal hidden vulnerabilities that remain undetected by conventional assessments. To move the field forward, we propose the Safety-Aware Evaluation Agent (SAEA), grounded in a three-level evaluation framework that assesses agents at the model level (intrinsic capabilities), workflow level (multi-step process reliability), and system level (integration robustness). Our findings highlight the urgent need to redefine LLM agent evaluation standards by shifting the focus from raw performance to safety, robustness, and real world resilience.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is concerned with how intelligence agents take actions in a given environment to maximize the cumulative reward they receive. In healthcare, applying RL algorithms could assist patients in improving their health status. In ride-sharing platforms, applying RL algorithms could increase drivers' income and customer satisfaction. Over the past decade, RL has been arguably one of the most vibrant research frontiers in machine learning. Nevertheless, statistics as a field, as opposed to computer science, has only recently begun to engage with RL both in depth and in breadth. This paper present a selective review of statistical inferential tools for RL, covering both hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction. Our goal is to highlight the value of statistical inference in RL for both the statistics and machine learning communities, and to promote the broader application of classical statistical inference tools in this vibrant area of research.

Abstract: What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.

总结:

本文旨在探索适用于两维NACA 0012翼型在雷诺数为3000条件下的新型主动流动控制(AFC)技术以减小分离。研究采用深度强化学习(DRL)框架确定施加于流场的动作策略，这些动作涉及在翼型表面通过喷气实现吹吸控制。流动使用低耗散有限元代码Alya进行模拟，并在高性能计算系统上运行。通过DRL得到的各种控制策略实现了高达43.9%的拖力减少或提高了58.6%的空气动力效率。相比之下，周期性控制策略表现出较低的能量效率，未能达到与DRL方法相当的空气动力学改善水平。这些增益是通过在翼型上实施动态、闭环、时间依赖的主动控制机制来实现的。 <div>

Abstract: The aim of this study is to discover new active-flow-control (AFC) techniques for separation mitigation in a two-dimensional NACA 0012 airfoil at a Reynolds number of 3000. To find these AFC strategies, a framework consisting of a deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) agent has been used to determine the action strategies to apply to the flow. The actions involve blowing and suction through jets at the airfoil surface. The flow is simulated with the numerical code Alya, which is a low-dissipation finite-element code, on a high-performance computing system. Various control strategies obtained through DRL led to 43.9% drag reduction, while others yielded an increase in aerodynamic efficiency of 58.6%. In comparison, periodic-control strategies demonstrated lower energy efficiency while failing to achieve the same level of aerodynamic improvements as the DRL-based approach. These gains have been attained through the implementation of a dynamic, closed-loop, time-dependent, active control mechanism over the airfoil.

Abstract: We study a natural competitive-information-design strategic variant for the celebrated Pandora's Box problem (Weitzman, 1979), where each box is associated with a strategic information sender who can design what information about the box's prize value to be revealed to the agent when the agent inspects the box. This variant with strategic boxes is motivated by a wide range of real-world economic applications for Pandora's Box. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) given the boxes' information policies, we characterize the agent's optimal search and stopping strategy; (2) we fully characterize the pure symmetric equilibrium for the game of boxes' competitive information revelation in a symmetric environment; and (3) we reveal various insights regarding information competition and the resultant agent payoff at equilibrium, and additionally, we study informational properties of Pandora's Box by establishing an intrinsic connection between informativeness of any box's value distribution and the utility order of the search agent.

总结:

本文提出了一种新的高效且有效的无监督跨域强化学习（RL）预训练框架——CRPTpro。该框架旨在解决持续性视觉控制中的挑战问题。CRPTpro将数据采样与编码器预训练解耦，通过解耦随机收集方法生成适合跨域预训练的数据集。此外，它还引入了一种基于原型的新型自我监督算法，用于预训练能够在不同领域通用的有效视觉编码器。无需微调，该跨域编码器即可应用于定义在不同领域的具有挑战性的下游任务中。相较于近期先进的方法，CRPTpro在不需额外训练探索代理进行数据收集的情况下，实现了下游策略学习更好的性能，大大减轻了预训练的负担。实验在包括平衡控制、机器人移动和操作在内的八个连续视觉控制领域进行了广泛验证，CRPTpro在12个跨域下游任务中的11项上显著优于Proto-RL(C)，并且仅使用了54.5%的墙钟预训练时间。相关实现可在https://github.com/liuxin0824/CRPTpro获取。 <div>

Abstract: This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible. Unsupervised cross-domain Reinforcement Learning (RL) pre-training shows great potential for challenging continuous visual control but poses a big challenge. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ross-domain \textbf{R}andom \textbf{P}re-\textbf{T}raining with \textbf{pro}totypes (CRPTpro), a novel, efficient, and effective self-supervised cross-domain RL pre-training framework. CRPTpro decouples data sampling from encoder pre-training, proposing decoupled random collection to easily and quickly generate a qualified cross-domain pre-training dataset. Moreover, a novel prototypical self-supervised algorithm is proposed to pre-train an effective visual encoder that is generic across different domains. Without finetuning, the cross-domain encoder can be implemented for challenging downstream tasks defined in different domains, either seen or unseen. Compared with recent advanced methods, CRPTpro achieves better performance on downstream policy learning without extra training on exploration agents for data collection, greatly reducing the burden of pre-training. We conduct extensive experiments across eight challenging continuous visual-control domains, including balance control, robot locomotion, and manipulation. CRPTpro significantly outperforms the next best Proto-RL(C) on 11/12 cross-domain downstream tasks with only 54.5\% wall-clock pre-training time,\footnote{Implementation: https://github.com/liuxin0824/CRPTpro} exhibiting state-of-the-art pre-training performance with greatly improved pre-training efficiency.

Abstract: This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible. Unsupervised skill discovery seeks to acquire different useful skills without extrinsic reward via unsupervised Reinforcement Learning (RL), with the discovered skills efficiently adapting to multiple downstream tasks in various ways. However, recent advanced skill discovery methods struggle to well balance state exploration and skill diversity, particularly when the potential skills are rich and hard to discern. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive dyna\textbf{m}ic \textbf{S}kill \textbf{D}iscovery \textbf{(ComSD)}\footnote{Code and videos: https://github.com/liuxin0824/ComSD} which generates diverse and exploratory unsupervised skills through a novel intrinsic incentive, named contrastive dynamic reward. It contains a particle-based exploration reward to make agents access far-reaching states for exploratory skill acquisition, and a novel contrastive diversity reward to promote the discriminability between different skills. Moreover, a novel dynamic weighting mechanism between the above two rewards is proposed to balance state exploration and skill diversity, which further enhances the quality of the discovered skills. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that ComSD can generate diverse behaviors at different exploratory levels for multi-joint robots, enabling state-of-the-art adaptation performance on challenging downstream tasks. It can also discover distinguishable and far-reaching exploration skills in the challenging tree-like 2D maze.

<div> 关键词: 在线适应性、离线强化学习、多智能体强化学习、变压器架构、自确认均衡

<br /><br />总结:
本文探讨了在多智能体强化学习（MARL）中，离线强化学习面临的在线环境与离线数据集之间的分布偏移问题，特别是在应对非站态对手时的挑战。为此，研究提出了基于变压器的自我确认变换器（SCT）方法，旨在通过自动回归训练赋予变压器模型在线适应非站态对手的能力。该方法使变压器代理在离线阶段学习预测对手行为，并在部署到在线环境中时，将这种虚构的对手游戏（信念）反馈给模型，结合其他环境信息生成后续动作。SCT的训练损失由信念一致性损失和最佳响应损失组成，前者要求信念匹配对手的实际行动，后者要求代理在信念下表现出最优行为。实验结果显示，SCT在结构化的重复囚徒困境游戏中展示了信念一致性和均衡行为，并在更复杂的多粒子环境中展现出优于先前变压器模型和离线MARL基线的表现。 <div>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from the distribution shift between the offline dataset and the online environment. In multi-agent RL (MARL), this distribution shift may arise from the nonstationary opponents in the online testing who display distinct behaviors from those recorded in the offline dataset. Hence, the key to the broader deployment of offline MARL is the online adaptation to nonstationary opponents. Recent advances in foundation models, e.g., large language models, have demonstrated the generalization ability of the transformer, an emerging neural network architecture, in sequence modeling, of which offline RL is a special case. One naturally wonders \textit{whether offline-trained transformer-based RL policies adapt to nonstationary opponents online}. We propose a novel auto-regressive training to equip transformer agents with online adaptability based on the idea of self-augmented pre-conditioning. The transformer agent first learns offline to predict the opponent's action based on past observations. When deployed online, such a fictitious opponent play, referred to as the belief, is fed back to the transformer, together with other environmental feedback, to generate future actions conditional on the belief. Motivated by self-confirming equilibrium in game theory, the training loss consists of belief consistency loss, requiring the beliefs to match the opponent's actual actions and best response loss, mandating the agent to behave optimally under the belief. We evaluate the online adaptability of the proposed self-confirming transformer (SCT) in a structured environment, iterated prisoner's dilemma games, to demonstrate SCT's belief consistency and equilibrium behaviors as well as more involved multi-particle environments to showcase its superior performance against nonstationary opponents over prior transformers and offline MARL baselines.

Abstract: Developing AI agents capable of interacting with open-world environments to solve diverse tasks is a compelling challenge. However, evaluating such open-ended agents remains difficult, with current benchmarks facing scalability limitations. To address this, we introduce Minecraft Universe (MCU), a comprehensive evaluation framework set within the open-world video game Minecraft. MCU incorporates three key components: (1) an expanding collection of 3,452 composable atomic tasks that encompasses 11 major categories and 41 subcategories of challenges; (2) a task composition mechanism capable of generating infinite diverse tasks with varying difficulty; and (3) a general evaluation framework that achieves 91.5% alignment with human ratings for open-ended task assessment. Empirical results reveal that even state-of-the-art foundation agents struggle with the increasing diversity and complexity of tasks. These findings highlight the necessity of MCU as a robust benchmark to drive progress in AI agent development within open-ended environments.

Abstract: We explore the creative problem-solving capabilities of modern LLMs in a novel constrained setting. To this end, we create MACGYVER, an automatically generated dataset consisting of over 1,600 real-world problems deliberately designed to trigger innovative usage of objects and necessitate out-of-the-box thinking. We then present our collection to both LLMs and humans to compare and contrast their problem-solving abilities. MACGYVER is challenging for both groups, but in unique and complementary ways. For instance, humans excel in tasks they are familiar with but struggle with domain-specific knowledge, leading to a higher variance. In contrast, LLMs, exposed to a variety of specialized knowledge, attempt broader problems but fail by proposing physically-infeasible actions. Finally, we provide a detailed error analysis of LLMs, and demonstrate the potential of enhancing their problem-solving ability with novel prompting techniques such as iterative step-wise reflection and divergent-convergent thinking.
  This work (1) introduces a fresh arena for intelligent agents focusing on intricate aspects of physical reasoning, planning, and unconventional thinking, which supplements the existing spectrum of machine intelligence; and (2) provides insight into the constrained problem-solving capabilities of both humans and AI.

总结:
在大规模联邦学习和去中心化学习中，通信效率是一个主要挑战。文章关注于gossip通信，虽然它比与远程服务器通信更为成本效益，但在大型稀疏网络中可能需要更多通信轮次。为了解决这一权衡问题，研究者考察了一种半分布式通信协议，其中代理可以以概率性的方式进行代理间和代理与服务器间的通信。为此，他们设计了一个针对半分布式网络的通信效率优化算法——PISCO，该算法利用梯度跟踪技术继承了对数据异质性的鲁棒性，并允许多次局部更新以节省通信资源。文章证明了PISCO对于非凸问题的收敛率，并展示其能在代理人数量和局部更新次数方面实现线性加速。数值实验结果显示，PISCO具有出色的通信效率以及对数据异质性和各种网络拓扑结构的适应性。 <div>

Abstract: In large-scale federated and decentralized learning, communication efficiency is one of the most challenging bottlenecks. While gossip communication -- where agents can exchange information with their connected neighbors -- is more cost-effective than communicating with the remote server, it often requires a greater number of communication rounds, especially for large and sparse networks. To tackle the trade-off, we examine the communication efficiency under a semi-decentralized communication protocol, in which agents can perform both agent-to-agent and agent-to-server communication in a probabilistic manner. We design a tailored communication-efficient algorithm over semi-decentralized networks, referred to as PISCO, which inherits the robustness to data heterogeneity thanks to gradient tracking and allows multiple local updates for saving communication. We establish the convergence rate of PISCO for nonconvex problems and show that PISCO enjoys a linear speedup in terms of the number of agents and local updates. Our numerical results highlight the superior communication efficiency of PISCO and its resilience to data heterogeneity and various network topologies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across diverse applications. However, concerns regarding their security, particularly the vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, persist. Drawing inspiration from adversarial training in deep learning and LLM agent learning processes, we introduce the In-Context Adversarial Game (ICAG) for defending against jailbreaks without the need for fine-tuning. ICAG leverages agent learning to conduct an adversarial game, aiming to dynamically extend knowledge to defend against jailbreaks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on static datasets, ICAG employs an iterative process to enhance both the defense and attack agents. This continuous improvement process strengthens defenses against newly generated jailbreak prompts. Our empirical studies affirm ICAG's efficacy, where LLMs safeguarded by ICAG exhibit significantly reduced jailbreak success rates across various attack scenarios. Moreover, ICAG demonstrates remarkable transferability to other LLMs, indicating its potential as a versatile defense mechanism.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet they fall short when tackling more sophisticated challenges, especially when interacting with environments through generating executable actions. This inadequacy primarily stems from the lack of built-in action knowledge in language agents, which fails to effectively guide the planning trajectories during task solving and results in planning hallucination. To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge. Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents. Experimental results on HotpotQA and ALFWorld based on various backbone models demonstrate that KnowAgent can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing baselines. Further analysis indicates the effectiveness of KnowAgent in terms of planning hallucinations mitigation. Code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowAgent.

Abstract: Can advanced multi-modal models effectively tackle complex web-based tasks? Such tasks are often found on crowdsourcing platforms, where crowdworkers engage in challenging micro-tasks within web-based environments.
  Building on this idea, we present TurkingBench, a benchmark consisting of tasks presented as web pages with textual instructions and multi-modal contexts. Unlike previous approaches that rely on artificially synthesized web pages, our benchmark uses natural HTML pages originally designed for crowdsourcing workers to perform various annotation tasks. Each task's HTML instructions are instantiated with different values derived from crowdsourcing tasks, creating diverse instances. This benchmark includes 32.2K instances spread across 158 tasks.
  To support the evaluation of TurkingBench, we have developed a framework that links chatbot responses to actions on web pages (e.g., modifying a text box, selecting a radio button). We assess the performance of cutting-edge private and open-source models, including language-only and vision-language models (such as GPT4 and InternVL), on this benchmark. Our results show that while these models outperform random chance, there is still significant room for improvement. We hope that this benchmark will drive progress in the evaluation and development of web-based agents.

Abstract: Fault Localization (FL) is an essential step during the debugging process. With the strong capabilities of code comprehension, the recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in diagnosing bugs in the code. Nevertheless, due to LLMs' limited performance in handling long contexts, existing LLM-based fault localization remains on localizing bugs within a small code scope (i.e., a method or a class), which struggles to diagnose bugs for a large code scope (i.e., an entire software system). To address the limitation, this paper presents AgentFL, a multi-agent system based on ChatGPT for automated fault localization. By simulating the behavior of a human developer, AgentFL models the FL task as a three-step process, which involves comprehension, navigation, and confirmation. Within each step, AgentFL hires agents with diversified expertise, each of which utilizes different tools to handle specific tasks. Particularly, we adopt a series of auxiliary strategies such as Test Behavior Tracking, Document-Guided Search, and Multi-Round Dialogue to overcome the challenges in each step. The evaluation on the widely used Defects4J-V1.2.0 benchmark shows that AgentFL can localize 157 out of 395 bugs within Top-1, which outperforms the other LLM-based approaches and exhibits complementarity to the state-of-the-art learning-based techniques. Additionally, we confirm the indispensability of the components in AgentFL with the ablation study and demonstrate the usability of AgentFL through a user study. Finally, the cost analysis shows that AgentFL spends an average of only 0.074 dollars and 97 seconds for a single bug.

<div> 关键词：冲突避免、分布式部署、圆形边界、凸层、搜索空间

总结:
本文提出了一种解决点状代理在覆盖所有代理的圆形周边上冲突避免分布的问题。该方法的关键要素包括使用代理人初始位置构建的一组凸层层（嵌套凸多边形）以及为每个代理人定义的一种新的搜索空间区域。代理人的搜索空间被定义为其位置与支持边垂直相交的线之间的区域。通过设计一种目标分配策略，能够在初始化时就为每个代理分配一个位于其搜索空间内的唯一目标位置，之后无需进一步计算。与现有文献相比，本文提出了一种仅利用代理人初始位置的、一次性、无碰撞的圆形分布解决方案。文中通过示例证明了所提策略的有效性。<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This article considers the problem of conflict-free distribution of point-sized agents on a circular periphery encompassing all agents. The two key elements of the proposed policy include the construction of a set of convex layers (nested convex polygons) using the initial positions of the agents, and a novel search space region for each of the agents. The search space for an agent on a convex layer is defined as the region enclosed between the lines passing through the agent's position and normal to its supporting edges. Guaranteeing collision-free paths, a goal assignment policy designates a unique goal position within the search space of an agent at the initial time itself, requiring no further computation thereafter. In contrast to the existing literature, this work presents a one-shot, collision-free solution to the circular distribution problem by utilizing only the initial positions of the agents. Illustrative examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policy.

<br /><br />总结:
本文介绍了近期在图像生成领域取得的进步，特别是在前景条件下的图像生成仍面临挑战，如对象完整性受损、前后景不一致、多样性有限和控制灵活性降低等问题。针对这些问题，文章提出了一种名为“Anywhere”的多代理框架，该框架摒弃了传统的端到端方法，每个代理专注于不同的任务，如前景理解、多样性增强、物体完整性保护和文本提示一致性等。此外，Anywhere框架还支持用户可选的文本输入、自动化质量评估以及根据需要进行重生成的功能。实验结果显示，这种模块化设计有效地克服了现有端到端模型的局限性，显著提高了前景条件下图像生成的保真度、质量和多样性，并增强了可控性。同时，Anywhere框架具有可扩展性，能够从各个单个代理未来的进步中获益。 <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in image-conditioned image generation have demonstrated substantial progress. However, foreground-conditioned image generation remains underexplored, encountering challenges such as compromised object integrity, foreground-background inconsistencies, limited diversity, and reduced control flexibility. These challenges arise from current end-to-end inpainting models, which suffer from inaccurate training masks, limited foreground semantic understanding, data distribution biases, and inherent interference between visual and textual prompts. To overcome these limitations, we present Anywhere, a multi-agent framework that departs from the traditional end-to-end approach. In this framework, each agent is specialized in a distinct aspect, such as foreground understanding, diversity enhancement, object integrity protection, and textual prompt consistency. Our framework is further enhanced with the ability to incorporate optional user textual inputs, perform automated quality assessments, and initiate re-generation as needed. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that this modular design effectively overcomes the limitations of existing end-to-end models, resulting in higher fidelity, quality, diversity and controllability in foreground-conditioned image generation. Additionally, the Anywhere framework is extensible, allowing it to benefit from future advancements in each individual agent.

Abstract: In many sequential decision problems, an agent performs a repeated task. He then suffers regret and obtains information that he may use in the following rounds. However, sometimes the agent may also obtain information and avoid suffering regret by querying external sources. We study the trade-off between the information an agent accumulates and the regret it suffers. We invoke information-theoretic methods for obtaining regret lower bounds, that also allow us to easily re-derive several known lower bounds. We introduce the first Bayesian regret lower bounds that depend on the information an agent accumulates. We also prove regret upper bounds using the amount of information the agent accumulates. These bounds show that information measured in bits, can be traded off for regret, measured in reward. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of these bounds in improving the performance of a question-answering task with large language models, allowing us to obtain valuable insights.

Abstract: The recent introduction of the Assistants API highlights its potential for large language models (LLMs) in role-playing agents (RPA). However, maintaining consistent character personas remains a significant challenge due to variability in information extraction, which frequently omits critical elements such as backstory or interpersonal relationships. To address this limitation, we introduce CharacterGPT, a framework designed to dynamically reconstruct character personas through Character Persona Training (CPT). This approach incrementally updates personas by extracting traits from chapter-wise novel summaries, reflecting the progression of the narrative. Our framework is evaluated through Big Five personality evaluations and creative tasks, in which characters generate original narratives, demonstrating the efficacy of CharacterGPT in preserving persona consistency.

总结:
这篇论文主要关注于如何将大型语言模型（LLMs）适应于代理任务，并提出了一种名为直接偏好优化（DPO）的技术，该技术能有效缓解强化学习（RL）中的累积误差问题。然而，当DPO应用于多轮对话任务时，由于无法取消分区函数而面临挑战。为了解决这一难题，文章提出了将策略约束替换为状态-动作占用度量约束，并在布拉德利-泰瑞模型中添加长度归一化，从而形成了适用于多轮代理任务的新损失函数——DMPO，并对其理论依据进行了阐述。通过在三个多轮代理任务数据集上的大量实验，验证了DMPO损失函数的有效性和优越性。相关代码已发布在https://github.com/swt-user/DMPO上。 <div>

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for agent tasks is critical in developing language agents. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a promising technique for this adaptation with the alleviation of compounding errors, offering a means to directly optimize Reinforcement Learning (RL) objectives. However, applying DPO to multi-turn tasks presents challenges due to the inability to cancel the partition function. Overcoming this obstacle involves making the partition function independent of the current state and addressing length disparities between preferred and dis-preferred trajectories. In this light, we replace the policy constraint with the state-action occupancy measure constraint in the RL objective and add length normalization to the Bradley-Terry model, yielding a novel loss function named DMPO for multi-turn agent tasks with theoretical explanations. Extensive experiments on three multi-turn agent task datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the DMPO loss. The code is available at https://github.com/swt-user/DMPO.

Abstract: Dialogue agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) show superior performance in various tasks. Despite the better user understanding and human-like responses, their lack of controllability remains a key challenge, often leading to unfocused conversations or task failure. To address this, we introduce Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to regulate dialogue flow. Specifically, we propose ChatSOP, a novel SOP-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning framework designed to enhance the controllability of LLM-driven dialogue agents. To enable this, we curate a dataset comprising SOP-annotated multi-scenario dialogues, generated using a semi-automated role-playing system with GPT-4o and validated through strict manual quality control. Additionally, we propose a novel method that integrates Chain of Thought reasoning with supervised fine-tuning for SOP prediction and utilizes SOP-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search for optimal action planning during dialogues. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, such as achieving a 27.95% improvement in action accuracy compared to baseline models based on GPT-3.5 and also showing notable gains for open-source models. Dataset and codes are publicly available.

arXiv:2407.06426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent debates have been introduced to improve the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by having multiple agents discuss solutions to a problem over several rounds of debate. However, models often generate incorrect yet confident-sounding responses, which can mislead others. This issue arises partly because agents do not consider how confident their peers are. To address this, we propose DebUnc, a debate framework that uses uncertainty metrics to assess agent confidence. Confidence is then conveyed through a modified attention mechanism that adjusts token weights, or through textual prompts. Evaluations across benchmarks show that attention-based methods are particularly effective and that performance continues to improve as uncertainty estimation becomes more reliable.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Dynamic Co-Optimization Compiler (DCOC), which employs an adaptive Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework to enhance the efficiency of mapping machine learning (ML) models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), onto diverse hardware platforms. DCOC incorporates three specialized actor-critic agents within MARL, each dedicated to different optimization facets: one for hardware and two for software. This cooperative strategy results in an integrated hardware/software co-optimization approach, improving the precision and speed of DNN deployments. By focusing on high-confidence configurations, DCOC effectively reduces the search space, achieving remarkable performance over existing methods. Our results demonstrate that DCOC enhances throughput by up to 37.95% while reducing optimization time by up to 42.2% across various DNN models, outperforming current state-of-the-art frameworks.

Abstract: We introduce Random Latent Exploration (RLE), a simple yet effective exploration strategy in reinforcement learning (RL). On average, RLE outperforms noise-based methods, which perturb the agent's actions, and bonus-based exploration, which rewards the agent for attempting novel behaviors. The core idea of RLE is to encourage the agent to explore different parts of the environment by pursuing randomly sampled goals in a latent space. RLE is as simple as noise-based methods, as it avoids complex bonus calculations but retains the deep exploration benefits of bonus-based methods. Our experiments show that RLE improves performance on average in both discrete (e.g., Atari) and continuous control tasks (e.g., Isaac Gym), enhancing exploration while remaining a simple and general plug-in for existing RL algorithms.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to identify causal relationships between variables and is a critical research area in machine learning. Traditional methods focus on statistical or machine learning algorithms to uncover causal links from structured data, often overlooking the valuable contextual information provided by metadata. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in creating unified causal discovery frameworks by incorporating both structured data and metadata. However, their potential in multi-agent settings remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-Agent Causal Discovery Framework (MAC), which consists of two key modules: the Debate-Coding Module (DCM) and the Meta-Debate Module (MDM). The DCM begins with a multi-agent debating and coding process, where agents use both structured data and metadata to collaboratively select the most suitable statistical causal discovery (SCD) method. The selected SCD is then applied to the structured data to generate an initial causal graph. This causal graph is transformed into causal metadata through the Meta Fusion mechanism. With all the metadata, MDM then refines the causal structure by leveraging a multi-agent debating framework. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that MAC outperforms both traditional statistical causal discovery methods and existing LLM-based approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is an appealing paradigm for training intelligent agents, enabling policy acquisition from the agent's own autonomously acquired experience. However, the training process of RL is far from automatic, requiring extensive human effort to reset the agent and environments. To tackle the challenging reset-free setting, we first demonstrate the superiority of model-based (MB) RL methods in such setting, showing that a straightforward adaptation of MBRL can outperform all the prior state-of-the-art methods while requiring less supervision. We then identify limitations inherent to this direct extension and propose a solution called model-based reset-free (MoReFree) agent, which further enhances the performance. MoReFree adapts two key mechanisms, exploration and policy learning, to handle reset-free tasks by prioritizing task-relevant states. It exhibits superior data-efficiency across various reset-free tasks without access to environmental reward or demonstrations while significantly outperforming privileged baselines that require supervision. Our findings suggest model-based methods hold significant promise for reducing human effort in RL. Website: https://yangzhao-666.github.io/morefree

Abstract: In this article, we present an end-to-end collision avoidance policy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for multi-agent systems, demonstrating encouraging outcomes in real-world applications. In particular, our policy calculates the control commands of the agent based on the raw LiDAR observation. In addition, the number of parameters of the proposed basic model is 140,000, and the size of the parameter file is 3.5 MB, which allows the robot to calculate the actions from the CPU alone. We propose a multi-agent training platform based on a physics-based simulator to further bridge the gap between simulation and the real world. The policy is trained on a policy-gradients-based RL algorithm in a dense and messy training environment. A novel reward function is introduced to address the issue of agents choosing suboptimal actions in some common scenarios. Although the data used for training is exclusively from the simulation platform, the policy can be successfully transferred and deployed in real-world robots. Finally, our policy effectively responds to intentional obstructions and avoids collisions. The website is available at https://sites.google.com/view/xingrong2024efficient/%E9%A6%96%E9%A1%B5.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive language/vision reasoning abilities, igniting the recent trend of building agents for targeted applications such as shopping assistants or AI software engineers. Recently, many data science benchmarks have been proposed to investigate their performance in the data science domain. However, existing data science benchmarks still fall short when compared to real-world data science applications due to their simplified settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce DSBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate data science agents with realistic tasks. This benchmark includes 466 data analysis tasks and 74 data modeling tasks, sourced from Eloquence and Kaggle competitions. DSBench offers a realistic setting by encompassing long contexts, multimodal task backgrounds, reasoning with large data files and multi-table structures, and performing end-to-end data modeling tasks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, LVLMs, and agents shows that they struggle with most tasks, with the best agent solving only 34.12% of data analysis tasks and achieving a 34.74% Relative Performance Gap (RPG). These findings underscore the need for further advancements in developing more practical, intelligent, and autonomous data science agents.

本文提出了一种名为CORY的新方法，用于改进大型语言模型的强化学习微调。现有的RL微调主要依赖于PPO及其变体，但在LLM微调中可能会表现不佳并易发生分布塌陷。CORY将LLM的RL微调扩展到一个多智能体协同强化学习框架，利用多智能体系统的协同演化和自涌现能力。通过将待微调的LLM复制为两个自主代理——先锋和观察者，这两个代理根据查询生成响应并相互合作与演化。实验结果显示，相比于PPO，CORY在IMDB Review和GSM8K数据集上基于主观和客观奖励函数对GPT-2和Llama-2进行微调时，表现出更好的策略优化性、抗分布塌陷能力和训练稳定性，从而证明了其作为现实世界应用中LLM微调优越方法论的潜力。 <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on specific tasks. However, prevailing RL fine-tuning methods predominantly rely on PPO and its variants. Though these algorithms are effective in general RL settings, they often exhibit suboptimal performance and vulnerability to distribution collapse when applied to the fine-tuning of LLMs. In this paper, we propose CORY, extending the RL fine-tuning of LLMs to a sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, to leverage the inherent coevolution and emergent capabilities of multi-agent systems. In CORY, the LLM to be fine-tuned is initially duplicated into two autonomous agents: a pioneer and an observer. The pioneer generates responses based on queries, while the observer generates responses using both the queries and the pioneer's responses. The two agents are trained together. During training, the agents exchange roles periodically, fostering cooperation and coevolution between them. Experiments evaluate CORY's performance by fine-tuning GPT-2 and Llama-2 under subjective and objective reward functions on the IMDB Review and GSM8K datasets, respectively. Results show that CORY outperforms PPO in terms of policy optimality, resistance to distribution collapse, and training robustness, thereby underscoring its potential as a superior methodology for refining LLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional ability to handle a wide range of tasks, have driven significant advancements in tackling reasoning and planning tasks, wherein decomposing complex problems into executable workflows is a crucial step in this process. Existing workflow evaluation frameworks either focus solely on holistic performance or suffer from limitations such as restricted scenario coverage, simplistic workflow structures, and lax evaluation standards. To this end, we introduce WorfBench, a unified workflow generation benchmark with multi-faceted scenarios and intricate graph workflow structures. Additionally, we present WorfEval, a systemic evaluation protocol utilizing subsequence and subgraph matching algorithms to accurately quantify the LLM agent's workflow generation capabilities. Through comprehensive evaluations across different types of LLMs, we discover distinct gaps between the sequence planning capabilities and graph planning capabilities of LLM agents, with even GPT-4 exhibiting a gap of around 15%. We also train two open-source models and evaluate their generalization abilities on held-out tasks. Furthermore, we observe that the generated workflows can enhance downstream tasks, enabling them to achieve superior performance with less time during inference.

<div> 关键词: 信息检索、下一代范式、智能代理、大型语言模型、动态信息状态

总结:
本文提出了一个新的信息检索概念——智能代理信息检索(Agentic IR)，这是一种由大型语言模型和AI代理驱动的下一代信息检索范式。与传统的依赖静态、预定义信息项的信息检索不同，Agentic IR将“信息”重新定义为动态、上下文相关的信息状态，即用户在动态环境中所处的具体信息情境，包括实时用户偏好、上下文因素及决策过程。它扩展了传统信息检索的任务，从基于查询获取相关信息项转变为根据用户指令实现目标信息状态。文章系统性地讨论了Agentic IR在任务定义、架构、评估、案例研究以及挑战与未来前景等方面的各个方面。本文认为，Agentic IR这一概念的提出不仅拓宽了信息检索研究的范围，也为构建更加适应、互动和智能的下一代信息检索奠定了基础。 <div>

Abstract: Since the 1970s, information retrieval (IR) has long been defined as the process of acquiring relevant information items from a pre-defined corpus to satisfy user information needs. Traditional IR systems, while effective in domains like web search, are constrained by their reliance on static, pre-defined information items. To this end, this paper introduces agentic information retrieval (Agentic IR), a transformative next-generation paradigm for IR driven by large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. The central shift in agentic IR is the evolving definition of ``information'' from static, pre-defined information items to dynamic, context-dependent information states. Information state refers to a particular information context that the user is right in within a dynamic environment, encompassing not only the acquired information items but also real-time user preferences, contextual factors, and decision-making processes. In such a way, traditional information retrieval, focused on acquiring relevant information items based on user queries, can be naturally extended to achieving the target information state given the user instruction, which thereby defines the agentic information retrieval. We systematically discuss agentic IR from various aspects, i.e., task formulation, architecture, evaluation, case studies, as well as challenges and future prospects. We believe that the concept of agentic IR introduced in this paper not only broadens the scope of information retrieval research but also lays the foundation for a more adaptive, interactive, and intelligent next-generation IR paradigm.

Abstract: Smartphone agents are increasingly important for helping users control devices efficiently, with (Multimodal) Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approaches emerging as key contenders. Fairly comparing these agents is essential but challenging, requiring a varied task scope, the integration of agents with different implementations, and a generalisable evaluation pipeline to assess their strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we present SPA-B ENCH, a comprehensive SmartPhone Agent Benchmark designed to evaluate (M)LLM-based agents in an interactive environment that simulates real-world conditions. SPA-B ENCH offers three key contributions: (1) A diverse set of tasks covering system and third-party apps in both English and Chinese, focusing on features commonly used in daily routines; (2) A plug-and-play framework enabling real-time agent interaction with Android devices, integrating over ten agents with the flexibility to add more; (3) A novel evaluation pipeline that automatically assesses agent performance across multiple dimensions, encompassing seven metrics related to task completion and resource consumption. Our extensive experiments across tasks and agents reveal challenges like interpreting mobile user interfaces, action grounding, memory retention, and execution costs. We propose future research directions to ease these difficulties, moving closer to real-world smartphone agent applications. SPA-B ENCH is available at https://ai-agents-2030.github.io/SPA-Bench/.

Abstract: Graphs are widely used for modeling relational data in real-world scenarios, such as social networks and urban computing. Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy.

Abstract: We explore solutions for fairly allocating indivisible items among agents assigned weights representing their entitlements. Our fairness goal is weighted-envy-freeness (WEF), where each agent deems their allocated portion relative to their entitlement at least as favorable as any other's relative to their own. In many cases, achieving WEF necessitates monetary transfers, which can be modeled as third-party subsidies. The goal is to attain WEF with bounded subsidies.
  Previous work in the unweighted setting of subsidies relied on basic characterizations of EF that fail in the weighted settings. This makes our new setting challenging and theoretically intriguing. We present polynomial-time algorithms that compute WEF-able allocations with an upper bound on the subsidy per agent in three distinct additive valuation scenarios: (1) general, (2) identical, and (3) binary. When all weights are equal, our bounds reduce to the bounds derived in the literature for the unweighted setting.

Abstract: We consider $n$ unit-speed mobile agents initially positioned at the center of a unit disk, tasked with inspecting all points on the disk's perimeter. A perimeter point is considered covered if an agent positioned outside the disk's interior has unobstructed visibility of it, treating the disk itself as an obstacle. For $n=1$, this problem is referred to as the shoreline problem with a known distance. Isbell in 1957 derived an optimal trajectory that minimizes the worst-case inspection time for that problem. The one-agent version of the problem was originally proposed as a more tractable variant of Bellman's famous lost-in-the-forest problem.
  Our contributions are threefold. First, and as a warm-up, we extend Isbell's findings by deriving worst-case optimal trajectories addressing the partial inspection of a section of the disk, hence deriving an alternative proof of optimality for inspecting the disk with $n \geq 2$ agents. Second, we analyze the average-case inspection time, assuming a uniform distribution of perimeter points (equivalent to randomized inspection algorithms). Using spatial discretization and Nonlinear Programming (NLP), we propose feasible solutions to the continuous problem and evaluate their effectiveness compared to NLP solutions. Third, we establish Pareto-optimal bounds for the multi-objective problem of jointly minimizing the worst-case and average-case inspection times.

Abstract: This paper studies the performative policy learning problem, where agents adjust their features in response to a released policy to improve their potential outcomes, inducing an endogenous distribution shift. There has been growing interest in training machine learning models in strategic environments, including strategic classification and performative prediction. However, existing approaches often rely on restrictive parametric assumptions: micro-level utility models in strategic classification and macro-level data distribution maps in performative prediction, severely limiting scalability and generalizability. We approach this problem as a complex causal inference task, relaxing parametric assumptions on both micro-level agent behavior and macro-level data distribution. Leveraging bounded rationality, we uncover a practical low-dimensional structure in distribution shifts and construct an effective mediator in the causal path from the deployed model to the shifted data. We then propose a gradient-based policy optimization algorithm with a differentiable classifier as a substitute for the high-dimensional distribution map. Our algorithm efficiently utilizes batch feedback and limited manipulation patterns. Our approach achieves high sample efficiency compared to methods reliant on bandit feedback or zero-order optimization. We also provide theoretical guarantees for algorithmic convergence. Extensive and challenging experiments on high-dimensional settings demonstrate our method's practical efficacy.

Abstract: In India, the majority of farmers are classified as small or marginal, making their livelihoods particularly vulnerable to economic losses due to market saturation and climate risks. Effective crop planning can significantly impact their expected income, yet existing decision support systems (DSS) often provide generic recommendations that fail to account for real-time market dynamics and the interactions among multiple farmers. In this paper, we evaluate the viability of three multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches for optimizing total farmer income and promoting fairness in crop planning: Independent Q-Learning (IQL), where each farmer acts independently without coordination, Agent-by-Agent (ABA), which sequentially optimizes each farmer's policy in relation to the others, and the Multi-agent Rollout Policy, which jointly optimizes all farmers' actions for global reward maximization. Our results demonstrate that while IQL offers computational efficiency with linear runtime, it struggles with coordination among agents, leading to lower total rewards and an unequal distribution of income. Conversely, the Multi-agent Rollout policy achieves the highest total rewards and promotes equitable income distribution among farmers but requires significantly more computational resources, making it less practical for large numbers of agents. ABA strikes a balance between runtime efficiency and reward optimization, offering reasonable total rewards with acceptable fairness and scalability. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate MARL approaches in DSS to provide personalized and equitable crop planning recommendations, advancing the development of more adaptive and farmer-centric agricultural decision-making systems.

Abstract: Building generalist agents that can rapidly adapt to new environments is a key challenge for deploying AI in the digital and real worlds. Is scaling current agent architectures the most effective way to build generalist agents? We propose a novel approach to pre-train relatively small policies on relatively small datasets and adapt them to unseen environments via in-context learning, without any finetuning. Our key idea is that retrieval offers a powerful bias for fast adaptation. Indeed, we demonstrate that even a simple retrieval-based 1-nearest neighbor agent offers a surprisingly strong baseline for today's state-of-the-art generalist agents. From this starting point, we construct a semi-parametric agent, REGENT, that trains a transformer-based policy on sequences of queries and retrieved neighbors. REGENT can generalize to unseen robotics and game-playing environments via retrieval augmentation and in-context learning, achieving this with up to 3x fewer parameters and up to an order-of-magnitude fewer pre-training datapoints, significantly outperforming today's state-of-the-art generalist agents.

A two-level DA architecture is proposed to assist the QoE-driven network slicing and orchestration. Three potential solutions are presented from the perspectives of DA data collection, resource scheduling, and DA deployment. A case study demonstrates that the proposed framework can effectively improve user QoE compared with benchmark schemes.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based agents have proved their ability to perform complex tasks like humans. However, there is still a large gap between open-sourced LLMs and commercial models like the GPT series. In this paper, we focus on improving the agent generalization capabilities of LLMs via instruction tuning. We first observe that the existing agent training corpus exhibits satisfactory results on held-in evaluation sets but fails to generalize to held-out sets. These agent-tuning works face severe formatting errors and are frequently stuck in the same mistake for a long while. We analyze that the poor generalization ability comes from overfitting to several manual agent environments and a lack of adaptation to new situations. They struggle with the wrong action steps and can not learn from the experience but just memorize existing observation-action relations. Inspired by the insight, we propose a novel AgentRefine framework for agent-tuning. The core idea is to enable the model to learn to correct its mistakes via observation in the trajectory. Specifically, we propose an agent synthesis framework to encompass a diverse array of environments and tasks and prompt a strong LLM to refine its error action according to the environment feedback. AgentRefine significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent-tuning work in terms of generalization ability on diverse agent tasks. It also has better robustness facing perturbation and can generate diversified thought in inference. Our findings establish the correlation between agent generalization and self-refinement and provide a new paradigm for future research.

Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great success in automated planning and task execution. However, the effective adjustment of agentic workflows during execution has not been well studied. An effective workflow adjustment is crucial in real-world scenarios, as the initial plan must adjust to unforeseen challenges and changing conditions in real time to ensure the efficient execution of complex tasks. In this paper, we define workflows as an activity-on-vertex (AOV) graph, which allows continuous workflow refinement by LLM agents through dynamic subtask allocation adjustment based on historical performance and previous AOVs. To further enhance framework performance, we emphasize modularity in workflow design based on evaluating parallelism and dependency complexity. With this design, our proposed multi-agent framework achieves efficient concurrent execution of subtasks, effective goal achievement, and enhanced error tolerance. Empirical results across various practical tasks demonstrate significant improvements in the efficiency of multi-agent frameworks through dynamic workflow refinement and modularization.

Abstract: Interactive agents capable of understanding and executing instructions in the physical world have long been a central goal in AI research. The Minecraft Collaborative Building Task (MCBT) provides one such setting to work towards this goal (Narayan-Chen, Jayannavar, and Hockenmaier 2019). It is a two-player game in which an Architect (A) instructs a Builder (B) to construct a target structure in a simulated Blocks World Environment. We focus on the challenging Builder Action Prediction (BAP) subtask of predicting correct action sequences in a given multimodal game context with limited training data (Jayannavar, Narayan-Chen, and Hockenmaier 2020). We take a closer look at evaluation and data for the BAP task, discovering key challenges and making significant improvements on both fronts to propose BAP v2, an upgraded version of the task. This will allow future work to make more efficient and meaningful progress on it. It comprises of: (1) an enhanced evaluation benchmark that includes a cleaner test set and fairer, more insightful metrics, and (2) additional synthetic training data generated from novel Minecraft dialogue and target structure simulators emulating the MCBT. We show that the synthetic data can be used to train more performant and robust neural models even with relatively simple training methods. Looking ahead, such data could also be crucial for training more sophisticated, data-hungry deep transformer models and training/fine-tuning increasingly large LLMs. Although modeling is not the primary focus of this work, we also illustrate the impact of our data and training methodologies on a simple LLM- and transformer-based model, thus validating the robustness of our approach, and setting the stage for more advanced architectures and LLMs going forward.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach for controlling a team of agile fixed-wing aerial vehicles in close proximity to one another. Our approach relies on receding-horizon nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to plan maneuvers across an expanded flight envelope to enable inter-agent collision avoidance. To facilitate robust collision avoidance and characterize the likelihood of inter-agent collisions, we compute a statistical bound on the probability of the system leaving a tube around the planned nominal trajectory. Finally, we propose a metric for evaluating highly dynamic swarms and use this metric to evaluate our approach. We successfully demonstrated our approach through both simulation and hardware experiments, and to our knowledge, this the first time close-quarters swarming has been achieved with physical aerobatic fixed-wing vehicles.

Through a randomized controlled trial with 233 participants, we examined human susceptibility to such manipulation in financial (e.g., purchases) and emotional (e.g., conflict resolution) decision-making contexts. Participants interacted with one of three AI agents: a neutral agent (NA) optimizing for user benefit without explicit influence, a manipulative agent (MA) designed to covertly influence beliefs and behaviors, or a strategy-enhanced manipulative agent (SEMA) employing explicit psychological tactics to reach its hidden objectives. By analyzing participants' decision patterns and shifts in their preference ratings post-interaction, we found significant susceptibility to AI-driven manipulation. Particularly, across both decision-making domains, participants interacting with the manipulative agents shifted toward harmful options at substantially higher rates (financial, MA: 62.3%, SEMA: 59.6%; emotional, MA: 42.3%, SEMA: 41.5%) compared to the NA group (financial, 35.8%; emotional, 12.8%). Notably, our findings reveal that even subtle manipulative objectives (MA) can be as effective as employing explicit psychological strategies (SEMA) in swaying human decision-making. By revealing the potential for covert AI influence, this study highlights a critical vulnerability in human-AI interactions, emphasizing the need for ethical safeguards and regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible deployment of AI technologies and protect human autonomy.

<title>Salience-Invariant Consistent Policy Learning for Generalization in Visual Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Generalizing policies to unseen scenarios remains a critical challenge in visual reinforcement learning, where agents often overfit to the specific visual observations of the training environment. In unseen environments, distracting pixels may lead agents to extract representations containing task-irrelevant information. As a result, agents may deviate from the optimal behaviors learned during training, thereby hindering visual generalization.To address this issue, we propose the Salience-Invariant Consistent Policy Learning (SCPL) algorithm, an efficient framework for zero-shot generalization. Our approach introduces a novel value consistency module alongside a dynamics module to effectively capture task-relevant representations. The value consistency module, guided by saliency, ensures the agent focuses on task-relevant pixels in both original and perturbed observations, while the dynamics module uses augmented data to help the encoder capture dynamic- and reward-relevant representations. Additionally, our theoretical analysis highlights the importance of policy consistency for generalization. To strengthen this, we introduce a policy consistency module with a KL divergence constraint to maintain consistent policies across original and perturbed observations.Extensive experiments on the DMC-GB, Robotic Manipulation, and CARLA benchmarks demonstrate that SCPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalization. Notably, SCPL achieves average performance improvements of 14\%, 39\%, and 69\% in the challenging DMC video hard setting, the Robotic hard setting, and the CARLA benchmark, respectively.Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/scpl-rl.

Abstract: We explore solutions for fairly allocating indivisible items among agents assigned weights representing their entitlements. Our fairness goal is weighted-envy-freeness (WEF), where each agent deems their allocated portion relative to their entitlement at least as favorable as any others relative to their own. Often, achieving WEF necessitates monetary transfers, which can be modeled as third-party subsidies. The goal is to attain WEF with bounded subsidies.
  Previous work relied on characterizations of unweighted envy-freeness (EF), that fail in the weighted setting. This makes our new setting challenging. We present polynomial-time algorithms that compute WEF allocations with a guaranteed upper bound on total subsidy for monotone valuations and various subclasses thereof.
  We also present an efficient algorithm to compute a fair allocation of items and money, when the budget is not enough to make the allocation WEF. This algorithm is new even for the unweighted setting.

Abstract: Leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to create embodied agents offers a promising avenue for tackling real-world tasks. While language-centric embodied agents have garnered substantial attention, MLLM-based embodied agents remain underexplored due to the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmbodiedBench, an extensive benchmark designed to evaluate vision-driven embodied agents. EmbodiedBench features: (1) a diverse set of 1,128 testing tasks across four environments, ranging from high-level semantic tasks (e.g., household) to low-level tasks involving atomic actions (e.g., navigation and manipulation); and (2) six meticulously curated subsets evaluating essential agent capabilities like commonsense reasoning, complex instruction understanding, spatial awareness, visual perception, and long-term planning. Through extensive experiments, we evaluated 19 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs within EmbodiedBench. Our findings reveal that: MLLMs excel at high-level tasks but struggle with low-level manipulation, with the best model, GPT-4o, scoring only 28.9% on average. EmbodiedBench provides a multifaceted standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance MLLM-based embodied agents.

Abstract: Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously. Code of DPT-Agent can be found in https://github.com/sjtu-marl/DPT-Agent.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is now widely adopted as the final stage of large language model training, especially for reasoning-style tasks such as maths problems. Typically, models attempt each question many times during a single training step and attempt to learn from their successes and failures. However, we demonstrate that throughout training with two popular algorithms (PPO and VinePPO) on two widely used datasets, many questions are either solved by all attempts - meaning they are already learned - or by none - providing no meaningful training signal. To address this, we adapt a method from the reinforcement learning literature - sampling for learnability - and apply it to the reinforcement learning stage of LLM training. Our curriculum prioritises questions with high variance of success, i.e. those where the agent sometimes succeeds, but not always. Our findings demonstrate that this curriculum consistently boosts training performance across multiple algorithms and datasets, paving the way for more efficient and effective reinforcement learning with LLMs.

Abstract: An increasingly prevalent socio-technical problem is people being taken in by offers that sound ``too good to be true'', where persuasion and trust shape decision-making. This paper investigates how \abr{ai} can help detect these deceptive scenarios. We analyze how humans strategically deceive each other in \textit{Diplomacy}, a board game that requires both natural language communication and strategic reasoning. This requires extracting logical forms of proposed agreements in player communications and computing the relative rewards of the proposal using agents' value functions. Combined with text-based features, this can improve our deception detection. Our method detects human deception with a high precision when compared to a Large Language Model approach that flags many true messages as deceptive. Future human-\abr{ai} interaction tools can build on our methods for deception detection by triggering \textit{friction} to give users a chance of interrogating suspicious proposals.

Abstract: Conversational repair is a mechanism used to detect and resolve miscommunication and misinformation problems when two or more agents interact. One particular and underexplored form of repair in emergent communication is the implicit repair mechanism, where the interlocutor purposely conveys the desired information in such a way as to prevent misinformation from any other interlocutor. This work explores how redundancy can modify the emergent communication protocol to continue conveying the necessary information to complete the underlying task, even with additional external environmental pressures such as noise. We focus on extending the signaling game, called the Lewis Game, by adding noise in the communication channel and inputs received by the agents. Our analysis shows that agents add redundancy to the transmitted messages as an outcome to prevent the negative impact of noise on the task success. Additionally, we observe that the emerging communication protocol's generalization capabilities remain equivalent to architectures employed in simpler games that are entirely deterministic. Additionally, our method is the only one suitable for producing robust communication protocols that can handle cases with and without noise while maintaining increased generalization performance levels.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate symbolic world models from textual descriptions. Although LLMs have been extensively explored in the context of world modeling, prior studies encountered several challenges, including evaluation randomness, dependence on indirect metrics, and a limited domain scope. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel benchmark, Text2World, based on planning domain definition language (PDDL), featuring hundreds of diverse domains and employing multi-criteria, execution-based metrics for a more robust evaluation. We benchmark current LLMs using Text2World and find that reasoning models trained with large-scale reinforcement learning outperform others. However, even the best-performing model still demonstrates limited capabilities in world modeling. Building on these insights, we examine several promising strategies to enhance the world modeling capabilities of LLMs, including test-time scaling, agent training, and more. We hope that Text2World can serve as a crucial resource, laying the groundwork for future research in leveraging LLMs as world models.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are valuable tools for representing relationships between entities in a structured format. Traditionally, these knowledge bases are queried to extract specific information. However, question-answering (QA) over such KGs poses a challenge due to the intrinsic complexity of natural language compared to the structured format and the size of these graphs. Despite these challenges, the structured nature of KGs can provide a solid foundation for grounding the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering organizations increased reliability and control.
  Recent advancements in LLMs have introduced reasoning methods at inference time to improve their performance and maximize their capabilities. In this work, we propose integrating these reasoning strategies with KGs to anchor every step or "thought" of the reasoning chains in KG data. Specifically, we evaluate both agentic and automated search methods across several reasoning strategies, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and Graph-of-Thought (GoT), using GRBench, a benchmark dataset for graph reasoning with domain-specific graphs. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach consistently outperforms baseline models, highlighting the benefits of grounding LLM reasoning processes in structured KG data.

Abstract: Natural language interaction with agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI), driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), is expected to remain a dominant paradigm in the near future. While humans instinctively align their communication with mental states -- an ability known as Theory of Mind (ToM), current LLM powered systems exhibit significant limitations in this regard. This study examines the extent to which open source language models (LLaMA) can capture and preserve ToM related information and how effectively it contributes to consistent ToM reasoning in generated responses. We further investigate whether explicit manipulation of ToM related components, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, can enhance response alignment. Experiments on two LLaMA 3 variants demonstrate that incorporating ToM informed alignment improves response quality, achieving win rates of 67 and 63 percent for the 3B and 8B models, respectively. These findings highlight the potential of ToM driven strategies to improve alignment in LLM based conversational agents.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction allows better decision-making in applications of autonomous vehicles or surveillance by predicting the short-term future movement of traffic agents. It is classified into pedestrian or heterogeneous trajectory prediction. The former exploits the relatively consistent behavior of pedestrians, but is limited in real-world scenarios with heterogeneous traffic agents such as cyclists and vehicles. The latter typically relies on extra class label information to distinguish the heterogeneous agents, but such labels are costly to annotate and cannot be generalized to represent different behaviors within the same class of agents. In this work, we introduce the behavioral pseudo-labels that effectively capture the behavior distributions of pedestrians and heterogeneous agents solely based on their motion features, significantly improving the accuracy of trajectory prediction. To implement the framework, we propose the Behavioral Pseudo-Label Informed Sparse Graph Convolution Network (BP-SGCN) that learns pseudo-labels and informs to a trajectory predictor. For optimization, we propose a cascaded training scheme, in which we first learn the pseudo-labels in an unsupervised manner, and then perform end-to-end fine-tuning on the labels in the direction of increasing the trajectory prediction accuracy. Experiments show that our pseudo-labels effectively model different behavior clusters and improve trajectory prediction. Our proposed BP-SGCN outperforms existing methods using both pedestrian (ETH/UCY, pedestrian-only SDD) and heterogeneous agent datasets (SDD, Argoverse 1).

Abstract: This paper addresses information design in a workhorse model of network games, where agents have linear best responses, the information designer optimizes a quadratic objective, and the payoff state follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We formulate the problem as semidefinite programming (SDP) and utilize the duality principle to characterize an optimal information structure. A Gaussian information structure is shown to be optimal among all information structures. A necessary and sufficient condition for optimality is that the induced equilibrium strategy profile and the state jointly satisfy a linear constraint derived from complementary slackness conditions. Consequently, the true state is typically revealed to the entire population of agents, even though individual agents remain only partially informed. In symmetric network games, an optimal information structure inherits the same degree of symmetry, which facilitates its computation.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using societies of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance, efforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or multi-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, multi-agent systems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative dynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading framework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in specialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical analysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull and Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team monitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and historical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic, collaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading performance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its superiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading. TradingAgents is available at https://github.com/TradingAgents-AI.

Abstract: The development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is likely to be one of humanity's most consequential technological advancements. Leading AI labs and scientists have called for the global prioritization of AI safety citing existential risks comparable to nuclear war. However, research on catastrophic risks and AI alignment is often met with skepticism, even by experts. Furthermore, online debate over the existential risk of AI has begun to turn tribal (e.g. name-calling such as "doomer" or "accelerationist"). Until now, no systematic study has explored the patterns of belief and the levels of familiarity with AI safety concepts among experts. I surveyed 111 AI experts on their familiarity with AI safety concepts, key objections to AI safety, and reactions to safety arguments. My findings reveal that AI experts cluster into two viewpoints -- an "AI as controllable tool" and an "AI as uncontrollable agent" perspective -- diverging in beliefs toward the importance of AI safety. While most experts (78%) agreed or strongly agreed that "technical AI researchers should be concerned about catastrophic risks", many were unfamiliar with specific AI safety concepts. For example, only 21% of surveyed experts had heard of "instrumental convergence," a fundamental concept in AI safety predicting that advanced AI systems will tend to pursue common sub-goals (such as self-preservation). The least concerned participants were the least familiar with concepts like this, suggesting that effective communication of AI safety should begin with establishing clear conceptual foundations in the field.

Abstract: Collaborative 3D object detection holds significant importance in the field of autonomous driving, as it greatly enhances the perception capabilities of each individual agent by facilitating information exchange among multiple agents. However, in practice, due to pose estimation errors and time delays, the fusion of information across agents often results in feature representations with spatial and temporal noise, leading to detection errors. Diffusion models naturally have the ability to denoise noisy samples to the ideal data, which motivates us to explore the use of diffusion models to address the noise problem between multi-agent systems. In this work, we propose CoDiff, a novel robust collaborative perception framework that leverages the potential of diffusion models to generate more comprehensive and clearer feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply diffusion models to multi-agent collaborative perception. Specifically, we project high-dimensional feature map into the latent space of a powerful pre-trained autoencoder. Within this space, individual agent information serves as a condition to guide the diffusion model's sampling. This process denoises coarse feature maps and progressively refines the fused features. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework CoDiff consistently outperforms existing relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection performance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose and delay information of agents is with high-level noise.

Abstract: Predicting when to initiate speech in real-world environments remains a fundamental challenge for conversational agents. We introduce EgoSpeak, a novel framework for real-time speech initiation prediction in egocentric streaming video. By modeling the conversation from the speaker's first-person viewpoint, EgoSpeak is tailored for human-like interactions in which a conversational agent must continuously observe its environment and dynamically decide when to talk. Our approach bridges the gap between simplified experimental setups and complex natural conversations by integrating four key capabilities: (1) first-person perspective, (2) RGB processing, (3) online processing, and (4) untrimmed video processing. We also present YT-Conversation, a diverse collection of in-the-wild conversational videos from YouTube, as a resource for large-scale pretraining. Experiments on EasyCom and Ego4D demonstrate that EgoSpeak outperforms random and silence-based baselines in real time. Our results also highlight the importance of multimodal input and context length in effectively deciding when to speak.

Abstract: Although multi-agent collaborative Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant breakthroughs in the Text-to-SQL task, their performance is still constrained by various factors. These factors include the incompleteness of the framework, failure to follow instructions, and model hallucination problems. To address these problems, we propose OpenSearch-SQL, which divides the Text-to-SQL task into four main modules: Preprocessing, Extraction, Generation, and Refinement, along with an Alignment module based on a consistency alignment mechanism. This architecture aligns the inputs and outputs of agents through the Alignment module, reducing failures in instruction following and hallucination. Additionally, we designed an intermediate language called SQL-Like and optimized the structured CoT based on SQL-Like. Meanwhile, we developed a dynamic few-shot strategy in the form of self-taught Query-CoT-SQL. These methods have significantly improved the performance of LLMs in the Text-to-SQL task.
  In terms of model selection, we directly applied the base LLMs without any post-training, thereby simplifying the task chain and enhancing the framework's portability. Experimental results show that OpenSearch-SQL achieves an execution accuracy(EX) of 69.3% on the BIRD development set, 72.28% on the test set, and a reward-based validity efficiency score (R-VES) of 69.36%, with all three metrics ranking first at the time of submission. These results demonstrate the comprehensive advantages of the proposed method in both effectiveness and efficiency.

总结:
本文提出了一种名为Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)的智能代理，该代理利用自然语言查询将研究主题映射到精确、机器可解释的语义实体。RAG与苏格拉底式对话相结合，使得用户对研究话题的直观理解能与已建立的知识组织系统(KOSs)保持一致，从而有效地连接了“小语义”（领域特定的KOS结构）与“大语义”（广泛的引文计量库），使复杂的学术分类体系更易访问。文中通过一个名为CollabNext的应用示例进行了说明，这是一个以人为中心的知识图谱，连接人、组织和研究主题，特别关注 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) 和新兴研究人员，旨在提高历史上在现行科学体系中被边缘化的人群的可见性。 <div>
arXiv:2502.15005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agent that maps natural language queries about research topics to precise, machine-interpretable semantic entities. Our approach combines RAG with Socratic dialogue to align a user's intuitive understanding of research topics with established Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs). The proposed approach will effectively bridge "little semantics" (domain-specific KOS structures) with "big semantics" (broad bibliometric repositories), making complex academic taxonomies more accessible. Such agents have the potential for broad use. We illustrate with a sample application called CollabNext, which is a person-centric knowledge graph connecting people, organizations, and research topics. We further describe how the application design has an intentional focus on HBCUs and emerging researchers to raise visibility of people historically rendered invisible in the current science system.

Abstract: Problems of consensus in multi-agent systems are often viewed as a series of independent, simultaneous local decisions made between a limited set of options, all aimed at reaching a global agreement. Key challenges in these protocols include estimating the likelihood of various outcomes and finding bounds for how long it may take to achieve consensus, if it occurs at all.
  To date, little attention has been given to the case where some agents have no initial opinion. In this paper, we introduce a variant of the consensus problem which includes what we call `agnostic' nodes and frame it as a combination of two known and well-studied processes: voter model and rumour spreading. We show (1) a martingale that describes the probability of consensus for a given colour, (2) bounds on the number of steps for the process to end using results from rumour spreading and voter models, (3) closed formulas for the probability of consensus in a few special cases, and (4) that the computational complexity of estimating the probability with a Markov chain Monte Carlo process is $O(n^2 \log n)$ for general graphs and $O(n\log n)$ for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, which makes it an efficient method for estimating probabilities of consensus. Furthermore, we present experimental results suggesting that the number of runs needed for a given standard error decreases when the number of nodes increases.

<br /><br />总结:
随着大型语言模型（LLM）的应用日益广泛，其安全性漏洞问题愈发凸显。现有的安全基准测试主要依据通用标准来定义安全性，而忽视了用户特定的安全需求。文章指出，LLM的安全标准应根据用户的特定需求而非普适一致。为填补这一研究空白，作者提出了U-SAFEBENCH，这是首个用于评估LLM用户特定安全性方面的基准。对18款常用LLM进行的评价显示，当前的LLM在考虑用户特定安全标准时无法确保安全。针对此问题，作者提出了一种基于链式思考的简单改进方案，并证实其能有效提升用户特定的安全性。相关benchmark和代码已在https://github.com/yeonjun-in/U-SafeBench上公开。 <div>

Abstract: As the use of large language model (LLM) agents continues to grow, their safety vulnerabilities have become increasingly evident. Extensive benchmarks evaluate various aspects of LLM safety by defining the safety relying heavily on general standards, overlooking user-specific standards. However, safety standards for LLM may vary based on a user-specific profiles rather than being universally consistent across all users. This raises a critical research question: Do LLM agents act safely when considering user-specific safety standards? Despite its importance for safe LLM use, no benchmark datasets currently exist to evaluate the user-specific safety of LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce U-SAFEBENCH, the first benchmark designed to assess user-specific aspect of LLM safety. Our evaluation of 18 widely used LLMs reveals current LLMs fail to act safely when considering user-specific safety standards, marking a new discovery in this field. To address this vulnerability, we propose a simple remedy based on chain-of-thought, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving user-specific safety.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving systems remains a critical challenge, particularly in handling rare but potentially catastrophic safety-critical scenarios. While existing research has explored generating safety-critical scenarios for autonomous vehicle (AV) testing, there is limited work on effectively incorporating these scenarios into policy learning to enhance safety. Furthermore, developing training curricula that adapt to an AV's evolving behavioral patterns and performance bottlenecks remains largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we propose CurricuVLM, a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable personalized curriculum learning for autonomous driving agents. Our approach uniquely exploits VLMs' multimodal understanding capabilities to analyze agent behavior, identify performance weaknesses, and dynamically generate tailored training scenarios for curriculum adaptation. Through comprehensive analysis of unsafe driving situations with narrative descriptions, CurricuVLM performs in-depth reasoning to evaluate the AV's capabilities and identify critical behavioral patterns. The framework then synthesizes customized training scenarios targeting these identified limitations, enabling effective and personalized curriculum learning. Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset show that CurricuVLM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across both regular and safety-critical scenarios, achieving superior performance in terms of navigation success, driving efficiency, and safety metrics. Further analysis reveals that CurricuVLM serves as a general approach that can be integrated with various RL algorithms to enhance autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have upgraded them from sophisticated text generators to autonomous agents capable of corporation and tool use in multi-agent systems (MASs). However, the robustness of these LLM-based MASs, especially under knowledge conflicts, remains unclear. In this paper, we design four comprehensive metrics to investigate the robustness of MASs when facing mild or task-critical knowledge conflicts. We first analyze mild knowledge conflicts introduced by heterogeneous agents and find that they do not harm system robustness but instead improve collaborative decision-making. Next, we investigate task-critical knowledge conflicts by synthesizing knowledge conflicts and embedding them into one of the agents. Our results show that these conflicts have surprisingly little to no impact on MAS robustness. Furthermore, we observe that MASs demonstrate certain self-repairing capabilities by reducing their reliance on knowledge conflicts and adopting alternative solution paths to maintain stability. Finally, we conduct ablation studies on the knowledge conflict number, agent number, and interaction rounds, finding that the self-repairing capability of MASs has intrinsic limits, and all findings hold consistently across various factors. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/wbw625/MultiAgentRobustness.

Abstract: Predicting variations in complex traffic environments is crucial for the safety of autonomous driving. Recent advancements in occupancy forecasting have enabled forecasting future 3D occupied status in driving environments by observing historical 2D images. However, high computational demands make occupancy forecasting less efficient during training and inference stages, hindering its feasibility for deployment on edge agents. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, i.e., OccProphet, to efficiently and effectively learn occupancy forecasting with significantly lower computational requirements while improving forecasting accuracy. OccProphet comprises three lightweight components: Observer, Forecaster, and Refiner. The Observer extracts spatio-temporal features from 3D multi-frame voxels using the proposed Efficient 4D Aggregation with Tripling-Attention Fusion, while the Forecaster and Refiner conditionally predict and refine future occupancy inferences. Experimental results on nuScenes, Lyft-Level5, and nuScenes-Occupancy datasets demonstrate that OccProphet is both training- and inference-friendly. OccProphet reduces 58\%$\sim$78\% of the computational cost with a 2.6$\times$ speedup compared with the state-of-the-art Cam4DOcc. Moreover, it achieves 4\%$\sim$18\% relatively higher forecasting accuracy. Code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/JLChen-C/OccProphet.

Abstract: Fast shipping and efficient routing are key problems of modern logistics. Building on previous studies that address package delivery from a source node to a destination within a graph using multiple agents (such as vehicles, drones, and ships), we investigate the complexity of this problem in specialized graphs and with restricted agent types, both with and without predefined initial positions. Particularly, in this paper, we aim to minimize the delivery time for delivering a package. To achieve this, we utilize a set of collaborative agents, each capable of traversing a specific subset of the graph and operating at varying speeds. This challenge is encapsulated in the recently introduced Drone Delivery Problem with respect to delivery time (DDT).
  In this work, we show that the DDT with predefined initial positions on a line is NP-hard, even when considering only agents with two distinct speeds. This refines the results presented by Erlebach, et al.[ELS22], who demonstrated the NP-hardness of DDT on a line with agents of arbitrary speeds. Additionally, we examine DDT in grid graphs without predefined initial positions, where each drone can freely choose its starting position. We show that the problem is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of $O(n^{1-\varepsilon}$), where $n$ is the size of the grid, even when all agents are restricted to two different speeds as well as rectangular movement areas. We conclude by providing an easy $O(n)$ approximation algorithm.

Abstract: AI agents are AI systems that can achieve complex goals autonomously. Assessing the level of agent autonomy is crucial for understanding both their potential benefits and risks. Current assessments of autonomy often focus on specific risks and rely on run-time evaluations -- observations of agent actions during operation. We introduce a code-based assessment of autonomy that eliminates the need to run an AI agent to perform specific tasks, thereby reducing the costs and risks associated with run-time evaluations. Using this code-based framework, the orchestration code used to run an AI agent can be scored according to a taxonomy that assesses attributes of autonomy: impact and oversight. We demonstrate this approach with the AutoGen framework and select applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results in sequential decision-making tasks. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged, exhibiting impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding and reasoning. These advances have led to a surge of research integrating LLMs and VLMs into RL. In this survey, we review representative works in which LLMs and VLMs are used to overcome key challenges in RL, such as lack of prior knowledge, long-horizon planning, and reward design. We present a taxonomy that categorizes these LLM/VLM-assisted RL approaches into three roles: agent, planner, and reward. We conclude by exploring open problems, including grounding, bias mitigation, improved representations, and action advice. By consolidating existing research and identifying future directions, this survey establishes a framework for integrating LLMs and VLMs into RL, advancing approaches that unify natural language and visual understanding with sequential decision-making.

Abstract: Given the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), an important question arises: Can LLMs conduct human-like scientific research and discover new knowledge, and act as an AI scientist? Scientific discovery is an iterative process that demands efficient knowledge updating and encoding. It involves understanding the environment, identifying new hypotheses, and reasoning about actions; however, no standardized benchmark specifically designed for scientific discovery exists for LLM agents. In response to these limitations, we introduce a novel benchmark, \textit{Auto-Bench}, that encompasses necessary aspects to evaluate LLMs for scientific discovery in both natural and social sciences. Our benchmark is based on the principles of causal graph discovery. It challenges models to uncover hidden structures and make optimal decisions, which includes generating valid justifications. By engaging interactively with an oracle, the models iteratively refine their understanding of underlying interactions, the chemistry and social interactions, through strategic interventions. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, Gemini, Qwen, Claude, and Llama, and observe a significant performance drop as the problem complexity increases, which suggests an important gap between machine and human intelligence that future development of LLMs need to take into consideration.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of maximizing social welfare while ensuring fairness in a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) setting. In this problem, a centralized decision-maker takes actions over time, generating random rewards for various agents. Our goal is to maximize the sum of expected cumulative rewards, a.k.a. social welfare, while ensuring that each agent receives an expected reward that is at least a constant fraction of the maximum possible expected reward.
  Our proposed algorithm, RewardFairUCB, leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) technique to achieve sublinear regret bounds for both fairness and social welfare. The fairness regret measures the positive difference between the minimum reward guarantee and the expected reward of a given policy, whereas the social welfare regret measures the difference between the social welfare of the optimal fair policy and that of the given policy.
  We show that RewardFairUCB algorithm achieves instance-independent social welfare regret guarantees of $\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$ and a fairness regret upper bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$. We also give the lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for both social welfare and fairness regret. We evaluate RewardFairUCB's performance against various baseline and heuristic algorithms using simulated data and real world data, highlighting trade-offs between fairness and social welfare regrets.

Abstract: Understanding collective pedestrian movement is crucial for applications in crowd management, autonomous navigation, and human-robot interaction. This paper investigates the use of sequential deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers, for real-time flock detection in multi-pedestrian trajectories. Our proposed approach consists of a two-stage process: first, a pre-trained binary classification model is used for pairwise trajectory classification, and second, the learned representations are applied to identify multi-agent flocks dynamically.
  We validate our method using real-world group movement datasets, demonstrating its robustness across varying sequence lengths and diverse movement patterns. Experimental results indicate that our model consistently detects pedestrian flocks with high accuracy and stability, even in dynamic and noisy environments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to identify other forms of collective motion, such as convoys and swarms, paving the way for more comprehensive multi-agent behavior analysis.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning plays a crucial role in vehicle control by guiding agents to learn optimal control strategies through designing or learning appropriate reward signals. However, in vehicle control applications, rewards typically need to be manually designed while considering multiple implicit factors, which easily introduces human biases. Although imitation learning methods does not rely on explicit reward signals, they necessitate high-quality expert actions, which are often challenging to acquire. To address these issues, we propose a reward-free reinforcement learning framework (RFRLF). This framework directly learns the target states to optimize agent behavior through a target state prediction network (TSPN) and a reward-free state-guided policy network (RFSGPN), avoiding the dependence on manually designed reward signals. Specifically, the policy network is learned via minimizing the differences between the predicted state and the expert state. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RFRLF in controlling vehicle driving, showing its advantages in improving learning efficiency and adapting to reward-free environments.

Abstract: This work addresses the practical problem of distributed formation tracking control of a group of quadrotor vehicles in a relaxed sensing graph topology with a very limited sensor set, where only one leader vehicle can access the global position. Other vehicles in the formation are assumed to only have access to inter-agent bearing (direction) measurements and relative velocities with respect to their neighbor agents. A hierarchical control architecture is adopted for each quadrotor, combining a high-gain attitude inner-loop and an outer-loop bearing-based formation controller with collision avoidance augmentation. The proposed method enables a group of quadrotors to track arbitrary bearing persistently exciting desired formations, including time-varying shapes and rotational maneuvers, such that each quadrotor only requires relative measurements to at least one neighboring quadrotor. The effective performance of the control strategy is validated by numerical simulations in MATLAB and real-world experiments with three quadrotors.

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, the environment changes caused by agents or human activities make it extremely challenging for robots to perform various long-term tasks. To effectively understand and adapt to dynamic environments, the perception system of a robot needs to extract instance-level semantic information, reconstruct the environment in a fine-grained manner, and update its environment representation in memory according to environment changes. To address these challenges, We propose \textbf{DynamicGSG}, a dynamic, high-fidelity, open-vocabulary scene graph generation system leveraging Gaussian splatting. Our system comprises three key components: (1) constructing hierarchical scene graphs using advanced vision foundation models to represent the spatial and semantic relationships of objects in the environment, (2) designing a joint feature loss to optimize the Gaussian map for incremental high-fidelity reconstruction, and (3) updating the Gaussian map and scene graph according to real environment changes for long-term environment adaptation. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the performance and efficacy of the proposed method in terms of semantic segmentation, language-guided object retrieval, and reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we have validated the dynamic updating capabilities of our system in real laboratory environments. The source code will be released at:~\href{https://github.com/GeLuzhou/Dynamic-GSG}{https://github.com/GeLuzhou/DynamicGSG}.

Abstract: Multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MAMAB) is a classic collaborative learning model and has gained much attention in recent years. However, existing studies do not consider the case where an agent may refuse to share all her information with others, e.g., when some of the data contains personal privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel limited shared information multi-agent multi-armed bandit (LSI-MAMAB) model in which each agent only shares the information that she is willing to share, and propose the Balanced-ETC algorithm to help multiple agents collaborate efficiently with limited shared information. Our analysis shows that Balanced-ETC is asymptotically optimal and its average regret (on each agent) approaches a constant when there are sufficient agents involved. Moreover, to encourage agents to participate in this collaborative learning, an incentive mechanism is proposed to make sure each agent can benefit from the collaboration system. Finally, we present experimental results to validate our theoretical results.

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) are characterized by a variety of practical constraints, making manual solver design both knowledge-intensive and time-consuming. Although there is increasing interest in automating the design of routing algorithms, existing research has explored only a limited array of VRP variants and fails to adequately address the complex and prevalent constraints encountered in real-world situations. To fill this gap, this paper introduces RoutBench, a benchmark of 1,000 VRP variants derived from 24 attributes, for evaluating the effectiveness of automatic routing solvers in addressing complex constraints. Along with RoutBench, we present the Automatic Routing Solver (ARS), which employs Large Language Model (LLM) agents to enhance a backbone algorithm framework by automatically generating constraint-aware heuristic code, based on problem descriptions and several representative constraints selected from a database. Our experiments show that ARS outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based methods and commonly used solvers, automatically solving 91.67% of common VRPs and achieving at least a 30% improvement across all benchmarks.

Abstract: Generating presentation slides is a time-consuming task that urgently requires automation. Due to their limited flexibility and lack of automated refinement mechanisms, existing autonomous LLM-based agents face constraints in real-world applicability. We decompose the task of generating missing presentation slides into two key components: content generation and layout generation, aligning with the typical process of creating academic slides. First, we introduce a content generation approach that enhances coherence and relevance by incorporating context from surrounding slides and leveraging section retrieval strategies. For layout generation, we propose a textual-to-visual self-verification process using a LLM-based Reviewer + Refiner workflow, transforming complex textual layouts into intuitive visual formats. This modality transformation simplifies the task, enabling accurate and human-like review and refinement. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of alignment, logical flow, visual appeal, and readability.

Abstract: Hierarchical organization is fundamental to biological systems and human societies, yet artificial intelligence systems often rely on monolithic architectures that limit adaptability and scalability. Current hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approaches typically restrict hierarchies to two levels or require centralized training, which limits their practical applicability. We introduce TAME Agent Framework (TAG), a framework for constructing fully decentralized hierarchical multi-agent systems.TAG enables hierarchies of arbitrary depth through a novel LevelEnv concept, which abstracts each hierarchy level as the environment for the agents above it. This approach standardizes information flow between levels while preserving loose coupling, allowing for seamless integration of diverse agent types. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAG by implementing hierarchical architectures that combine different RL agents across multiple levels, achieving improved performance over classical multi-agent RL baselines on standard benchmarks. Our results show that decentralized hierarchical organization enhances both learning speed and final performance, positioning TAG as a promising direction for scalable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: A significant and growing number of published scientific articles is found to involve fraudulent practices, posing a serious threat to the credibility and safety of research in fields such as medicine. We propose Pub-Guard-LLM, the first large language model-based system tailored to fraud detection of biomedical scientific articles. We provide three application modes for deploying Pub-Guard-LLM: vanilla reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation, and multi-agent debate. Each mode allows for textual explanations of predictions. To assess the performance of our system, we introduce an open-source benchmark, PubMed Retraction, comprising over 11K real-world biomedical articles, including metadata and retraction labels. We show that, across all modes, Pub-Guard-LLM consistently surpasses the performance of various baselines and provides more reliable explanations, namely explanations which are deemed more relevant and coherent than those generated by the baselines when evaluated by multiple assessment methods. By enhancing both detection performance and explainability in scientific fraud detection, Pub-Guard-LLM contributes to safeguarding research integrity with a novel, effective, open-source tool.

Abstract: Modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have made significant advances in handling continuous action spaces. However, real-world control systems--especially those requiring precise and reliable performance--often demand formal stability, and existing DRL approaches typically lack explicit mechanisms to ensure or analyze stability. To address this limitation, we propose SALSA-RL (Stability Analysis in the Latent Space of Actions), a novel RL framework that models control actions as dynamic, time-dependent variables evolving within a latent space. By employing a pre-trained encoder-decoder and a state-dependent linear system, our approach enables both stability analysis and interpretability. We demonstrated that SALSA-RL can be deployed in a non-invasive manner for assessing the local stability of actions from pretrained RL agents without compromising on performance across diverse benchmark environments. By enabling a more interpretable analysis of action generation, SALSA-RL provides a powerful tool for advancing the design, analysis, and theoretical understanding of RL systems.

Abstract: Principal-agent problems model scenarios where a principal incentivizes an agent to take costly, unobservable actions through the provision of payments. Such problems are ubiquitous in several real-world applications, ranging from blockchain to the delegation of machine learning tasks. In this paper, we initiate the study of hidden-action principal-agent problems under approximate best responses, in which the agent may select any action that is not too much suboptimal given the principal's payment scheme (a.k.a. contract). Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm to compute an optimal contract under approximate best responses. This positive result is perhaps surprising, since, in Stackelberg games, computing an optimal commitment under approximate best responses is computationally intractable. We also investigate the learnability of contracts under approximate best responses, by providing a no-regret learning algorithm for a natural application scenario where the principal has no prior knowledge about the environment.

Abstract: Despite the abundance of prior social strategies possessed by humans, there remains a paucity of research dedicated to their transfer and integration into social agents. Our proposed SOTOPIA-{\Omega} framework aims to address and bridge this gap, with a particular focus on enhancing the social capabilities of language agents. This framework dynamically injects multi-step reasoning strategies inspired by negotiation theory, along with two simple direct strategies, into expert agents, thereby automating the construction of high-quality social dialogue training corpus. Additionally, we introduce the concept of Social Instruction Following (S-IF) and propose two new S-IF evaluation metrics that are complementary to social capability. We demonstrate that several 7B models trained on high-quality corpus not only significantly surpass the expert agent (GPT-4) in achieving social goals but also enhance S-IF performance. Analysis and variant experiments validate the advantages of dynamic construction, which can especially break the agent's prolonged deadlock.

Abstract: Constructing photorealistic virtual worlds has applications across various fields, but it often requires the extensive labor of highly trained professionals to operate conventional 3D modeling software. To democratize this process, we introduce WorldCraft, a system where large language model (LLM) agents leverage procedural generation to create indoor and outdoor scenes populated with objects, allowing users to control individual object attributes and the scene layout using intuitive natural language commands. In our framework, a coordinator agent manages the overall process and works with two specialized LLM agents to complete the scene creation: ForgeIt, which integrates an ever-growing manual through auto-verification to enable precise customization of individual objects, and ArrangeIt, which formulates hierarchical optimization problems to achieve a layout that balances ergonomic and aesthetic considerations. Additionally, our pipeline incorporates a trajectory control agent, allowing users to animate the scene and operate the camera through natural language interactions. Our system is also compatible with off-the-shelf deep 3D generators to enrich scene assets. Through evaluations and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the versatility of WorldCraft, ranging from single-object customization to intricate, large-scale interior and exterior scene designs. This system empowers non-professionals to bring their creative visions to life.

However, previous GS-based methods primarily target indoor scenes and rely on RGB-D sensors or pre-trained depth estimation models, hence underperforming in outdoor scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a RGB-only gaussian splatting SLAM method for unbounded outdoor scenes--OpenGS-SLAM. Technically, we first employ a pointmap regression network to generate consistent pointmaps between frames for pose estimation. Compared to commonly used depth maps, pointmaps include spatial relationships and scene geometry across multiple views, enabling robust camera pose estimation. Then, we propose integrating the estimated camera poses with 3DGS rendering as an end-to-end differentiable pipeline. Our method achieves simultaneous optimization of camera poses and 3DGS scene parameters, significantly enhancing system tracking accuracy. Specifically, we also design an adaptive scale mapper for the pointmap regression network, which provides more accurate pointmap mapping to the 3DGS map representation. Our experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that OpenGS-SLAM reduces tracking error to 9.8\% of previous 3DGS methods, and achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained traction for its success in solving complex tasks for robotic applications. However, its deployment on physical robots remains challenging due to safety risks and the comparatively high costs of training. To avoid these problems, RL agents are often trained on simulators, which introduces a new problem related to the gap between simulation and reality. This paper presents an RL pipeline designed to help reduce the reality gap and facilitate developing and deploying RL policies for real-world robotic systems. The pipeline organizes the RL training process into an initial step for system identification and three training stages: core simulation training, high-fidelity simulation, and real-world deployment, each adding levels of realism to reduce the sim-to-real gap. Each training stage takes an input policy, improves it, and either passes the improved policy to the next stage or loops it back for further improvement. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves the desired performance. The pipeline's effectiveness is shown through a case study with the Boston Dynamics Spot mobile robot used in a surveillance application. The case study presents the steps taken at each pipeline stage to obtain an RL agent to control the robot's position and orientation.

Abstract: The leading AI companies are increasingly focused on building generalist AI agents -- systems that can autonomously plan, act, and pursue goals across almost all tasks that humans can perform. Despite how useful these systems might be, unchecked AI agency poses significant risks to public safety and security, ranging from misuse by malicious actors to a potentially irreversible loss of human control. We discuss how these risks arise from current AI training methods. Indeed, various scenarios and experiments have demonstrated the possibility of AI agents engaging in deception or pursuing goals that were not specified by human operators and that conflict with human interests, such as self-preservation. Following the precautionary principle, we see a strong need for safer, yet still useful, alternatives to the current agency-driven trajectory. Accordingly, we propose as a core building block for further advances the development of a non-agentic AI system that is trustworthy and safe by design, which we call Scientist AI. This system is designed to explain the world from observations, as opposed to taking actions in it to imitate or please humans. It comprises a world model that generates theories to explain data and a question-answering inference machine. Both components operate with an explicit notion of uncertainty to mitigate the risks of overconfident predictions. In light of these considerations, a Scientist AI could be used to assist human researchers in accelerating scientific progress, including in AI safety. In particular, our system can be employed as a guardrail against AI agents that might be created despite the risks involved. Ultimately, focusing on non-agentic AI may enable the benefits of AI innovation while avoiding the risks associated with the current trajectory. We hope these arguments will motivate researchers, developers, and policymakers to favor this safer path.

Abstract: A major challenge for reinforcement learning is automatically generating curricula to reduce training time or improve performance in some target task. We introduce SEBNs (Skill-Environment Bayesian Networks) which model a probabilistic relationship between a set of skills, a set of goals that relate to the reward structure, and a set of environment features to predict policy performance on (possibly unseen) tasks. We develop an algorithm that uses the inferred estimates of agent success from SEBN to weigh the possible next tasks by expected improvement. We evaluate the benefit of the resulting curriculum on three environments: a discrete gridworld, continuous control, and simulated robotics. The results show that curricula constructed using SEBN frequently outperform other baselines.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand people's mental variables based on their behavior, is key to developing socially intelligent agents. Current approaches to Theory of Mind reasoning either rely on prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), which are prone to systematic errors, or use rigid, handcrafted Bayesian Theory of Mind (BToM) models, which are more robust but cannot generalize across different domains. In this work, we introduce AutoToM, an automated Bayesian Theory of Mind method for achieving open-ended machine Theory of Mind. AutoToM can operate in any domain, infer any mental variable, and conduct robust Theory of Mind reasoning of any order. Given a Theory of Mind inference problem, AutoToM first proposes an initial BToM model. It then conducts automated Bayesian inverse planning based on the proposed model, leveraging an LLM as the backend. Based on the uncertainty of the inference, it iteratively refines the model, by introducing additional mental variables and/or incorporating more timesteps in the context. Empirical evaluations across multiple Theory of Mind benchmarks demonstrate that AutoToM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a scalable, robust, and interpretable approach to machine Theory of Mind.

Abstract: Cooperative intelligence (CI) is expected to become an integral element in next-generation networks because it can aggregate the capabilities and intelligence of multiple devices. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a popular approach for achieving CI in communication problems by enabling effective collaboration among agents to address sequential problems. However, ensuring privacy protection for MARL is a challenging task because of the presence of heterogeneous agents that learn interdependently via sharing information. Implementing privacy protection techniques such as data encryption and federated learning to MARL introduces the notable overheads (e.g., computation and bandwidth). To overcome these challenges, we propose PP-MARL, an efficient privacy-preserving learning scheme for MARL. PP-MARL leverages homomorphic encryption (HE) and differential privacy (DP) to protect privacy, while introducing split learning to decrease overheads via reducing the volume of shared messages, and then improve efficiency. We apply and evaluate PP-MARL in two communication-related use cases. Simulation results reveal that PP-MARL can achieve efficient and reliable collaboration with 1.1-6 times better privacy protection and lower overheads (e.g., 84-91% reduction in bandwidth) than state-of-the-art approaches.

该文探讨了安全帕累托改进(SPIs)如何缓解预期效用最大化的代理人在混合动机协调问题（如Chicken游戏）中的协调失败。SPIs被定义为对策略配置进行的变换，以确保所有玩家在变换后的配置下必然得到更好的结果。文章考虑了一种情景，其中玩家提交可以基于对方代码做出决策的计算机程序，并利用这一特性通过具有重新谈判能力的程序构建SPIs。研究发现，在玩家信念满足轻微条件的情况下，每个玩家总是倾向于使用重新谈判。进一步地，类似假设下，每个玩家总是倾向于至少愿意重新谈判到他们能在任何有效结果中获得的最低收益水平。因此，主观最优策略保证了玩家至少能获得这些收益，而无需就特定的帕累托改进达成一致。然而，重新谈判并不能保证玩家在这方面超越这个界限。 <div>

Abstract: Agents in mixed-motive coordination problems such as Chicken may fail to coordinate on a Pareto-efficient outcome. Safe Pareto improvements (SPIs) were originally proposed to mitigate miscoordination in cases where players lack probabilistic beliefs as to how their delegates will play a game; delegates are instructed to behave so as to guarantee a Pareto improvement on how they would play by default. More generally, SPIs may be defined as transformations of strategy profiles such that all players are necessarily better off under the transformed profile. In this work, we investigate the extent to which SPIs can reduce downsides of miscoordination between expected utility-maximizing agents. We consider games in which players submit computer programs that can condition their decisions on each other's code, and use this property to construct SPIs using programs capable of renegotiation. We first show that under mild conditions on players' beliefs, each player always prefers to use renegotiation. Next, we show that under similar assumptions, each player always prefers to be willing to renegotiate at least to the point at which they receive the lowest payoff they can attain in any efficient outcome. Thus subjectively optimal play guarantees players at least these payoffs, without the need for coordination on specific Pareto improvements. Lastly, we prove that renegotiation does not guarantee players any improvements on this bound.

Abstract: Understanding the 3D semantics of a scene is a fundamental problem for various scenarios such as embodied agents. While NeRFs and 3DGS excel at novel-view synthesis, previous methods for understanding their semantics have been limited to incomplete 3D understanding: their segmentation results are rendered as 2D masks that do not represent the entire 3D space. To address this limitation, we redefine the problem to segment the 3D volume and propose the following methods for better 3D understanding. We directly supervise the 3D points to train the language embedding field, unlike previous methods that anchor supervision at 2D pixels. We transfer the learned language field to 3DGS, achieving the first real-time rendering speed without sacrificing training time or accuracy. Lastly, we introduce a 3D querying and evaluation protocol for assessing the reconstructed geometry and semantics together. Code, checkpoints, and annotations are available at the project page.

Abstract: The surge in connected devices in 6G with typical complex tasks requiring multi-user cooperation, such as smart agriculture and smart cities, poses significant challenges to unsustainable traditional communication. Fortunately, the booming artificial intelligence technology and the growing computational power of devices offer a promising 6G enabler: semantic communication (SemCom). However, existing deep learning-based SemCom paradigms struggle to extend to multi-user scenarios due to its increasing model size with the growing number of users and its limited compatibility with complex communication environments. Consequently, to truly empower 6G networks with this critical technology, this article rethinks generative SemCom for multi-user system and proposes a novel framework called ``M-GSC" with the large language model (LLM) as the shared knowledge base (SKB). The LLM-based SKB plays three critical roles, that is, complex task decomposition, semantic representation specification, and semantic translation and mapping, for complex tasks, spawning a series of benefits such as semantic encoding standardization and semantic decoding personalization. Meanwhile, to enhance the performance of M-GSC framework, we highlight three optimization strategies unique to this framework: extending the LLM-based SKB into a multi-agent LLM system, offloading semantic encoding and decoding, and managing communication and computational resources. Finally, a case study is conducted to demonstrate the preliminary validation on the effectiveness of the M-GSC framework in terms of efficient decoding offloading.

Abstract: As reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) emerge as a pivotal technology in the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) networks, their deployment within practical multiple operator (OP) networks presents significant challenges, including the coordination of RIS configurations among OPs, interference management, and privacy maintenance. A promising strategy is to treat RIS as a public resource managed by an RIS provider (RP), which can enhance resource allocation efficiency by allowing dynamic access for multiple OPs. However, the intricate nature of coordinating management and optimizing RIS configurations significantly complicates the implementation process. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) approach that decomposes the complicated RIS resource optimization problem into several subtasks. Specifically, a top-level RP-agent is responsible for RIS allocation, while low-level OP-agents control their assigned RISs and handle beamforming, RIS phase-shifts, and user association. By utilizing the semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) theory, we establish a sophisticated interaction mechanism between the RP and OPs, and introduce an advanced hierarchical proximal policy optimization (HPPO) algorithm. Furthermore, we propose an improved sequential-HPPO (S-HPPO) algorithm to address the curse of dimensionality encountered with a single RP-agent. Experimental results validate the stability of the HPPO algorithm across various environmental parameters, demonstrating its superiority over other benchmarks for joint resource optimization. Finally, we conduct a detailed comparative analysis between the proposed S-HPPO and HPPO algorithms, showcasing that the S-HPPO algorithm achieves faster convergence and improved performance in large-scale RIS allocation scenarios.

Abstract: On-device control agents, especially on mobile devices, are responsible for operating mobile devices to fulfill users' requests, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions. Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into these agents enhances their ability to understand and execute complex commands, thereby improving user experience. However, fine-tuning MLLMs for on-device control presents significant challenges due to limited data availability and inefficient online training processes. This paper introduces DistRL, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online RL fine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralized training and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning in the context of dynamic online interactions. Additionally, the framework is backed by our tailor-made RL algorithm, which effectively balances exploration with the prioritized utilization of collected data to ensure stable and robust training. Our experiments show that, on average, DistRL delivers a 3X improvement in training efficiency and enables training data collection 2.4X faster than the leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, after training, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks from an open benchmark, significantly outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the same training time. These results validate DistRL as a scalable and efficient solution, offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency and agent performance for real-world, in-the-wild device control tasks.

Abstract: Shared control problems involve a robot learning to collaborate with a human. When learning a shared control policy, short communication between the agents can often significantly reduce running times and improve the system's accuracy. We extend the shared control problem to include the ability to directly query a cooperating agent. We consider two types of potential responses to a query, namely oracles: one that can provide the learner with the best action they should take, even when that action might be myopically wrong, and one with a bounded knowledge limited to its part of the system. Given this additional information channel, this work further presents three heuristics for choosing when to query: reinforcement learning-based, utility-based, and entropy-based. These heuristics aim to reduce a system's overall learning cost. Empirical results on two environments show the benefits of querying to learn a better control policy and the tradeoffs between the proposed heuristics.

本文针对部分可观测环境下强化学习（RL）中的挑战进行了研究，探讨了利用特权信息（如来自模拟器的状态访问）的优势。文章首先形式化并指出了“专家蒸馏”（又称“教师-学生”学习）在找到近似最优策略时可能存在的问题。接着，提出了一种名为“确定性滤波条件”的环境条件，在此条件下，专家蒸馏可以实现样本和计算复杂度均为多项式级的效率。随后，研究了另一种实用方法——不对称actor-critic，在可观察的部分可观测马尔科夫决策过程中，设计了一个信念加权的不对称actor-critic算法，其具有多项式级样本复杂度和准多项式级计算复杂度。其中，关键组件是一个新的可证明的信念状态学习Oracle，该Oracle能在模型误配情况下保证滤波稳定性。此外，文章还考察了具有特权信息的部分可观测多智能体RL（MARL）的可证效率，提出了采用集中训练与分布式执行框架的多项式级样本和（准）多项式级计算复杂度的算法。相较于近期相关理论研究，本文更侧重于理解实践启发式的算法范式，同时避免了使用计算上不可行的Oracle。 <div>

Abstract: Partial observability of the underlying states generally presents significant challenges for reinforcement learning (RL). In practice, certain \emph{privileged information}, e.g., the access to states from simulators, has been exploited in training and has achieved prominent empirical successes. To better understand the benefits of privileged information, we revisit and examine several simple and practically used paradigms in this setting. Specifically, we first formalize the empirical paradigm of \emph{expert distillation} (also known as \emph{teacher-student} learning), demonstrating its pitfall in finding near-optimal policies. We then identify a condition of the partially observable environment, the \emph{deterministic filter condition}, under which expert distillation achieves sample and computational complexities that are \emph{both} polynomial. Furthermore, we investigate another useful empirical paradigm of \emph{asymmetric actor-critic}, and focus on the more challenging setting of observable partially observable Markov decision processes. We develop a belief-weighted asymmetric actor-critic algorithm with polynomial sample and quasi-polynomial computational complexities, in which one key component is a new provable oracle for learning belief states that preserve \emph{filter stability} under a misspecified model, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we also investigate the provable efficiency of partially observable multi-agent RL (MARL) with privileged information. We develop algorithms featuring \emph{centralized-training-with-decentralized-execution}, a popular framework in empirical MARL, with polynomial sample and (quasi-)polynomial computational complexities in both paradigms above. Compared with a few recent related theoretical studies, our focus is on understanding practically inspired algorithmic paradigms, without computationally intractable oracles.

<br /><br />总结:
该研究关注多智能体系统中利用大规模语言模型进行自然对话的问题，提出了一种新的框架——“谋杀之谜代理人”，将对话分析中的对话规范（如相邻对和轮流机制）应用于AI代理的对话控制。通过使用需要复杂社会推理和信息操作的回合制推理游戏“谋杀之谜”作为评估目标，该框架整合了基于相邻对的下一个说话者选择以及考虑了代理内部状态的自我选择机制，以实现更自然和策略性的对话。实验结果表明，实施下一个说话者选择机制显著减少了对话中断，提高了代理人分享信息和进行逻辑推理的能力。这项研究表明，人类会话中的轮流机制规律同样适用于AI代理间的对话控制，并为构建更高级的多智能体对话系统提供了设计指南。 <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent systems utilizing large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in achieving natural dialogue. However, smooth dialogue control and autonomous decision making among agents still remain challenges. In this study, we focus on conversational norms such as adjacency pairs and turn-taking found in conversation analysis and propose a new framework called "Murder Mystery Agents" that applies these norms to AI agents' dialogue control. As an evaluation target, we employed the "Murder Mystery" game, a reasoning-type table-top role-playing game that requires complex social reasoning and information manipulation. In this game, players need to unravel the truth of the case based on fragmentary information through cooperation and bargaining. The proposed framework integrates next speaker selection based on adjacency pairs and a self-selection mechanism that takes agents' internal states into account to achieve more natural and strategic dialogue. To verify the effectiveness of this new approach, we analyzed utterances that led to dialogue breakdowns and conducted automatic evaluation using LLMs, as well as human evaluation using evaluation criteria developed for the Murder Mystery game. Experimental results showed that the implementation of the next speaker selection mechanism significantly reduced dialogue breakdowns and improved the ability of agents to share information and perform logical reasoning. The results of this study demonstrate that the systematics of turn-taking in human conversation are also effective in controlling dialogue among AI agents, and provide design guidelines for more advanced multi-agent dialogue systems.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) requires the agent to finish a given task while obeying specific constraints. Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.

总结:
本文关注于在LLM-agent世界模拟中控制对话多样性的关键问题，指出长期模拟中对话多样性显著下降。通过模块化对话生成提示，研究发现减少给定信息可以带来更丰富的输出。因此，文章提出了一个名为“适应性提示修剪”（APP）的新方法，该方法让用户能够通过单一参数lambda来动态调整并控制输出多样性。APP根据注意力权重动态地裁剪对话生成提示，并与传统的多样性控制技术兼容。实验表明APP能有效控制输出多样性，并提出一种平衡控制权衡的方法。此外，文中还进行了深入分析，为优化多智能体模拟中的多样性控制提供了见解。 <div>

Abstract: Controlling diversity in LLM-agent world simulations is essential for maintaining stability in structured tasks while enabling variation where creativity is needed. However, we observe that dialogue diversity declines significantly over long-term simulation. To investigate the role of prompt design in conversational diversity, we modularized the utterance generation prompt and found that reducing the given information leads to more diverse outputs. Based on this insight, we propose Adaptive Prompt Pruning (APP), a novel method that allows users to control diversity through a single parameter, lambda. APP dynamically prunes the utterance generation prompt based on their attention weights and is compatible with traditional diversity control techniques. We demonstrate that APP effectively controls output diversity through extensive experiments, and propose a method to balance the control trade-offs. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis to offer insights into optimizing diversity control in multi-agent simulation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables an agent interacting with an unknown MDP $M$ to optimise its behaviour by observing transitions sampled from $M$. A natural entity that emerges in the agent's reasoning is $\widehat{M}$, the maximum likelihood estimate of $M$ based on the observed transitions. The well-known \textit{certainty-equivalence} method (CEM) dictates that the agent update its behaviour to $\widehat{\pi}$, which is an optimal policy for $\widehat{M}$. Not only is CEM intuitive, it has been shown to enjoy minimax-optimal sample complexity in some regions of the parameter space for PAC RL with a generative model~\citep{Agarwal2020GenModel}.
  A seemingly unrelated algorithm is the ``trajectory tree method'' (TTM)~\citep{Kearns+MN:1999}, originally developed for efficient decision-time planning in large POMDPs. This paper presents a theoretical investigation that stems from the surprising finding that CEM may indeed be viewed as an application of TTM. The qualitative benefits of this view are (1) new and simple proofs of sample complexity upper bounds for CEM, in fact under a (2) weaker assumption on the rewards than is prevalent in the current literature. Our analysis applies to both non-stationary and stationary MDPs. Quantitatively, we obtain (3) improvements in the sample-complexity upper bounds for CEM both for non-stationary and stationary MDPs, in the regime that the ``mistake probability'' $\delta$ is small. Additionally, we show (4) a lower bound on the sample complexity for finite-horizon MDPs, which establishes the minimax-optimality of our upper bound for non-stationary MDPs in the small-$\delta$ regime.

Abstract: Recent advances in hierarchical policy learning highlight the advantages of decomposing systems into high-level and low-level agents, enabling efficient long-horizon reasoning and precise fine-grained control. However, the interface between these hierarchy levels remains underexplored, and existing hierarchical methods often ignore domain symmetry, resulting in the need for extensive demonstrations to achieve robust performance. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Equivariant Policy (HEP), a novel hierarchical policy framework. We propose a frame transfer interface for hierarchical policy learning, which uses the high-level agent's output as a coordinate frame for the low-level agent, providing a strong inductive bias while retaining flexibility. Additionally, we integrate domain symmetries into both levels and theoretically demonstrate the system's overall equivariance. HEP achieves state-of-the-art performance in complex robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in both simulation and real-world settings.

Abstract: Intelligent tutoring agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly explored to deliver personalized guidance in areas such as language learning and science education. However, their capabilities in guiding users to solve complex real-world tasks remain underexplored. To address this limitation, in this work, we focus on coding tutoring, a challenging problem that requires tutors to proactively guide students toward completing predefined coding tasks. We propose a novel agent workflow, Trace-and-Verify (TRAVER), which combines knowledge tracing to estimate a student's knowledge state and turn-by-turn verification to ensure effective guidance toward task completion. We introduce DICT, an automatic evaluation protocol that assesses tutor agents holistically using controlled student simulation and code generation tests. Extensive experiments reveal the challenges of coding tutoring and demonstrate that TRAVER achieves a significantly higher success rate. Although we use code tutoring as an example in this paper, our results and findings can be extended beyond coding, providing valuable insights into advancing tutoring agents for a variety of tasks.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a key task in Embodied AI, requiring agents to navigate diverse and unseen environments while following natural language instructions. Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.

Abstract: In the field of MLLM-based GUI agents, compared to smartphones, the PC scenario not only features a more complex interactive environment, but also involves more intricate intra- and inter-app workflows. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical agent framework named PC-Agent. Specifically, from the perception perspective, we devise an Active Perception Module (APM) to overcome the inadequate abilities of current MLLMs in perceiving screenshot content. From the decision-making perspective, to handle complex user instructions and interdependent subtasks more effectively, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent collaboration architecture that decomposes decision-making processes into Instruction-Subtask-Action levels. Within this architecture, three agents (i.e., Manager, Progress and Decision) are set up for instruction decomposition, progress tracking and step-by-step decision-making respectively. Additionally, a Reflection agent is adopted to enable timely bottom-up error feedback and adjustment. We also introduce a new benchmark PC-Eval with 25 real-world complex instructions. Empirical results on PC-Eval show that our PC-Agent achieves a 32% absolute improvement of task success rate over previous state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent/tree/main/PC-Agent.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in automating machine learning tasks. However, existing LLM-based agents often struggle with low-diversity and suboptimal code generation. While recent work has introduced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to address these issues, limitations persist in the quality and diversity of thoughts generated, as well as in the scalar value feedback mechanisms used for node selection. In this study, we introduce Introspective Monte Carlo Tree Search (I-MCTS), a novel approach that iteratively expands tree nodes through an introspective process that meticulously analyzes solutions and results from parent and sibling nodes. This facilitates a continuous refinement of the node in the search tree, thereby enhancing the overall decision-making process. Furthermore, we integrate a Large Language Model (LLM)-based value model to facilitate direct evaluation of each node's solution prior to conducting comprehensive computational rollouts. A hybrid rewarding mechanism is implemented to seamlessly transition the Q-value from LLM-estimated scores to actual performance scores. This allows higher-quality nodes to be traversed earlier. Applied to the various ML tasks, our approach demonstrates a 6% absolute improvement in performance compared to the strong open-source AutoML agents, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing agentic AutoML systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent coordination studies the underlying mechanism enabling the trending spread of diverse multi-agent systems (MAS) and has received increasing attention, driven by the expansion of emerging applications and rapid AI advances. This survey outlines the current state of coordination research across applications through a unified understanding that answers four fundamental coordination questions: (1) what is coordination; (2) why coordination; (3) who to coordinate with; and (4) how to coordinate. Our purpose is to explore existing ideas and expertise in coordination and their connections across diverse applications, while identifying and highlighting emerging and promising research directions. First, general coordination problems that are essential to varied applications are identified and analyzed. Second, a number of MAS applications are surveyed, ranging from widely studied domains, e.g., search and rescue, warehouse automation and logistics, and transportation systems, to emerging fields including humanoid and anthropomorphic robots, satellite systems, and large language models (LLMs). Finally, open challenges about the scalability, heterogeneity, and learning mechanisms of MAS are analyzed and discussed. In particular, we identify the hybridization of hierarchical and decentralized coordination, human-MAS coordination, and LLM-based MAS as promising future directions.
